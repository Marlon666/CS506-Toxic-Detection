Boy, that sure is convincing. So what we know is there's an FBI investigation of one Russian banker and *zero* evidence of it actually occurring is available to the public.

I_Fart_Liquids,"> The study was conducted among persons who attempted suicide by various methods and were admitted to hospital. The study population comprised 147 participants (33 males and 114 females) aged between 14 and 33 years.While those numbers do seem high enough to test an idea, I would like to see a poll with maybe a little more people and a more equal ratio of men to women. If the people who were used in the study were taken from somewhere other than the random populous (like say from a doctor who requested patients with a history of suicidal tendencies to take this—where men would be less likely to go than women after an unsuccessful attempt) than the results could also be skewed.

comeherebob,"Wow this one touched a nerve. I can't tell if it's because redditors are interpreting this article as an argument against gun control measures or if it's because the headline suggests a problem that is exclusive to men. Either way, I don't see how this is controversial. The US experiences disproportionately high rates of gun violence. Gun violence is disproportionately perpetrated by men (and men are also disproportionately the victims of it). We can work toward evidence-based restrictions on gun ownership while also discussing how to help American men. The latter issue is something that affects a multitude of other problems (and is a problem in itself!), so I don't see the benefit in *not* approaching the topic in a logical yet compassionate way. I'm female and have spent copious amounts of time on male-dominated internet communities and I can say with confidence that a lot y'all have some issues, and I don't mean that in a cruel or judgmental way. There just seem to be an endless well of depression, anxiety, and social isolation felt by a lot of guys out there, especially young ones. Addressing it might be part of the puzzle to solving issues like gun violence, but it could simultaneously go a long way toward helping the majority - i.e., guys who are struggling would never hurt someone else.

The unwillingness to engage with the reality of how young men think and feel just means that you hasten the social exclusion that creates the problem.Nor are mental health professionals a panacea.
