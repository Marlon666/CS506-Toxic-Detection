DelusionalSocialist,"Fair point. The only thing you really had to play for was not getting too much injuries and yellows, but the not conceding 7 goals thing was basically a given. On the other hand, the only thing the Netherlands realistically had to play for was one final hurray. Arjen Robben already said before the game that we should be honest and say that it's not going to happen. But we (or they) had the obligation to try, to show to the public that they still have some fire in them. The final game for the Netherlands was actually more about restoring honour then about winning by 7 goals. That was never going to happen.But I do agree that we shouldn't count this final game. If we both had something to play for then it would be a very different game. I think it's not unfair to say that in the first game the Netherlands was the better party. But this was also the best game of the Netherlands in the qualifiers while it was the worst game by Sweden. The Netherlands got worse throughout the tournament while Sweden got better. That's what some old Swedish international said anyway in some news article. At this final stage of the tournament Sweden played better than the Netherlands did. It is not unreasonable to think that we would have lost if both parties had something to fight for.If we look throughout the entire qualifiers, Sweden clearly deserved the spot more than the Netherlands. But that's something that I never denied. I actually live in Sweden right now, so I'm very content with the WC ticket. Unfortunately I'll be in the Netherlands during the WC itself, but I will be cheering for Sweden.",0.004431118257343769,1.0052415291283978e-06,0.0006285880808718503,1.1803675079136156e-05,0.0001679428096394986,6.273143662838265e-05

DelusionalSocialist,"To give credit where credit's due, Sweden's run still was impressive. Especially with Zlatan gone, lots of people didn't think they could do it. The Netherlands may not be at top form at the moment, in my view they're still about an equal match to Sweden right now. (Which showed during the two head-to-head games). Getting even a play-off spot was far from a gaurantee.This was probably the thoughest group around facing both France and the Netherlands. Before the qualifiers started Sweden was probably underdog with respect to both teams (despite the Dutch performance last years), and then they faced Italy in the play-offs, a team that has not faced elimination in 60 years.The WC ticket is more than deserved. As a matter of fact, I actually live in Sweden at the moment so I've been cheering for the country as well. The tragic thing is that I'm visiting the Netherlands during the world cup though.**Edit:** Forgot about Bulgaria. While not world-class, it's not the easiest opponent in this tier either.

And you got only 1 point against the Netherlands, so it's not like you really exploited the weak position of the Netherlands you had to get your points against countries that *were* in form. You don't survive this group and then beat Italy just because of luck.Same with many Dutch people complaining how unlucky we were in our run (denied 2-1 against Sweden away and also Sweden beating France). If you miss two major tournaments in a row it's not bad luck anymore. It's not one game that we blew, it's a total of 20 at this moment (Euro+WC), at that point it's not a fluke anymore.It was an impressive run from Sweden.

izcaranax,"That's because Italy didn't colonize us and the Italians that came here were mostly poor uneducated workers who didn't speak Standard Italian well and spoke mostly their regional dialects. Then lots of them were educated in Argentine schools in Spanish. That was the case of my grandparents.At the beginning most of them spoke a Italian-Spanish pidgin called ""Cocoliche"". And there was also ""Lunfardo"", an Spanish dialect spoken mostly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the lower classes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Lunfardo is known mostly for Tango lyrics). Nowadays you have the Rioplatense Spanish, a dialect spoken in Buenos Aires and Uruguay, it's the famous dialect asociated with Argentines. It has intonation patterns similar to Italian and A LOT of slang derived from Italian. Of course, as a ""porteño"", I speak this dialect of Spanish and when I talk with Spanish speakers from other countries I have to ""neutralize"" my Spanish to be understood.Finally, lots of Argentineans learnt Italian (something like 1,5 M, 3,4% of the population) but not because they use it on a daily basis.

WikiTextBot,**IIHF World Ranking**The IIHF World Ranking is a ranking of the performance of the national ice hockey teams of member countries of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments. The current leader in rankings is Canada in men's play and the United States in women's play.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,0.10756532102823257,8.181432349374518e-05,0.02372019924223423,0.0005203908076509833,0.00826070737093687,0.0020992145873606205

It also pushes the NHL playoffs deeper into the MLB season. They don't want to compete with the NBA and MLB more than they already have to.2) Sending players to the Olympics has the potential to injure them. Players on the Olympics tend to be the best players on NHL teams. So to lose them for any amount of time is horrible to an NHL team.3) The Olympics don't bring that many new viewers to the NHL. The difference is negligible. The NHL seems slower post-Olympics so it really slows down their ratings.You don't have to agree. But these are the reasons the owners don't want players to go.

My suggestion to Janne is that he opens a vote for all the players if they want Zlatan back (given that he wants to) and base his decision off that. If Zlatan comes back he will get all creds for anything good that happens so this is a sacrifice the other players must make so therefore they should be a part of the decision process.

If we win that game we faced Ukraine next up, they navigated an easy group overcoming Saudi and Tunisia to finish behind Spain.

Your guy fell like he was shot, but Materazzi actually hit Zambrotta's shin. Once you see that called as a red, you have to know that the ref is being strict on the day. Regardless even in Sunday league you don't tackle in the box at the 90th minute of a game unless a) you're absolutely sure you'll get clean contact on the ball b) you're doing it to stop a certain goal. The intervention on grosso was goofy and uncoordinated. He completely missed the ball and obstructed a guy in the box that had just run 30 meters full throttle in the last minute of an elimination game. No way in hell that any player worth its salt would stay up in that situation, and your players were smart enough that they would have absolutely done the same.
