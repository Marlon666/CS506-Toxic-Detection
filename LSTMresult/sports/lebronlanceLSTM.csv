It ultimately allowed KD's move (not a fan of, but players can do what they want of course). I don't think his legacy moves much either way (in your scenario joining the Warriors makes anything moving forward obsolete, although I doubt they'd even want him for chemistry reasons. At least with losing to them he can say he tried) but I tend to rank him lower than this sub for sure. I have him top 10, but we in an inflated era of stats and I think in 10 years we'll see that more clearly. Personally I think LeBron never wins another ring and there's a great chance the Celtics, Bucks, whoever begins coming out of the east next year (hell could this year tbh the way the Cavs look lately). Hopefully he can just enjoy the years he has left playing the game & not worry too much about ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù and chasing ghosts.I grew up watching MJ & Kobe a lot and toward the end (especially with Kobe) you could see the drive still but injuries, media fatigue, expectations, etc was tough to watch weigh on him as he knew he couldn't win anymore.",0.016669182,6.1682357e-07,0.006508976,3.325502e-05,0.0024270609,0.00010607466

I actually already addressed that. But here we are, with you still attempting to remove context to make me feel bad for a one-liner. Here you are, still on this one subject even though I clearly stated my position, attempting to use domestic violence as a weapon in some sort of internet posting joust that you constructed yourself and now intend on winning. Some might read your posts and think that you don't really care about Lance Stephenson's victim and instead only care about winning this argument you started and then have sustained on your own.> Well that's not true.

I mean, you certainly reminded me that he was a piece of shit almost a decade ago when he was 19 and (allegedly) did this.Yes we get it you (allegedly) think the victim lied about it. You've made that (allegedly) clear numerous times. Nobody couches these things in words like allegedly unless they're scared of being sued for libel (this is not a newspaper so you can't be) or if they think the accused is innocent and the victim is a liar. Makes me wonder whether you actually care about the victim blah blah blah.Regardless, not even a decade has passed. People don't deserve to be vilified for their mistakes forever, but I think beating the ever-loving shit out of someone who trusts you earns you the piece of shit label for a bit longer than 7 years or whatever it's been.> it raises the question about why you brought it up in the first place.Except I already answered that.
