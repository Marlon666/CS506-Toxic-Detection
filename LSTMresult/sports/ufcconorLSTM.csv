So it's like a sarcastic cry of ""ya I'm depressed who can relate? Wooo"" ugh...

BlackCatsAreMagic,"""Me seeing an ad does absolutely nothing if the UFC can't prove that I saw the ad."" is what you just posted. Either your purposefully muddying your responses so nobody can prove any specific thing you state wrong, or you aren't dealing with a full deck. Either way, I'll explain it for you in common man terms.Essentially, with ad tools and digital media, advertising becomes bidirectional. The result is more effective and targeted marketing investments. A good web marketing campaign requires specialists who know how to develop, publish, and monitor it, and it almost always yields the expected returns. That's why worldwide ad spending is going to reach $674 billion by the end of 2020 by eMarketer estimates.It may seem as though everyone has something to sell you. Publisher, advertiser, affiliate…everyone finds you fascinating! When I hear about marketing and read articles, I often see a lot of confusion about the entities involved in digital marketing. Let's cut through the confusion with a few brief but clear definitions.The advertiser (or merchant) kicks things off. This company wants to create an advertising campaign to promote its brand, product, or service. The advertiser pays for the promotion.Then there may be an advertising agency to act as an intermediary. In many cases, the advertiser doesn't have the knowledge and experience to create and lead an effective marketing campaign. Creativity and know-how are key, and ad agencies provide those. An ad agency can manage a marketing campaign from planning to publishing and beyond.The last piece of the puzzle is the publisher (or affiliate), an individual or organization that places advertising on digital platforms. Increasingly, big publishers provide full service in advertising, taking on the role of the ad agency as well.You may have heard the term affiliate networks as well. Affiliate networks are virtual spaces where advertisers find publishers and vice versa. Advertisers sign up, load their campaigns, and chose which affiliate program is most suitable. Publishers, in turn, join a network and offer their inventory in exchange for revenue.A variety of payment models exist. With pay-per-impression (or cost-per-impression, CPM), the advertiser pays a fee each time an ad is displayed, regardless of whether the user clicks on it.Another model, pay-per-click (or PPC or CPC) has the advertiser paying the publisher each time the ad is clicked.Finally, pay-per-action is a performance-based model. The advertiser pays each time an agreed action is performed by the user — signing up, say, or registering for a newsletter, buying a product, completing a survey, and so forth.Given the simplicity of the payment models above, it might seem easy to cheat the system and generate fake traffic. That is partly true, although anti-fraud systems mitigate the problem.One of the simplest methods for generating clicks is paid-to-click, which actually is not a scam: Real people really are rewarded for clicking on ads. This “easy money” scheme is fairly well known. People get drawn in by promises of getting big money for doing almost nothing — just clicking links a few hours a day. In reality, you would have to click all day, quickly and without breaks, to make even a few bucks.Another method involves automated scripts, such as ClickJacking. By using this technique, criminals can trick users and “hijack” clicks on some objects, routing them to another page.Then there is malware that can make botnets capable of generating traffic on infected computers for pay-per-click campaigns. Trojan-Clicker is the most prevalent click-fraud malware. This code remains in system memory and attempts to connect to specific Internet resources, such as online ads. That damages not only the digital marketing system, but also the users who unknowingly take part in the fraud.Edit: You can downvote this if you like /u/ablackguy22, but it still doesn't change the fact you are being sold as a product by your streaming service.",2.9403704e-05,6.840594e-11,2.7114203e-05,9.1701835e-08,2.7331714e-07,8.447466e-09

There is a difference between being arrested and convicted. Being arrested doesnt mean anything, you are not guilty of what you are arrested for until you are convicted. Employers in America don't look at arrest records, they look at what you have been found guilty of.

Hambjob,"I wonder if they'll try to throw on heavier penalties for the assault charge since he's technically trained to hurt people through assault. Like what happened to Nic Cage in Con Air. On a serious note, you could argue that he has trained to knock out his opponents quickly and with least resistance possible, meaning he is only trained to knock people unconscious with precision, not kill them with ease like Nic Cage in Con Air. Edit: On a serious note, punching anyone in the head or knocking someone unconscious can easily lead to a life-threatening brain hemorrhage due to the blunt force trauma sustained throughout the brain. If you hit your head wrong with just enough force blood seeps into your brain, strangles it through pressure, leaves you brain-damaged or dead. This is why assault is serious and why you should avoid a fight even if you know you can win.

EireIsMyLove,"A few would feel that way, especially with this recent incident. The reason is that he loves the spotlight so often he is in the spotlight, and someone like him acting the eejit and causing trouble will sadly create a negative image for Ireland. The reason is that people are stupid, so they'll judge millions of people based on the actions of 1 person or 100 people. When an athlete is representing a country, which he was, they are serving a diplomatic role whether they like it or not, this is why countries take such pride in the Olympics as an example. Some will disagree, but I think he's a poor representation of our people, and whether he likes it or not his status makes him a role model, and he's a shit role model behaving like that. He is just human though, but if he can't control himself, he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut and his nose clean or stay out of the spotlight.
