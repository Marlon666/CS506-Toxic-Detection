thetouristsquad,"I spend 5 hours masturbating before my prostate exams. I edge, and edge, and edge, until a butterfly sneezing on my taint could bring me to orgasm. I tactfully shuffle my way down to the doctor's office and when he lubes up I nearly cum every time. But I've trained my kegel muscles enough to the point where I can hold in Mount Vesuvius' wrath. Then as soon as he puts the smallest bit of pressure on my prostate I unleash with the fury of a lion hunting its prey. As the room gets covered in my hot sticky juices the doctor looks on disgusted and leaves the room. I always go to a hospital far away from where I live to get it so that I don't have to go in for surgery under the doctor that I busted to. Best thing is we have free healthcare here, so the doctor gets me off and it's covered by taxpayers. That's my fetish.

fagers91,"> Rules are rules, just because it was last minute doesn't mean it wasn't pen. I agree. That being said, in general, that's not really the nature of football refereeing. Rules change a bit as time goes by, a situation in the first 10 minutes might not be a yellow, however it will be a clear yellow later in the game. Webb has talked about this at length among others. Football is a sport where the referee is, to a larger degree than other sports, ""controlling"" the course of the game, in contrast to following the book to a point in every situation. That wouldn't even be possible, since many of the rules involve discretion. For example to what degree a player is allowed ""to go down"", they are allowed to go down when contact, because a penalty wont be given if a player stays up. There is however vague lines between going down by force, contact but could have kept going, overdoing it, and just plain simulation.

It's one of those calls where it might be easy to call anywhere outside the box b/c the consequences aren't as high, but we see this kind of thing all the time. It's a bit too soft in my opinion to affect a whole tournament over.I mean you could probably break down where his hand is, his leg, his knee, and how it affected Vazquez; but Vazquez also goes down way too easily.

AntiChr1st,"In hockey they can do both. It goes under embellishment.

TheRedJoker93,"People are letting blind hatred of my team keep them from seeing a very objectively clear reality. Benatia made a really stupid decision that was a clear penalty on Vazquez after getting away with quite a few tackles that could easily have seen yellows. Otherwise he played very very well. Madrid did not deserve to lose the tie over two matches just because of the most recent match being exciting. That is why it is two legged in the first place. Give credit where it is due. In this match, Juve played out of their minds and deserve credit. But football is fucking cruel sometimes despite the beauty. Be honest with yourselves also. At no point did Madrid's attack or control of the ball collapse like Barca did at Roma. Every goal got a response from the Bernabeu and the blancos. Even Gigi accepted that part. Please stop letting blind hatred take you away from the truth. Even I felt bad for Juve, but the score is the score and that was a clear penalty that Gigi would not have saved anyway. Let's add that Mehdi Benatia was still on the field afterwards! Juve could have ended the match with 9 men. For the record, I've never been keen to remember a match that we lost 3-1 at the Bernabeu.

AntiChr1st,"> its just tough to call in action It is, and it's not made easier by football insisting on only the one ref and the resistance against video reviews (which I've never understood, it's odd that people are so worried the ref might not fuck up). But the current rules around it also mean the players are encouraged to do it because it's such a low risk thing to do. It doesn't matter if it's against the rules when de facto it is a tool the players use and they use it because it works. The dive has to be really obvious to get punished. There are essentially 3 things that need to happen for diving to go away.1-They are currently not told to try to stay on their feet, this has 2 parts.a-you see players all the time who fall down screaming and laying there like they've broken a leg, and within 2 minutes they're running around like normal. Make it a mandatory health check when you do that, 15 minutes off the field to be looked at by a doctor while your team plays with ten or switch you out. That will be gone immediately.b-Embellishment should be added, because it requires players to try to keep on their feet and keep playing no matter what since you can get punished for going down too easily *Even if you were legitimately fouled*.2-add 2 assisting refs.3-The last is video reviews, including post game. If after a match it becomes obvious someone dove the punishment should come down and it should come down *hard*. I've suggested 5 game bans for it before with all games affected changed into a loss (though yes I realize I am being harsh there and something lower might be more reasonable).",3.3478215e-10,1.4944311e-21,2.2518284e-08,1.7188085e-12,4.615825e-09,6.0379687e-14

It was an angle from directly behind the goal that was shown one time during the foxsportsgo coverage here in America if anyone else has access to it! I was streaming it online so I can't rewind or anything. It shows pretty clearly that Vazquez was waiting on contact, and that the contact was minimal. In that situation, **in my opinion** I don't care if Peter Crouch has jumped on your back and wrapped 16 feet of arms and legs around you, you lung to make contact with ball. You don't collapse like a bag of bricks. Benatia was the only one of the two of them that even tried to go for the ball in the end lol. Not saying there was no contact by any means, just that it was minimal, and that it seems like Vazquez was trying to get a penalty more than he was trying to score. Again, this is in my personal opinion, but to me the referee should have waived it off and let extra time happen unless there was a goal in the next like 35 seconds.

You don't collapse like a bag of bricksThe contact is the foul, not how the player reacts to it. And you're saying Vaquez was 4 feet from goal, in a tied game, and decided to look for contact and a pen instead of trying to score the game winning goal? I dont buy it. It would take a very special kind of stupid to hope for a pen this close from goal.The fact is: Benatia comes in full speed and Vazquez is stationary. He tries to play the ball through him (literally) and makes contact both with his hand from the looks of it (or until someone finds that mysterious angle no one seems to have) and with his leg in his ribs.

petersow13,"I am exactly saying that Vazquez was 4 feet from goal and looking for contact haha. He probably did it because that ball was about to be awkward as **hell** for him to try to score - it kinds looks like he was considering chesting the ball, but that's obviously open to interpretation. Its unfortunately not a special kind of stupid, its the way the game has evolved in this current age. You are exactly right, shoving a player in the back makes the foul, not how the player reacts to it... except Benatia didn't shove Vazquez. Did he touch his back? Absolutely. But football is a contact sport, and in my opinion (and you are certainly entitled to your own opinion as well!) the contact was minimal, and Vazquez exaggerated it to get a penalty. I *love* Messi because he's one of the few prominent players in today's game that **tries to play through contact** like the beast that he is, even at 5'7''. [And he pulls off some *amazing* things doing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwF3oxvh3DI), because a lot of times the defenders assume he's gonna go down, and they let up for just a split second, and he's gone. And that's why I don't like the call - I want players to try to play through contact.Don't get me wrong, we've basically stumbled into a conversation about a systemic issue that goes much deeper than this one example - refs need to call fouls that occur even if the player **doesn't fall down**. The way it is now, refs tend to not call fouls if the player doesn't fall and make a scene, thereby giving offensive players an incentive to exaggerate contact. Until refs start calling fouls where players don't fall, while punishing players for exaggerating contact (not just blatant no contact dives) this will be an inherent issue in the sport we all love. Full Disclosure: I'm also biased - I played defense for years, and I was physical, but not dirty. People that dive drove me insane. Some people think there's an *art* to diving and deceiving referees, and I get it. That's just not me. It probably would be if I had played striker, but who knows. [Here](https://streamable.com/tqmh5) is the alternate angle (15 seconds in), but they stop it and don't let it play so its not nearly as clear that Vazquez was barely touched.

Majukun,"the main mistake here is a lack of communicaton between the juve defenders..sandro (i think?) doesn't follow chiellini and the other defender that are rising the line to put everyone in offside,so he ends up with ronaldo that passes him with great timing and has no choice but to follow him,but the rest of the defense line just isn't there anymore to cover the cross and benatia has to attempt a last desperate save.for the penalty i already said mine in the match thread...benatia's leg touches the ball but his hands are on the realmadrid guy's back and that's what the referee saw..whenever it's penalty or not depends on if the ""shove"" before the leg touches the ball is strong enough to damage the attacker (that does nothing to stay on his feet but it is his right to do so if the push was strong enough)..a difficult call to make without var and not easy even with var..an ex referee on a italian show is saying that if benatia touches the ball it can never be penalty,and he has obviously more experience than me..but i think that if the shove happened and happened before the leg touched the ball, there's ground for a penalty.funny thing...juve's chairman released an interview where he said that uefa should hurry implementing VAR in champions league since this kind of episodes change the fate of the entire tournament...but i remember clearly back at the start of serie A, when VAR was something new even for us italians..juve players and managers said that it was a damage for football and that with VAR ""it isn't football anymore"".how opinions change when you are the one damaged....",0.0043691723,2.144671e-13,0.00011607697,1.9149229e-07,0.0003957381,1.1806413e-07

bosnian_red,"Ridiculous, everyone is emotion driven and lose all reason. It's a foul anywhere on the pitch, any minute of the game. And the whole argument about ""giving a penalty in the 93rd minute kills the story""... The story was that Real Madrid were shit for 90 minutes but created a moment of quality at the end and created a clear goalscoring opportunity in the dying seconds, Vazquez from a few yards out ready to tap it in. The only thing Juve could do was foul him and hope the ref fucks up (which he didn't) or Ronaldo missed the pen (which he didn't). A story of almost there, but not quite good enough. Not a robbery at all. Being robbed is when an incorrect call kills you after you had the win. Not even yesterday where City benefitted for the first goal but then got one legitimate goal disallowed.
