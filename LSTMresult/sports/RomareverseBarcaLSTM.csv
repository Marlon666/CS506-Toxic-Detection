rod333,"To our r/all friends:Barcelona was having a great season. They haven't lost a single game in La Liga \(the Spanish league\) and they were playing the Champion's League, which pits the best teams in Europe against each other.In the Champion's League, you play two games: one at home and one visiting. In the first game, Barcelona handily beat Roma 4\-1.In this second game, Roma won 3\-0. This puts the overall score at 4\-4, which tied the teams. The tiebreaker is the most away\-game goals \(since it's harder\). Since Roma got that one goal in the other game, they beat Barcelona.No one expected this. It's kind of like the Patriots having a perfect season in 2007 then losing to the Giants in the Superbowl. Except, imagine if they lost in the quarterfinals to like, the 2007 Jaguars or something and the Jaguars came back from a three touchdown deficit in the second half. And if NFL teams played four times as many games, so perfect seasons were even rarer.**tl;dr \- HOLY FUCKING SHIT**Edit: Also, Barcelona had a similar comeback last year against PSG, making up a 4 goal deficit by beating them 6\-1. So this is extra schadenfraude for all the Barca haters out there :\)Edit 2: Barcelona is 24\-7\-0 in La Liga. They have 7 games left, so they can still lose the perfect season.

dearpisa,"Eusebio Di Francesco deserves more credits than you guys are giving here.This season is his first with Roma. Before Roma he managed Virtus Lanciano, Pescara, Lecce and Sassuolo. UCL semi-final? Check.Biggest game of the season, having nothing to lose, he played a system that is literally never used for the whole season at Roma. Roma is basically a copycat of Barcelona (lol) under Enrique: always a front three, either 4-3-3 or 3-4-3The three star players of the game, based on xG chain are respectively a Tottenham Hotspur reject (Fazio), a 35-year-old lad who is close to retirement and a Manchester City reject (Dzeko).Roma somehow dominated Barca for the whole 90 minutes, giving them two free own goals in the first leg and still got through.Really, some balls right there.",0.021035559475421906,4.94605592393782e-06,0.0038283495232462883,2.4468601623084396e-05,0.0015720004448667169,0.00046149169793352485

mpinzon93,"Valverde did a shit job this game, but it wasn't just his fault. The defense was bad, Iniesta was a liability even after being rested a lot lately, Sergi was terrible, and Suarez is declining back to his beginning of the season form. Valverde was nonexistant and such late subs were just useless, we needed Dembele way earlier. I feel like Barca got way too cocky with the lead, and not losing a game this season and I really hope this is a big slap in the face for this team and Valverde. Can't just blindly rely on Messi saving games every single time in the attack. I can even understand playing defensive witht he 4-1 lead, but as soon as the team shows the defence isn't in form, EV should have changed the game plan to our normal style.IDK, i'm livid but I hope this is a wake up call and at least Barca can win the double now that the league is basically wrapped up and only the CDR final is left.

ArsenLOL,"not even sure why this is controversial. Messi´s barcelona has chocked in the last 3 years in champions, ronaldo won 2 lol. Messi has had 4 goals scored in champions when the team is losing, ronaldo has had 22 when his team is losing. Cristiano is a leader and a strong athletic footballer with no match. Messi is a shy player with a lot of talent but he doesnt have the balls in the big matches and that is why ronaldo will always be considered the best in history no matter what messi fangirls think. Also lets not forget this isnt a controversial opinion. Cristiano has been named the best footballer aka ballon d or for the last 4 out of 5 times. Only in reddit this season messi is the ""Goat"" because he scores against noname teams in unimportant matches.

MattyBTraps42069,"Congrats to Roma first off.Take nothing away from the Roma players, they were fantastic from the start. Too many big names for Barça played absolutely shit. Pique played like absolute piss. Umtiti, as much as I love him, is a big factor in the loss. He completely gave up on the first goal, he could have prevented it. Pique and Umtiti played absolutely woeful, along with semedo. The entire midfield lacked any kind of creativity. There were no good passes strung together, and no type of good incisive runs to be seen at all. Suarez was invisible, we would have been better off playing paco if you ask me. Messi had an off game, which he will be unfairly slammed for, considering he brought the team this far on his own. Alba wasn't so bad, however his distribution was obviously bad. The only time in the entire match that I can say we even played decent was in the end when we were trying to push for the win. Even that was obviously nowhere near good enough.That brings me to this final point. Valverde. Why? Just why? The home leg against Roma was not a good performance, just a good result, and he plays the exact same team. He plays Sergi at RB the entire season, and in the UCL quarter finals, decided to experiment with him at RM. I know he's a natural midfielder, but out wide is not where he needs to be in the mid. Down by one, not so bad. Down two, obviously a bad situation, should make a sub. Down three? Changes need to be made. However, he waited until the 85th minute to make the second and third changes. Dembele should have STARTED, or at the very least should have come on far sooner than he did. He should have been an early second half sub. Paco as well, maybe just a bit later in. The persons who came in and out I can't argue with, it was the timing. Roma played excellent. The ref had a good game as well imo, and we played shite. Can't change it, still love the team and all the players we have. Forca Barça.",0.001264877151697874,7.234246623966101e-08,0.00025153596652671695,3.911586077265383e-07,6.23997621005401e-05,1.7128077161032706e-05
