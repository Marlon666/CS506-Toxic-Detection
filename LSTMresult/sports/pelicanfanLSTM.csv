reduxde,"aggressive finger pointing is the equivalent of a street fight in China, i've seen entire mobs of people aggressively pointing mere centimeters from each other's faces, whilst waggling their fingers haphazardly.However, finger-to-nose contact is strictly forbidden unless you want to fight a gang of 10 people with sticks. My brother in law had a road rage situation where both people jumped out of the car and finger pointing ensued. He accidentally poked the other guy's nose, and 10 of the guys friends jumped out of literally nowhere with sticks and beat him badly enough to cause a hairline fracture to his elbow.swear to god that's a true story. the other driver had to pay nearly $5,000 in damages, which was crippling to him and his family... to a Chinese person that's equivalent to an American being asked to pay $30,000",5.843985e-06,3.0248934e-16,1.5876374e-07,2.6291151e-09,6.2780276e-07,8.749474e-10

I couldn't tell you how many times I've been stopped by people asking what the hell I'm doing there. Maybe it's the dirt. Maybe I just look like an untrustworthy asshole. I dunno. But there's been no single place that I've walked into and not gotten hassled at least a little. One time, we had to get fiber into an office building. Some lady that worked on a floor we weren't even servicing tried physically yanking me out of the phone room. Luckily the grounds keeper was just around the corner out of her sight and asked what the hell she thought she was doing. She let me go, but didn't look happy that I was there all the same.

I was in an area that was just a huge office park, so no gas stations, fast food joints, basically any type of public restroom. So I parked in front of some software company, grabbed one of the windows from the truck, strapped on my tool belt and l walked up to the secretary with the window and told her I was meeting “Scott in maintenance” (because every maintenance team has a “Scott”) to replace a window in one of the restrooms. She gave me directions to where the maintenance team hung out, let me into the main building, where I did a number on a random bathroom. Then I left, passed the secretary, pointed at the window and said “still must be half-asleep, I brought the wrong size window from the truck”. She laughed and said she'd see me in a second.

highangler,My first nba game I went on the court as well. The 76ers could care less as long as you weren't center court or in the players way. At least it seemed that way. I played basketball all my life and ever since I was a kid all I wanted to do was touch a real nba ball. Call me weird but I have this thing where I want to associate things with touch. Like a turnbuckle from the wee. Always since I was kid I wanted to feel one. Anyway to my surprise the nba ball feels nothing like a ball you use in high school. It's like a rock and slippery leather rather than the padded kind the schools play with.,6.469753e-06,3.1366564e-16,3.953842e-06,5.789064e-10,9.974652e-07,1.8283558e-10
