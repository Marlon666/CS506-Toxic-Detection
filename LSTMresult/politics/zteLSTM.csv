Surely having these artfully backdoored phones (hardware and software) in Iran would give them insight that they otherwise wouldn't have? Petty, shortsighted and dumb move.What will happen instead? The cheap phones that Iran, etc, have an appetite for will still be sold. Instead of a US backdoored OS, they will use a Chinese backdoored OS instead.
