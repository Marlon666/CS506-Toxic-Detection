PapaLGH,"Since 2013 anytime Assad had a foothold on liberation there just happen to be a chemical attack with white helmets responding. It has happened 3 times. The earliest being 2013, then I believe in 2016/2017 w chlorine gas. The US struck back the last two times even to this day having no proof it was him. He had Trump withdraw troops from his region. Meaning he was winning. It was then just Assad and Russia going back and forth. And well would you look at that it happened again. Another chemical attack on his own people. Not defending his character but history is a circle. What does he have to gain? The UN is circle jerking about it saying they have to punish him, then they end the session by saying they have no proof it was him. Destabilization, military involvement, lives lost, rinse repeat. The only motive to do that would be that he would want to go to war with the world. And considering he's had statement after statement being grateful for trump withdrawing troops to focus on his own liberation he has absolutely no political or military motive to gas children. Edit: when Syrian armies advance and liberate cities from NATO/GCC backed insurgents, said insurgents claim a chemical attack via Assad. Let the barrel bombs come on down. Kids are just pawns in a bigger game controlled by central banking, military position, and certain globalist entities wanting destabilization. One more refugee crisis comin right up. Edit 2: why did military contractors donate to Hillary? Wanted a no fly zone in Syria. What would come from a no fly zone in Syria? [this](https://youtu.be/fmE9Jj-rEVs) Guess it was just a matter of time by the powers that be.

PM__ME__STUFFZ,">Since 2013 anytime Assad had a foothold on liberation there just happen to be a chemical attack with white helmets responding.While Assad is in the strongest position he has held in years - it is incorrect to assume that he is a step away of having complete control over the country - he still needs to deal with Idlib and then handling the Kurds to the north. The chemical attacks must be interpreted in this light. The idea that there have only been three chemical attacks is a very US centric idea, there have been three attacks that the US has really be responsive two (2013, 2017 and now 2018) but there have been dozens of chemical attacks, in fact there were dozens of attacks in 2013 alone. One of the reasons Assad continues to use chemical attacks is because most of the time it goes unnoticed (the use of chemical attacks is confirmed or reported until months later so there is no big international retaliation.)A second reason that Assad continues to us gas, even when it may seem against his strategic interests, is that its pretty damn effective tactically. After the gas attack the remaining rebels in Ghouta who had refused to surrender surrendered, and now the rebels in Idlib and the Kurds are eyeing these gas attacks wondering if they will be next. And Assad doesn't really give a shit if US troops are in the region for the moment - he knows that under Trump the US troops will withdraw once the rest of the country is secured (and that under Putin the Russian troops will remain.)",0.0057803886,2.0524121e-10,0.004559145,6.3276104e-08,3.4374963e-05,3.395302e-08

Widdleton5,"we're insane. If you meet a Marine that hasn't at anytime thought to themselves ""I wonder what plunging a bayonet into a dude's throat really feels like"" they're probably full of shit. A few things about Marines: they're the youngest branch of service so anything spoken about conflict involves incredibly dark humor that makes most people uncomfortable. It is this culture of the Marines that makes them so lethal. If a single Marine ever locked and loaded without the mindset they are the baddest motherfucker ever to walk the earth then their NCOs have failed them in their preparation for that task. The reality of military troops throughout history is the majority of them are 17-25 year old men. Doesn't matter if it's Iraq/Iran conflict, Egypt/Jordan/Lebanon vs Israel, or WW1 and WW2. The basic troop on each side is a man that hasn't yet become a father and still hasn't even touched their 30s and has the emotional immaturity that's prevalent in a barely legal adult. The Marines have focused on their training so that when our young citizens finish just four months worth of training they are ready to fight a tank with a fork if it's required. From the outside in it appears the brain washing is working but I assure you the results from Marine training with take an 18 year old from the most pampered, safe, and comfortable existence in human history and create the conditions that when they face an enemy from the toughest upbringing in the world today they will not just win they will annihilate them. Equipment alone can not give you that result. It takes the will to endanger yourself and the self control to do it effectively. The reason the majority of combatants are still alive in Iraq and Afghanistan is because everyone hates us. They're all eventually combatants. If we're paying someone to not kill us I don't think they're envisioning putting up a Walmart next to a Victoria's Secret in their local Bazaar anytime soon. There are many problems in the middle east and if we were just murdering every military aged male and calling it a day I don't think that'll even solve them. However in countless engagement Marines have distinguished themselves as battle ready and the good ones are able to train their subordinates so that when shit hits the fan again they can react with focus and clarity on what the mission needs. One last note I'll make about the Marines (and I guess all the services). We are losing too many combat veterans from the ranks due to the downturn and now the bullshit. Once the floodgates stopped cutting so many of the top guys (with years worth of deployments) the Headquarters of the Marine Corps basically left most of the hollow structure in tact and then just promoted people to fill the vacant ranks. This has lead to an incredible amount of enlisted troops hitting ranks like Corporal or even a fucking Sergeant in less than 3 years of service. The majority will do their jobs to the best of their ability but it wasn't even 6 years ago that entire swaths of the Sergeants throughout the service were being let go for not making the next rank with 9-12 years of total service and now that we're building forces up again the HQMC has filled those 11 year (4 combat deployments) Sergeants with 3 year (1.5 of it in bootcamp/MCT/Tech school) troops. I think for the first time since 2001 the majority of the Marine Corps has not had a combat deployment. Add in the fact all of our shit is broken and our aircraft are deathtraps and sure, let's invade Syria while we're at it. That'll show em.",0.22970329,2.6700948e-09,0.010200419,1.1850851e-06,0.0009550892,2.4663086e-06

The story, which was immediately condemned as fake news by Trump and people who don't read above a fourth-grade level, was confirmed by The New York Times, Reuters, the Associated Press, and Russian news agency the GRU.>According to sources, Trump's latest disclosure prompted Mattis to begin shoving his entire desk outside his Pentagon window in what officials described as something of a reenactment of a scene from the film “A Beautiful Mind.” The secretary one-upped the character of John Nash however, throwing one of his aides onto the desk four stories below the window before firing into his lifeless body with his personal .44 Magnum.>At press time, a recently-captured western intelligence asset inside the Islamic State was expressing thanks that Trump's national security advisor H.R.

Billmarius,"You reminded me of a passage from my favorite lecture series:>""Until the time of Julius Caesar, Rome's conquests were essentially private enterprises. Romancitizens who went to war came back with booty, slaves, and a flow of tribute exacted by local agentson commission whose techniques included extortion and loansharking. Cicero claims that Brutus lentmoney to a Cypriot town at an interest rate of 48 per cent — evidently a common practice, and anearly precedent for Third World debt.14>Whether they were well-born patricians or overnight millionaires, Rome's soldiers of fortunewanted to enjoy and display their winnings at home. The result was a land boom everywhere withinrange of the capitol. Peasants were dispossessed and driven onto unsuitable land, with environmentalconsequences like those that Solon had recognized in Athens. Family farms could not compete againstbig estates using slave labour; they went bankrupt or were forced to sell out, and their young menjoined the legions. The ancient commons of the Roman peasantry were alienated with even lesslegality. As in Sumer, public land passed quickly into private hands, a situation the Gracchus brotherstried to remedy with land reform in the late second century B.C. But the reform failed, the commonswere lost, and the state had to placate the lower orders by handing out free wheat, a solution thatbecame expensive as the urban proletariat increased. By the time of Claudius, 200,000 Romanfamilies were on the dole.15>One of the revealing ironies of Rome's history is that the city-state's native democracy withered asits empire grew. Real power passed from the senate into the willing hands of field commanders, suchas Julius Caesar, who controlled whole armies and provinces. It must be said that in return for power,Caesar gave Rome intelligent reforms — a precedent often invoked by despots impatient with the law.“Necessity,” wrote Milton, is always “the tyrant's plea.”16>Ancient civilizations were generally of two types — city-state systems or centralized empires —both of which arose independently in the Old and New worlds.17 With the eclipse of its republic by itsempire, Rome changed from the first kind of polity into the second. (A similar evolution hashappened in other times and places, but is not by any means inevitable. Several modern countries,including Canada and the United States, show characteristics of both types.)>Some years after Julius Caesar 's murder and a further round of civil wars, the senate made a dealwith Caesar 's great-nephew Octavian, who took the name Augustus and the new office of princeps.These measures were supposed to be a special case, for his lifetime only. In theory, he was the chiefmagistrate and the writ of the republic still ran. In reality, a new age of quasi-monarchy had begun.18The empire had outgrown the institutions of its founding city.""Ronald Wright: [2004 CBC Massey Lectures:](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-2004-cbc-massey-lectures-a-short-history-of-progress-1.2946872) **A Short History of Progress**",0.0014223644,3.554144e-11,0.000298092,7.670763e-08,1.8916884e-05,6.5768006e-08
