But will Kentucky folks be okay without Kynect? I'm not sure.

ComesWithTheFall,"Man-made climate change is propaganda. The earth has been warming for 160 years. Look up Randall Carlson on the Joe Rogan podcast (JRE 501, they get into it around the 30m mark https://youtu.be/R31SXuFeX0A?t=28m48s). The global temps have oscillated for hundreds of thousands of years, as far back as we can measure. Carbon dioxide isn't the cause, and man-made carbon dioxide is actually trivial. It's all propaganda, probably designed to make every person naturally in debt by simply breathing. This doesn't mean the climate isn't changing. It has always changed and *will* continue to change, no matter what you or I do. Temperature graph from the Greenland ice core: https://chriscolose.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/easterbrook.jpgAs you can see, it's not even that warm by comparison. Life also flourishes in warmer temps. The sky is probably not falling (yet), and it's almost certainly not caused by man. The next ice age is what should worry you.Edit: The 97% of scientists myth that's being repeated here is fake news. Pure propaganda. http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303480304579578462813553136 https://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/05/30/the-myth-of-the-97-climate-change-consensus/Challenge: engage in discussion about the merits of climate change without citing a made up stat as an appeal-to-authority fallacy.The XKCD koolaid-drinker graph that's being posted here by some people is an intentionally deceptive graph, by the way. It's graphing the acceleration of change in temperature, not the absolute change in temperature, and it's compared to the average change within an arbitrary time period of 1961-1990, which I suppose is needed to get the dramatic results.So on the graph between 1961-1990 it's comparing the temperature changes in that period to the average temperature changes in the same period. Gee, no wonder it looks completely level then suddenly goes slightly haywire when it reaches 1990. Shit graph.

I'm always interested in people that believe that entire fields of science are propaganda.I would assume you're aware that [97% of climate scientists agree that human actions are the majority driving factor in global warming.](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/)So that raises an interesting question. Do you believe that 97% of scientists have actively engaged in a global conspiracy to perpetuate financial burdens on the working class? Have you ever set foot in a university or done research work to see how insane that would be? Are you aware that the most lucrative scientific careers are made by disproving consensus, and that there are enormous direct and indirect incentives to show that the prevailing theory is *wrong*. Are you aware that science works through working to actively debunk hypotheses, rather than supporting them, and that a 97% consensus is almost unheard of in scientific theories.And beyond that, you're saying that the motive for this conspiracy is to put people in debt. Do you think that having the consumer class be in debt is good for the upper class? Debt in the consumer class causes defaults, which lead to massive market volatility and recession, like in the last housing crisis, and reduced spending, which shrinks GDP and causes corporations to downsize. No economist would ever recommend putting unnecessary financial burden on the consumers. And beyond that, the actual financial burden of climate change regulation starts with burdening large corporations with additional overhead, which is bad for the upper class. Why would the upper class conspire to raise their overhead? At least Trump's ""conspiracy by the Chinese to make US manufacturing noncompetitive"" is just deluded rather than a complete non-sequitur. And the only alternative to them being in a conspiracy, I suppose, would be that you think that the entirety of the field of climate scientists consists of idiots, and that 10s of thousands of PhD researchers who dedicated their entire lives to the topic have just failed to match the output of your superior intellect coupled to 30 minutes of research on Joe Rogan's podcast.",1.2950482e-09,2.0031852e-26,6.519194e-10,2.950622e-15,1.9766535e-09,1.3141901e-14

melodyze,"I'm sorry, but that article is not science. It's an opinion piece, that doesn't cite any sources, about one metastudy on climate scientists. I've actually done research on climatology in an academic setting. Ironically, you're the one linking propaganda. I hope you'll at least read my post and form your own opinion outside of opinion pieces by people who clearly have an agenda and don't have expertise on the subject.There are other metastudies than just that one too. There are actually so many of those studies that I don't have time to link them all. I'd recommend that you comb through the citations on the [very extensive wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change) on the topic and form your own opinion, rather than basing your opinion on opinion pieces by WSJ and people on Joe Rogan's podcast. That's not science. It's not even that complicated of a topic. There's no mystery in academia behind the causes of global warming. It's just an amalgamation of very, very well understood, indisputable physics. I think some people think that climate science is a kind of magic box that puts out a binary answer of yes it's our fault or no it's not. That's not at all true. Do you accept that different gasses have different absorption spectra? That just means that gasses absorb different wavelengths of light (mostly infared from the sun) in different amounts. It's well established. If you take a bottle of atmospheric air and a bottle of CO2/methane/water vapor and put them infront of a heat lamp you will be able to measure that the bottle with the greenhouse gas gets warmer. It's a simple experiment that's been done thousands of times (although far, far more precisely). Try it for yourself. That physical effect obviously applies to any system with incident infared radiation, like our atmosphere. That effect is easily testable by using our mathematical models for rise in global mean temperature, and seeing if they can predict that climate of other planets given their atmospheric breakdown. And it works great! [Venus is an excellent case study](http://ircamera.as.arizona.edu/NatSci102/NatSci102/lectures/venus.htm) and it's climate fits with our model for an atmosphere with a high concentration of gases with high solar absorptivity (greenhouse gases). This of course being in addition to consistency with historical data. I think people get confused at whether or not human CO2 output accounts for the majority of atmospheric CO2, and think that that has to be true for human actions to drive climate change. It doesn't. The climate is a delicate balance. Much of the ""natural"" causes of climate change are feedback systems. This means that their contribution to cooling is a positive function of global mean temperature. Many of these examples are easy to understand. [The most powerful greenhouse gas is actually not CO2, but water vapor](https://www.skepticalscience.com/water-vapor-greenhouse-gas.htm). And [the amount of water vapor that atmospheric air can hold is strongly proportional to temperature.](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Kinetic/relhum.html) So water vapor concentration in the atmosphere is correlated to rise in atmospheric temperature... And rise in atmospheric temperature is correlated to rise in atmospheric water vapor concentration... That's called a feedback loop.Another one is the high reflectivity of ice sheets compared to the lower reflectivities of water or land. That means that as ice sheets melt, less of the incident radiant heat is reflected away from earth and more is absorbed in the sea and land, which in turn increases warming which melts more ice, etc. These effects mean that even relatively small increases in carbon emissions can have amplified effects on climate. It also means that we can reach a point in which cutting 100% of carbon emissions wouldn't stop warming. And that's really bad. [Average predictions on rises in global mean temperature show an expected 2 degrees celcius rise in global mean temperature](https://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/spmsspm-projections-of.html) and many think that is optimistically predicated on carbon cuts today.

You're only relying on ""I'm a pilot, lol"" which has nothing to do with the topic at hand. Your experience flying an aircraft doesn't give you any special knowledge here.I guess you sort of made one argument, which is that it's expensive to fly lots of aircraft. You're assuming it takes an enormous amount of aircraft flying at 40k feet. It may not require many planes over a large area and it may not require that altitude. Checkout the US secret spacecraft: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-37I'm not saying you're wrong.

shreddolls,I made a quick reply to his/Her post. I asked about chemtrails which is what most conspiracy theories think contrails are. He/she said they knew the difference between them. This implying it was different AC spreading the chemicals to cause a world wide climate change to benefit some faction. My argument to that although not directly contradicting the chemistry of adding salt and aluminum to the atmosphere was based on a financial one. It would be untold Trillions to fund such a project. I'm not sure your reference to an autonomous high altitude AC. The plane i currently fly goes over 40k the altitude isn't the problem. It would be the size or # of AC to disperse enough into the atmosphere to cause a significant change. Metals and salts wouldn't carry very far even if put into a jet stream thus would have to be dropped directly over weather systems to disrupt them. Again this brings me back to the infrastructure required to do all of this. Apologies if I didn't answer what you were looking for.

No. But its a pragmatic stop gap that will definitely benefit the US economy if we adopt it more and american businesses license the technology to emerging economies. In the same way we store spent nuclear waste, CO2 would be captured from coal burning and stored underground. Or it can be recycled and used in production. By capturing and reusing potentially 80-90% of CO2 it could be put back into food and beverage, paper and metal manufacturing.

As far as trumps plans for scope and length. I didnt bother looking at them cause I didnt vote for the guy.

What you posted in your message board post is almost close to verbatim from the Wikipedia page on Radioactive Waste which uses it in the bibliography of those numbers. The problem is that its 24 year old research before cleaner coal technology was barely being invested in. The very things in place now and being further developed are the things that make coal wildly less hazardous to people and the environment. As far as the waste. Stack scrubbers capture 99% of all Fly ash according to the EPA. The rest of the ash is used in landfills and now recently somewhere between 40-60% of it being recycled into concrete and asphalt. >With fossil fuels, you have to deal with all kinds of externalities from greenhouse gas emissions, acid rain, the mining industry and associated health problems (black lung, back, neck issues, etc), that simply don't exist with nuclear power.CO2 Sequestrion would eliminate 80-90% of GHG Emissions, Acid Rain is caused by Sulfur and NOx thats addressed with desulfurization and specialized burners which reduce NOx by 50-60% and even more as we develop more CC technology. People against this are just plain impractical. Not only does over 50% of the world run on coal, the US is in the 40% area. To properly power the US at given power consumptions the US would need more nuclear power plants than there are in the entire world today. At the costs of around 9 Billion for a new plant, you're looking at a cost over $3.5 trillion just for the creation and not even accounting for anything else. I'm for nuclear power. I think its clean and safe. I'm for wind, solar, hydro power. Until we get to the point of widespread national and global cost effective means of getting all of us on 100% clean renewable energy, im in favor of using coal too. People and Im not even meaning you, are ridiculous. They don't want coal because of the hazards. Technology is developed that *significantly* reduces the hazards and potentially eliminates upwards of 80-90% of the hazards and they don't want that either. A whole generation of people who have a pie in the sky perspective of they want clean energy, but no one has an economically feasible plan of how to get us there considering clean renewable energy only gets us at 17% of our energy output. That fact that people are so against making fossil fuels safer and healthier is absolute insanity. Im completely on their side with clean energy. But closing your eyes and saying ""NO I DONT WANT FOSSIL FUELS"" doesn't address our real problems in the meantime while we keep investing in clean energy until it becomes cheap enough to expand it and wind down our fossil fuel production.

And that's for the most state of the art coal plants, not the ones that are a few decades or even a few years old.Sure, making coal cleaner is great, but the industry is already dying on its own because of cheaper, safer, healthier, more viable, and better paying alternatives.

In my state any water that exists for 90+ days out of the year, that you can walk up and stick your hand in is considered a state surface water. Most qualify as high-quality state waters, though some exemptions exist. This includes irrigation ditches, meaning you need to consider to impact of your septic system to that ditch as if that ditch could be used for swimming and recreation.Infuriating at times. However it is because once its surface water, you're not going to get much treatment of the water. Once it stops being groundwater and starts being surface water, what you see is what you get. So no, nobody is going to be swimming in or drinking out of that irrigation ditch, but you can be damn sure that water will eventually end up in a place where that is likely.",1.6433685e-06,4.103236e-18,6.7955334e-05,1.8844044e-11,1.7788431e-09,1.479471e-13

In my roadside ditch example, we were doing a road widening, which in effect moved the ditches over about 5 feet. This was considered a permanent impact to Waters of the US and we had to pay for mitigation credits. I tried to make the case it was a temporary impact since we were replacing the ditches but the Army Corps wouldn't buy it.

chrisarg72,"You're mistaken, comparatively, Shale is much more democratic than coal as there are lower barriers to entry. Setting up a shale drill costs only $5 million to $10 million, most of which can be financed through loans. Considering that setting up a McDonalds franchise requires a $2 million investment on average, this is the equivalent of setting up two to five Mcdonalds stores. Sure, a poor person could not afford this. But someone in the high middle class, to low rich class can easily take out a loan and their home and start drilling for shale gas or oil. Meanwhile, coal mines cost about $100-300 million to establish. This is beyond the reach of anyone but a large multinational corporation and the select few insanely rich of the world.Edit: also not to bore you, it is easier to secure a loan against a shale pump than a coal mine. This is because the majority of costs with shale involve purchasing the physical drill and fracking equipment. These drills are easy to transport and have high resale value, so most banks will give you an ABL, or asset based loan, to buy one as they know they can easily seize the equipment if you go bankrupt and recover the majority of a loan. Coal on the other hand involves a lot of exploration and set up costs (digging up the mine, getting it ready to extract, etc) this cannot be transported or resold other than at that mine. Thus if you strike out, unlike shale, your assets are worthless.

gladoseatcake,"> shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of AmericansI'm curious about this one. Even though I have no illusion of the planet being rid of oil, gas and coal as sources for power in the near future, more and more countries are trying real hard to be 100% renewable within 20-30 years. Even if they don't succeed within that time frame, chances are that fossil fuel will decrease in value due to lower demand. If this happens within the next 10-15 years (I believe it will begin to happen way sooner, and a sign of this is that the Arabic countries have invested in other sources of income than oil for some time now), what will become of Trumps promises?

There are a lot of places in middle america where you don't really have many other options for your news source.Yes, I know in the era of the internet that's no much of an excuse, but the fact that this shit is so prevalent basically ingrains this way of thinking into the culture and political lexicon of huge swaths of this country. You'd basically have to actively question the views and opinions of a lot of the people in your region and social/familial circles in order to ""overcome"" this bias, which is something that, unfortunately, doesn't happen nearly enough as it should. Fox News, for example, is a basic channel. When Rupert Murdoch started it, he intentionally lost like half a billion dollars in the first few years by not making it a premium channel, so that it would be as available as possible. More liberal mainstream sources, MSNBC for example, are premium channels that you have to pay extra for.

abelisntright,"I'm not disagreeing that to an extent it's definitely their fault, but the point I was trying to make there was not exactly ""fear of standing up for what's factual and true,"" but more that it doesn't even *occur* to them that the information they are surrounded by isn't true, simply due to its ubiquity. Due to the lack of exposure to other ways of thinking or information that challenges their worldview, the only conclusions they can draw about the world are drawn from shitty, biased, and sometimes completely fabricated sources. I guess I see this issue as more of one about resources, or opportunity.It's similar to the conservative argument that people in low socio-economic situations should just ""get a job,"" or ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps and work harder!"" This way of thinking doesn't really consider ""well, do these people actually have the *resources* to do that?"" Of course there are exceptions, but these people are undoubtedly starting off at a deficit. Do you know what I mean? Again, I see what you're saying, but I don't really see the utility in just writing off huge chunks of the people in this country. To just say that they are ""stupid"" or ""bad"" in some way misses some key bits of the larger picture. To stick with my prior analogy, it would be like drawing the racist/classist conclusion that those of a low socio-economic background disproportionately engage in criminal/gang activity because of something innate about them (""being black, for example), rather than as a result of the disadvantaged circumstances of their brith. What's more likely: All of these people are all just *really* fucking stupid, or they simply lack the opportunity/encouragement to develop critical thinking skills? Personally, I'd bet on the latter. Given how frustrating the political climate has been lately, it's really tempting to just be like ""Nah, fuck all those people"" but I just don't see how anything productive can come from this point of view, and, frankly, I think it actually misses the point entirely.Sorry, I didn't mean to ramble on about this so much, but I've been thinking a lot about this lately given the pretty terrifying world we've found ourselves in since Election Day.

Lonestar15,"There is a project outside of Houston that is trying out clean coal. The idea is to use a carbon capture technique to keep emissions from coal power plant. From there they put the co2 in a pipeline and send it to an oil field where it is used for secondary recovery by pumping it down the well to make the hydrocarbons less viscous? So they can extract it easier. They also have a carbon capture machine(or whatever it is called) at the we'll to capture any Co2 that escapes. Not sure what they do with the co2 after they use it for secondary recovery though, still pretty interesting. I'm also not sure how effective the ""capturing method"" is. I don't have a source since I'm on my phone but if you google ""Houston carbon capture power plan"" I bet it will come upEdit: here's a source.

In the same way, the content related to the Obama administration on WhiteHouse.gov was migrated to a new web site, ObamaWhiteHouse.Archives.gov:- From Snopes: http://www.snopes.com/white-house-web-site-trump-changes/",4.1411372e-16,7.878694e-32,5.6686695e-12,7.481219e-19,5.962868e-14,1.8244294e-18

xRehab,"Or it could be as simple as a makeover and the current POTUS, along with his advisors, decided leaving up the old president's values/beliefs/vision is not what they want people seeing when they first land on the White House website. **If Sanders becomes president in 4 years, do you think his team will leave Trump's old pages up on the site or will they be pulled down immediately like what we just saw? Do you think they can reasonably have a new page in production before he is actually sworn in that could go live at a moment's notice?** Or is it more likely they have a general page and talking points setup, but have to run everything through all the hoops and check every box before it goes live since this is arguably the ""biggest"" government website the US has?Ignore what those old views were or what the suggested new views may be for right now; look at it as new management is taking over. In any normal position, new leadership typically does gut the old and bring in a revised version of things - even if your revised version is essentially the same as the old, it is better to have a fresh ""new"" version of it that is attached to you. Again, we don't know what it will be replaced with or if it will even be replaced on the site, but don't jump to conclusions assuming the worst. While a lot of the suggested outcomes that are being posted here are very probable, a lot of them are worrying about things that go way above and beyond what is reasonably going to happen.I'll end this with what I explained in a lecture yesterday; Trump ran his campaign as the antonym of Hillary's. His entire campaign was built on ideas and dreams which is what won people over, but he didn't have any plan for how to achieve those dreams. Without a thorough plan crafted well in advance, the reality of his decisions and actions will fall well short of his goals. He may call for a wall and in the end only receive some extra funding and more boots on the ground; he may have called for the repeal of the ACA but will only end up gutting a fraction of it and slapping a new GOP title onto it while touting how great their new plan is in comparison to the ACA.

If the administration uses laws to enforce certain beliefs onto people, then the people will vote appropriately, or so the idea goes. The idea that allowing for discrimination based on race is a necessary evil is abhorrent. All people give up some amount of freedom to participate in society. That's the whole concept.

NAN,">What happens when the only grocery store for miles in a small town decided to refuse to sell anything to a Muslim family? The only doctor nearby refusing to see Asian patients, of which there are only a few in the area?I really find it hard to take this type of thing seriously. It's a very absurd hypothetical that I'm not convinced would ever happen. Will there be a Muslim living in a tiny town in the deep south with only one store and that store owner happened to be so much of a bigot etc. ehhh, It's a real stretch. I wouldn't want to see that happen, but we live in a very connected time. When something happens in a remote part of the country the entire world can know about it in a few moments. So, the backlash doesn't just have to come from that town, it can be from anywhere. >And if something is legal, it must be acceptableThere is a very large number of things that are legal, but are definitely not acceptable. There's a lot of crazy examples that can surely be made here.>Trump is still limited by the ConstitutionEspecially because of it's focus on freedom and individual rights. >The idea that allowing for discrimination based on race is a necessary evil is abhorrent.Well I happen to think that giving some people more freedom on the basis or race or religion, etc. than others is abhorrent.",8.5569376e-14,5.8754297e-29,7.2569555e-11,1.0164017e-17,3.0033395e-13,1.3226121e-17
HollrHollrGetCholera,"As far as hypothetical go, it's hardly ridiculous. All you need is a refugee family being settled in a place that previously lacked that kind of group. How about a gay teen living in a small town? And again, the people who would be outraged by this sort of thing are not the [people who would have any affect on the town. No one likes bad press, but it would be forgotten about in a few weeks by the vast majority of people. Backlash requires actual consequence, which i do not believe the internet age adequately provides without legal backing. I'm saying how society generally sees acceptability. Obviously, since people seek to change laws constantly, that many view certain laws and norms unacceptable. But it is far easier to support a position if the government has it as legal. It is both the focus on individual rights as well as the division of powers within the federal, state and local levels that restrict trump's power. The President is not that powerful of a position, it just gives you the most name recognition and air time. You don't get more freedom than others based on race and religion. You have the exact same freedoms. Your race, any race, is a protected class. As is you religious beliefs, and you gender, and your ethnicity.

Sanpaku,"No, there's too much inertia in the Earth system for the full impacts to be felt in 100 years, and there isn't enough carbon in remaining fossil fuels and reservoirs like rainforests, peat, permafrost and seabed clathrates for a Venus-like runaway. However, over the next couple centuries a repeat of the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum 56 million years ago, when mean temperatures rose 5+° C (about twice that on land) is very plausible. Even in PETM like conditions, there would be places suitable for agriculture, but they could only support a small fraction of the present, much less projected, global population.The major primary impacts we'll see over this century are heat waves, more frequent droughts, more frequent destructive storms, and crop losses, as some of our stable crops are highly susceptible to heat stress, and many of the world's breadbaskets will dry out with latitudinal expansion of the subtropical desert belts. A rule of thumb that's emerged from several studies is every 1° C means an average loss of 10% in crop yields. This means more failed states, conflict, and refugee crises, which as the last election suggests will fuel fascist politics in the developed world.Over the next century, we'll have around 1-2 m of sea-level rise, and many low-lying areas will either erect defenses or be abandoned to the sea. There are no defenses against the 30 m (or so) expected this millenium as Antarctica and Greenland melt, or the 60 m possible over the next few millenia. There are also no defenses against the combination of high summer temperatures and humidity which will make some places lethal to humans outdoors (around the Persian Gulf later this century, but including much of the US midwest in the full 6°+ C scenario.There is a possible worst case scenario playing out over the next millenium, in which the oceans become thermally stratified, and the chemocline above anoxic bottom waters rises towards the surface (photic zone anoxia/euxinia), permitting the proliferation of green and purple sulfur reducing bacteria and burps of noxious hydrogen sulfide to the atmosphere, which doesn't just smell of rotten eggs and kill directly, but also destroys the ozone layer.

""[I'll know it when I see it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it)""-------Trump is a fascist. He went around the country blaming [Mexicans for stealing our jobs](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/07/12/donald_trump_in_phoenix_mexicans_are_taking_our_jobs_and_killing_us.html), [Blacks for causing all the crime](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/23/donald-trump/trump-tweet-blacks-white-homicide-victims/), [Muslims for making us feel vulnerable](http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/07/politics/donald-trump-muslim-ban-immigration/), and the [jews for keeping us controlling ourselves](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/anti-semitism-is-no-longer-an-undertone-of-trumps-campaign-its-the-melody/2016/11/07/b1ad6e22-a50a-11e6-8042-f4d111c862d1_story.html?utm_term=.30ef7ed03126).He said multiple times, and his followers believe, [only **he** can fix the problems](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/07/21/donald-trump-republican-convention-acceptance-speech/87385658/). That [we need a strong man](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/2016-donald-trump-latin-america-twitter-213759) who doesn't bend to the will of the people or morality. Ends justifying the means.This strongman populism, with racial nationalism, is the stuff of Hitler.I've heard it from his supporters, we shouldn't read too much into his positions. He doesn't really mean it. Here's an article from [1922 NYT about Hitler claiming the exact same thing](https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2015/02/10/1922-hitler-in-bavaria/). >But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed the idea that Hitler's anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic, and in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.So do I think it's apt to compare trump to 1940's Hitler? No. I think I can compare him to 1930's Hitler. When he started to take power at the state level.So going back to my list. He is a white nationalist strongman who [believes in eugenics](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-president-superior-genes-pbs-documentary-eugenics-a7338821.html).

He has rallied a large portion of america in supporting those types of positions through fear and hate. [His attacks on the media mirror that of Hitler's](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/24/the-ugly-history-of-luegenpresse-a-nazi-slur-shouted-at-a-trump-rally/?utm_term=.b81ff7fe49d9).This is how 1930's Hitler acted. I can tell you these tactics are working. My mom is a Trump voter. Her racism and hate has increased over the past few years. She's said the only reason Muslims have children is to take over our democracy. She hated Bill Clinton for cheating, voted enthusiastically for Trump. That we should keep immigrants out so we don't change our ""culture"". That we [need a Strong president to Make the change happen](https://youtu.be/WNSq5wYdwb0?t=43s).

jcargile242,"From the [whitehouse.gov page on DT's ""energy plan""] (https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy): >Energy is an essential part of American life and a staple of the world economy. The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil. You know what else would do that? Continuing progress on *clean energy* and working to make oil obsolete. >For too long, we've been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years. Those ""burdensome regulations"" are there to protect public health and save lives. Eliminating these ""harmful policies"" will cause unimaginable harm to our people and planet. >Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America. The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well. Yes, let's get busy fracking all over the place. Nevermind all those earthquakes! >The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America's coal industry, which has been hurting for too long. COAL ISN'T COMING BACK THIS IS A LIE LIE LIE. >In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America's national security interest. President Trump is committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests. At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy. We can boost domestic energy production AND move away from oil at the same time. In a few years China will be leading the clean energy revolution, making massive profits selling their technology around the globe, while we're sitting here in the old USofA, finding new and better ways to suck dead dinosaur juice out of the ground while more and more people are dying from cancer. >Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water. BWAHAHAHAHA OMG WTF all of THAT above talking about scrapping regulations which aim to improve our air and water quality and then THIS? **REFOCUS THE EPA???** FFS, how? By putting in charge a bought-and-paid-for shill for the fossil fuel industry? A man who only recently grudgingly stated that he kinda thinks climate change might be a thing maybe but he's not even sure if humans really have much to do with it. A man who as Oklahoma AG, has sued the EPA repeatedly over, among other things, laws requiring lower mercury emissions from power plants. Seriously? >A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration's energy policies, that future can become a reality. These policies will do none of the above. Our economy will stagnate and fall behind as the rest of the world gets over its addiction to oil. Our security will suffer as climate change accelerates - our own military has said as much.

You have much more power over controlling price when the supply is limited. In turn greater margins. Renewable energy lacks the ability to imply scarcity and thusly you cannot manipulate price as easily.This will change. Eventually energy will be so abundant that it won't be a sector of extreme profit. Sadly American business people want to milk every dollar of dirty energy they can before it's exhausted.

Currently, the term clean coal is used in the coal industry primarily in reference to carbon capture and storage, which pumps and stores CO2 emissions underground. Plants using integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) involve coal gasification, which provides a basis for increased efficiency and lower cost in capturing CO2 emissions.

Where scientist work with groups like the internet archive to backup data according to data preservation standards. Some of the data is going to the internet archive. Others will go onto servers owned by amazon. The Philadelphia event itself cost 22,000 dollars. Other events will be held in Toronto, Chicago, Han Aber, Los Angeles, and New York. The point of all these events is to backup data into places not controlled by the government.They have a automatic system for going through basic website interfaces. Internet archives go through a website, and click on every link. However, more advanced systems are needed for things like popup windows and search boxes. Some of the he files are preserved in what is called a warc file.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_ARChive. This is only for sites that can be automatically crawl through.

Because of the bad education system, although we have people with engineering degrees, they aren't truly capable of achieving engineering success in the world wide space. This is why a majority of Indian engineers working in India are actually support engineers working under a different title because of their degree. This is why Indian engineers are competitive in the support space but not so much in the actual engineering space. Any Indian who rises above this keeps moving abroad to innovate leaving the support people behind. This is causing a massive brain drain in the country where the best and brightest move away seeking greener pastures. The western education systems are far more advanced and practically oriented. So if an American educated engineer comes to India, you can bet he will be better than almost every Indian engineer at the same experience level. You will have to fight the idiotic cultural office politics but this is rapidly changing and, if you don't mind living in a 3rd world country, you can achieve great success in India career wise.

Hell, if I hadn't have bought the property we're in for the absolute steal we got it for I couldn't even afford to rent where I am today. And that's with dual professional incomes. So that means I get to commute.Most of the Bay is not HOA and gated communities. Sure there are plenty of them here but there is a whole lot of normal, old housing as well.

For those that happen to live and work where it services. Sure, I could take the bus to BART, BART to south SF, and then CalTrain down to my job. If I didn't mind it taking 3 hours each way. I tried it for a week. Spending 1/4 of my existence on public transit is not cool.You are right that the infrastructure sucks. But that isn't going to change any time soon. Not even if you threw billions at it. Why? Because between eminent domain battles (there's no place to build new corridors even if we had the money) and endless environmental impact studies it just can't happen. I would be the first to volunteer for higher taxes if it meant another mid-bay bridge with BART tubes. We need that, a doubling of tracks, dozens of new stations, quadrupling of cars, bringing BART down into south Milpitas and south Mountain View, connecting the 237 loop, and seemless integration with both VTA and CalTrain before public transit became a viable enough option to make a difference around here. Short of that then coordinated, driverless, electric cars are really the only viable solution here. It's individualized mass transit.

They aren't a sole factor that will alter the global landscape, but it's a sizable step.

There are a finite number of things we can competitively sell to other people (mostly high technology items and industries), and we're giving up one of the big pillars of that going forward in this century.I don't understand this argument.Quite a few of the market leaders in green energy production today are American corporations, and they will continue to be American corporations regardless of who the president is. That technology will still be researched, developed, and exported by those companies, and the fruits of that will still be coming back to them. I don't see a reason to believe that American companies will not be benefitting from green energy/research when they are consistently among the global leaders in said research (and production in the case of who manufactures and engineers the turbines, solar panels, etc).

NisslMissl,"Fertile ground is not solely based on temperature. The majority of land area at higher latitudes is in Russia, so I'll focus on that for now.Almost a quarter of the land area in Russia is currently covered in peat lands, which are low in nutrients and not really useful soil for a lot of agricultural plants. On top of that though, they are really good carbon sinks. Peat land conversion in Malaysia (which is a different order of magnitude than what would be required for Russia) for example produces 60 tons of CO2 per hectare per year for 25 years. Then you have the boreal forests, which again, cover massive areas. These again, are nutrient poor and surprisingly again carbon sinks. On top of that, they are generally found in areas with low precipitation. Perfect for agriculture.So on top of the already catastrophic emissions that we are pretty much guaranteed from the melting of permafrost and those released in the east Siberian arctic shelf, the only way to actually farm the areas ""gained"" would be to convert peat lands and through massive deforestation, producing even more emissions. Now though, you've only got the land clear for agricultural use, you have yet to actually farm anything. Because of the nutrient poor soil you need fertilizers. The production of chemical fertilizers currently accounts for ~2% of global energy usage and uses natural gas as a hydrogen source for nitrogen fertilizer. I suppose one could potentially use water for the hydrogen, but I think one would be somewhat strapped for that, wanting to irrigate massive fields of crops in an area of low precipitation. Then we have the problem of sunlight and while there are more hours of sunlight per day at higher latitudes, the angle means that the sunlight hitting a certain area will actually provide less energy than nearer the equator. Maybe the extended hours cancel that out again, but I'd be rather surprised by that. Add to that the problems with infrastructure in areas where the ground freezes solid in winter due to the massive seasonal temperature range of such a continental climate and you're generally left with a situation that I would describe as less than ideal.

I believe pretty much everything you say regarding agricultural problems from global warming, you seem very educated on this matter. I do believe in human caused climate change, I've studied thermodynamics and the emission/absorption spectrum of gaseous CO2 is not something that eludes my understanding. The U.S after global warming compared to the U.S before will be weaker, BUT (only caps cause main point) THE US WILL BECOME COMPARATIVELY MORE POWERFUL AFTER GLOBAL WARMING THAN BEFORE. Millions of people in the third world will die, maybe only a few hundred thousand Americans will starve (high estimate imo).

First, congress is mostly Christian because America is mostly Christian. Second, when an atheist or a scientologist isn't elected, it isn't because voters vote with their faith. I'm telling you this as someone with a graduate degree in political psychology. Third, being Christian (or a member of *any* faith) does *not* mean that one's faith is the only consideration one has. It does not follow that a Congress full of Christians will create a Christian Theocracy. For a real world example of that--look around you: do we have a Christian Theocracy? Are you required to worship Jesus? Are you required to go to church? Are you banned from getting a divorce? Do you go to jail for cheating on your spouse? Are you required to observe *any* religious law?

esantipapa,">Which review them for writing style, not scientific merit. Publishers do review for literary merit, and often decide not to publish terrible works. But that's not the same I suppose.I mean the circumstances that make you YOU are arbitrary. Most religious beliefs are a reflection of pretty basic circumstances... where a person was born or whom their parents are, what their parents believe. And these arbitrary circumstances you appreciate apparently. That's cool. >If I can't get a solid answer regarding fundamental questions about our existence, I can't just somehow make those questions not relevant to my life. Is it so hard to accept that ultimately you really don't matter and you have no purpose other than that you choose? Do you really need to conjure up a creator of the universe to find meaning in your existence? (if that's what you do) Does that level of self-centeredness never dawn on you (if not for yourself, but for others)? The most powerful being in the universe not only exists, but it cares about *every* decision you make. (broadly speaking, that mindset applies to a lot of religions, if not yours... cool)The qualifier you desire is one you had already agreed to, e.g. when their faith informs/controls/guides/writes policy decisions. In good conscience, when someone explains they will govern guided by faith (see recent Presidential Republican Primary for prime examples), shouldn't that scare folks? I would hope their faith is the last thing on their mind when making policy decisions that happen to decide whether people will live or die, especially when those people may not believe in an afterlife whatsoever?I took the oath of service in the military, it does contain [the ""So Help me god"" portion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_help_me_God#United_States), but it is now optional...

I wanted to look into all the rituals we have in daily life that are bizarre, unspoken, and yet followed religiously.

creedofwheat,"I think it's an organized and purposeful shift of focus. I assume the justification would be that he doesn't need to defend it or provide references when there is ""no definite proof"" of it. It'd essentially be one of those things that can only change with a new administration or pushing for compromise with his policies. Which sucks cause #science, yo.I honestly couldn't tell you if he truly doesn't believe in climate change or just said that for garnering votes (likely the former though). Nonetheless, He emphasizes the job creation (bringing back old jobs with it) it will provide. I also believe he wants to work on clean energy and water technology development at the same time for business purposes.Plus his focus is cleaning our own environment, not the world's (and yes, it's redundant based on coal/fracking). He's taking the stance that no matter what initiatives we put in place, countries like China will still contribute to climate change... Why put money in to keep the neighborhood's grass green when they don't even mow it? So we might as well focus on our own backyard. Plus the tariffs he puts in place would promote manufacturing jobs to return to the US, which has stricter environmental guidelines. So technically he can say his initiatives actually helped fight climate change... and you can sure as bet he will say it around 2-3 years from now.I pretty much don't think he cares whether or not climate change is real or not. It's a political move, as the worse thing that can happen is things will remain the same. The best thing to happen is the development of clean energy that provides a not addition of jobs when we no longer rely on coal, etc.If my interpretation's right then it makes sense... but I don't agree with it. Yet it's also just an interpretation... so I could be wrong. If I'm right then the goal would be develop the clean energy as fast as possible rather then let any potential progress stall and fester with red tap.It would be easier if he believed in impact of climate change, though.",4.9632764e-15,2.6429987e-34,5.0513433e-14,1.4184996e-19,2.805115e-15,4.684575e-19

xahnel,"No, no. You aren't quite understanding. This wasn't a degree Celsius. This was a fraction of a degree celsius. It was a degree in Fahrenheit.And according to climate projections, we'll have passed that two degree threshold anyways (if current trends continue) before the proposed plan would have ever had an effect. So, if the plan is essentially projected to fail, the fuck is the point of trying to impose it on people?Simple: you're being played. The government has never cared. The UN certainly doesn't care. They are using your fears and concerns to enrich themselves, give themselves more power and control, now, and fuck the future, because by then, they'll be dead. A good example of this is treating CO^2 as a pollutant. Literally every member of the animal kingdom exhales the shit. You don't realize how much power it gives a government to label your breath a pollutant. Once you personally are a polluter, you can be subjected to pollution regulation. And the worst part is that studies done on plant life suggests that plants are actually starved for CO^2. That a doubling or tripling of the PPM (which, at last googling, was somewhere in the 200 PPM range) would allow for hardier, faster growing plants that require less sun and water. Some greenhouses artificially increase the amount of CO^2 to get more out of their plants. This isn't a pollutant, this is the oxygen of plants, but we're striving to reduce the amount in the air constantly. This makes plants weaker. It makes them guzzle more water, need more time in the sun, makes them weaker to disease.And you can't rely on government subsidies for research (at least, not the ones that go to companies). Look at the most famous example, Solyndra. Obama pumped quite a lot of taxpayer cash into the company, only for it to fold like Vegas tourist with a pair of twos. I'd much rather that money go to university or military research into the problem. Better chances of success that way.

Albeit, the issue seems pretty debatable to me. No one has ever just, boom, hit me with the facts. For people that are all about arguing facts rather than ""the deniers are incompetent,"" they sure seem to despise providing the actual evidence. If I had to wager a guess, if they provided evidence, the climate would deteriorate and that is why they are so utterly opposed to it. I have only ever had one person link me to the whitehouse.gov page. Never got around to reading it; however, that is somewhat impossible currently.So... we are just going to be in this constant state of ""climate change is detrimental because muh scientists."" Here is the issue, I do not consider myself a climate change denier because I am not even afforded the luxury of these facts to deny them in the first place. Apparently I am chasing ""rose-tinted visions of a past that never was"" because I have never read the whitehouse.gov page and do not take the x amount of scientists as seriously as I take the 3 in 4 dentists recommend this toothpaste. As I always ask (and never receive, which, as you can imagine, has helped cement my perspective on this matter), care to provide the facts so that you can put me in my place and I do not have to ask another idiot that parrots scientific hearsay?

To dismiss all of them because you think you know better is immensely arrogant.Hindsight is 20/20 and I'll give you that Bernie Sanders probably would have won the general if he'd won the primary. Not necessarily because he was the better candidate, but because of several of the Clinton campaign's optimistic assumptions that ended up being false, such as* Republicans would find Donald Trump so unpalatable that they would vote 3rd party or stay home. Instead, 91% of self-described Republicans voted for him.* Women would be eager for a woman president especially when faced with a candidate who bragged about sexual assault. Instead Republican women voted for Trump at the same rate as Republican men, around 91%.* Democratic fear of Trump combined with a strong get-out-the-vote operation would produce strong Democratic turnout. It was infact 7 points below Republicans, at 84%.[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-exit-polls-how-donald-trump-won-the-us-presidency/]Personally, I assumed that voters would find Bernie Sanders too radical and too closely associated with communism to vote for him.

I don't care about the progressive agenda outside of everyone should have exactly the same rights and redoing drug policy. I don't need a politician to wade neck deep into racial, social, and cultural bogs when the people whom it involves most won't do that. I want the 1st amendment reaffirmed both in reduction of grovelling to special interests as well as governmental overreach (i.e. Manning and Snowden) I want the 2nd amendment left alone (although I am in favor of mandatory safety training before someone can purchase a gun.) I want the 4th amendment significantly strengthened, particularly digital issues. If a candidate can't speak to a majority of those issue, then I'm more concerned with attempting to give the other parties a voice rather than bowing down to the dem establishment. I'd much rather keep taking 3 steps back until we can't step back any further and must move forward as a party than I am in constantly taking 1 step back in perpetuity like the dem establishment would have us do. For my lifetime, the politics of the party have been to only be marginally better for the middle class than the repubs. I'm sick of it.

And either through hubris, naivete, or ignorance, the democratic party got the country stolen from underneath them. School boards, regulatory boards, city/town councils, state govt, both houses of Congress and now the Presidency. None of that happens without the Tea Party. So I think the Bernie dems are going to follow that playbook going forward until the establishment can't take the losing anymore. If the Dems want to represent us, then we are going to make motherfucking sure they do. And if they don't want to play with us, then they can keep losing.

Jedi_Ewok,"Why is just as important to understand and consider as what and how. I mean in a practical sense you just pick which side is voting the policies you most like, but it's important to know their motivations to help predict long term repercussions and know if you truly agree with those policies. For example, people bought in wholeheartedly to the Patriot Act because they thought it would protect them when it was just about expanding government powers and everyone in congress knew it. People heard the politicians saying their reason was to protect them but wouldn't spend 2 seconds looking for their true motivations. If they had they wouldn't have supported it so fervently. There are thousands of examples where knowing a politician's true motivations behind policy will affect your opinion of it. Now this doesn't necessarily apply so much to climate change specifically as that is really a scientific issue that has been unfortunately caught up in politics. The Republicans just use it as a way to divide the country and secure a voting block, in this case stupid people, so it's kind of different but it's true for most issues.

Oreganoian,This has been disproven. https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-other-planets-solar-system-intermediate.htm>There are three fundamental flaws in the 'other planets are warming' argument. Not all planets in the solar system are warming. The sun has shown no long term trend since 1950 and in fact has shown a slight cooling trend in recent decades. There are explanations for why other planets are warming.,7.492915e-15,1.833939e-34,1.4535838e-13,5.123491e-20,2.3808325e-16,1.7855194e-20
lookatmeimwhite,"It has absolutely not been disproven. If anything, the source you provided shows that.Here is the first two sentences from Gierasch, regarding Jupiter:> ""The energy source driving Jupiter's active meteorology is not understood. There are two main candidates: a poorly understood internal heat source and sunlight.""The source you posted has this to say about Pluto:> Pluto's warming is not clearly understood.Someone in the comment section had a good point, as well:> You realize that the argument, Jupiter is heated from within and only receives a small fraction of the energy from the sun that the Earth does, depends upon that 4% of energy being incapable of driving weather. We know this to be false from your own report regarding Neptune.While Jupiter receives 25 times less energy per square meter from the sun that the Earth does, Neptune receives 900 times less.> How is it that the 900 times weaker sunshine can drive weather and promote seasonal changes on Neptune, as you testify on this very blog above, but the much stronger incident sunshine on the face of Jupiter is considered inconsequential?> The fact is Jupiter is a strong case for solar driven climate change. The Great Red Spot is a singular weather event without a peer or analog on any of the other known worlds. Some people insist on describing it as a hurricane. This is incorrect. A hurricane is a low pressure zone funneling surrounding warm air to the ground. The Great Red Spot is a high pressure zone, forcing hot air out of the middle of the planet. It rises 8 kilometers above the surrounding methane cloud deck, like a turkey timer that is popping out to tell us that the thanksgiving meal is ready.And now we have another great red spot, which will probably be with us for a very very long time.>Neptune is changing in a spectacular and miraculous way which a cut and dried pdf file will not impart to you.>[Have a look at it in color](http://hubblesite.org/image/1354/news_release/2003-17). Neptune's orbit is 164 years long, and Voyager only visited it once back in 1989, so we have no baseline to judge if this change is the natural effect of Neptune traveling through it's orbit, or if it is the result of an augmented solar effect.> But either way it is the sun driving Neptune's weather.> Voyager was launched in 1977 and didn't get to Neptune until 1989. Right now, thirty years later, Voyager still has ten more years of travel before it reachs the heliopause, where the solar wind gives way to the pressure of interstellar space. So don't let this joker fool you that the sun is too weak or feeble to affect JupiterFinally, let's look at Uranus.> Uranus has just passed into the equinox of its orbit where the whole of the planet is receiving sunshine evenly, as opposed to just the one pole getting continuous sunlight.

But I'd ask, first, are you in one of the 19 states where Republicans blocked expanding Medicare? And then there's Congress's efforts to block Obamacare from being able to ""bail out"" insurance companies losses if they took on more sick people.> In states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults fall into a “coverage gap” of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits. http://kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/the-coverage-gap-uninsured-poor-adults-in-states-that-do-not-expand-medicaid/Sorry I missed the ""intra.""

So Obama was expected to break an international deal and occupy a sovereign nation? >Condoleezza Rice, who served as Bush's secretary of state, wrote in her 2011 book, “No Higher Honor,” that Bush did not want to set a deadline “in order to allow conditions on the ground to dictate our decisions.” She wrote that she met with Maliki in August 2008 and secured what she thought was an agreement for a residual force of 40,000 U.S. troops. But she said Maliki soon “reneged” and insisted on “the withdrawal of all U.S. forces by the end of 2011.” She said Bush “swallowed hard” and agreed to what she called “suitable language” to do just that.",4.6350016e-14,1.4376783e-30,2.9025716e-12,1.1490001e-17,1.12348885e-13,2.1314052e-17

When obamacare was implemented, my rates tripled and since i make too much money to qualify for any government programs, i'm straight up SOL. I'm *literally* being taxed for what i can't afford and i will blame obama for that until i can get past it. Until then, raising my taxes to pay for other people's insurance plans isnt going to help me out any today, and when i loose my house, it'll be one less person paying into the socialistic redistribution programs and one more person hanging onto them. Yes, increasing the range so that more people can get aid is nice in theory, but then your just passing the buck onto others who have their lives together and cause them the same duress. These people have the ability to leave the country and good luck trying to tax people who neither live nor work here.Was it fake sensational news when obama said the police acted stupidly when they arrested his professor? was it fake sensational news when obama said that trevon couldn't be guilty? the list goes on and on and caused a divide between those who believe they are oppressed by the police (whether they are or not is a different conversation and requires and entirely different method than the one chosen to weed it out) and the ones who believe the police dont blindly kill whoever they come across. i could easily site articles where more white men are shot and killed by police than blacks by percent and show other proof that more black people kill black people, but whats the point? your right about my poor phrasing, but its still accurate to say that man, in his course to protect and save, has done considerable damage. for example, by blindly putting out forest fires in the west of the united states, we have allowed the underbrush to build to the point that fires burn hotter and longer than they should. while they would normally have mostly burned through the forests quickly leaving the trees able to heal, our attempt at putting out fires as if all fire was pure evil and must be extinguished has brought us to the point that any fire must actually be extinguished because the trees can no longer survive it. again, there are other examples but this is getting quite lengthy and i dont wish to continue.you believe Condoleezza Rice? the same person who allowed herself to believe that civil protesters would naturally carry RPGs, rockets, motors, and enough weapons to take over a government compound over an internet video with 0 views 2 days before the attacks because it wasnt even posted yet and when it was posted, it was posted by a US government sponsored body? There were several other agencies that pulled out of that country the week before because it was getting dicey and it was all hidden from the american people. More to the point, no we did not fully pull out of iraq as is proof by berry's own platform when he was running for president that he would get us out of both wars in the middle east, so yes i do blame him for not listening to the military advisers.",1.5574286e-13,8.308652e-24,1.3707616e-08,1.14818696e-14,4.118113e-09,4.4243526e-14

That's fake news.> We'll note that taxes have gone up for some as a result of Obamacare. The law imposes a 3.8 percent tax on net investment income that applies to people who earn more than $200,000 a year for singles, or $250,000 for joint filers. It also levies an additional Medicare tax of 0.9 percent on wages, salaries and self-employment income for people in those income groups.http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/false-tax-claims/Next, Obama apologized for the ""acted stupidly"" remark. You can't tell me Trump hasn't said anything he needs to apologize for.

But not when accounting for the number of blacks in the US versus whites. Although, we do need to factor in systemic racism and poverty. No one can dispute that poverty isn't a contributing factor to crime.As for forest fires, I agree with you totally. We need controlled burns to stop the fuel build up. My area just dealt with devastating fires, some started by kids. But is this Obama's fault or Congress's? > The National Cohesive Wildland Fire Management Strategy, as the Obama plan is called, seeks to provide funding to help protect 46 million homes in 70,000 communities at risk from wildfire. The strategy specifically calls out the importance of restoration and mitigation, and it clearly acknowledges climate change as a critical factor.> The proposal is facing fierce opposition. Rep. Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, has been a particularly outspoken critic of the administration's intention to downplay firefighting in favor of forest management and fire prevention. He and some other politicians from the West want to keep all-out firefighting as the top priority – harking back to the 1930s, when the Forest Service's so-called ""10 am policy"" promised to extinguish new fires by the next morning. http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/america-is-burning-the-fight-against-wildfires-gets-real-20140723""you believe Condoleezza Rice?""I don't have to:>It is true that Bush signed an agreement, known as the Status of Forces Agreement, on Dec. 14, 2008, that said: “All the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.” http://www.factcheck.org/2015/08/bush-clinton-play-blame-game-in-iraq/https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/12/20081214-2.html",1.7452139e-15,1.7476846e-31,1.458498e-11,1.4466379e-18,3.607334e-14,4.6959e-19

morphinedreams,"[Neo-liberalism is just a name for the economic policies that sprung up around the 80's that promoted completely free-market capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism). If there was a problem, the market would fix it. If the market wouldn't fix it, there was no problem. Examples include enormous tax breaks for the upper tax brackets, using the claim that it promotes economic growth, and ""cutting red tape"" that make starting businesses or developing new products difficult. This was given the name trickle down economics, and has largely been discredited as not promoting significant growth either in GDP or jobs. Generally, the democratic party has bucked the trend against neo-liberalism. Promoting regulatory roles that inhibit free market capitalism from externalising costs of doing business. Reagan's administration was one of the major influences in neoliberal policy, and indeed his system was commonly called [""reaganomics""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics).Hillary was a bit of a washington hawk regarding her foreign policy, but she didn't actually have a lot in common with the people pushing neo-liberal policy other than being a wealthy politician. Trump's businesses have benefited considerably from tax breaks and lack of regulation (see Trump University for example). He is likely to repeal a lot of regulation, [such as the Dodd-Frank act](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-09/victorious-donald-trump-is-the-devil-wall-street-doesn-t-know) that contributed to reigning Wall-Street in after the GFC, [while his congress wants to dismantle the endangered species act](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/republicans-are-trying-their-damnedest-to-dismantle-the-endangered-species-act), his pick for secretary of education [wants to promote charter schools (private) options over public](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/01/what-new-orleans-can-teach-betsy-devos-about-charter-schools-214610).

morphinedreams,">With that definition I understand why... I was told that super left wingers are neo-liberals.Nope, neoliberalism is probably most close to libertarianism, which usually associates itself with the political right in the US.[Neo-conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoconservatism) may be what you were looking for.>Neoconservatives typically advocate the promotion of democracy and promotion of American national interest in international affairs, including by means of military force and are known for espousing disdain for communism and for political radicalism.You could make the argument that Hillary is a neo-conservative, but I wouldn't since she is mostly just tough on foreign policy. You may also be able to make the same argument about Trump, but it's difficult since we only have his bravado and campaign statements to go by. Bombing ISIS round the clock and taking their oil is a *very* neo-conservative thing to say. On the other hand abandoning NATO is pretty anti-neo-conservative. Some of his appointments would be considered neo-conservatives though. He's using [Cheney as an advisor](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/dick-cheney-trump-surrogate-232746), as is Rex Tillerson, Michael Flynn could be called neo-conservative quite easily.

Innovative_Wombat,"> Droughts and fires and floods are natural events. How do we wage war on them?Fires for one, particularly large forest fires can be reduced by allowing the forests to return to their regular burn cycle. We've been extremely good at shutting down fires but in the process allowed massively dense forests to occur with huge amounts of tinder all in the name of protecting outlying development. Hence why our forest fires in the past 20 years have been longer, bigger and hotter than forest fires in the past when we just let them burn. This is basic knowledge which suggests you aren't even remotely educated at even a community college level. Droughts can be mitigated by reducing population growth in areas prone to them, as well as water conservation practices. We can also slow down the change in climate that is making wetter places wetter and drier places drier. Floods can be mitigated as well by limiting population growth in flood bound areas, building infrastructure to handle large influxes of water in short periods of time, managing natural growth areas to raise absorption of water before it hits rivers and floodplains as well as slowing down the change in climate that is making wetter places wetter and drier places drier.",1.9337074e-15,1.6412897e-32,1.998448e-12,1.54046e-19,2.0005694e-15,1.2517928e-19

Sonic527,"Alright so I looked through the articles and this is what I have to say about each one.In the first article it says blatantly.“The scientific consensus might, of course, be wrong. If the history of science teaches anything, it is humility, and no one can be faulted for failing to act on what is not known. But our grandchildren will surely blame us if they find that we understood the reality of anthropogenic climate change and failed to do anything about it. “And the chart provided also seems incorrect, well hear me out anyway. It goes to 1916 – 2016. and there is warming, but the ice age which was about 110,000 years ago is clearly not shown on this graph. Wouldn't the blue lines be off the graph during this time? Couldn't it be argued the Earth has been warming since the time when there were few humans and no factories meaning humans could not effect this change and warming is a natural thing? Pretty sure during the time of dinosaurs the Earth was a very warm and tropical place so maybe it's returning to it's natural temperture.The second article“According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C. Our model does not have the extreme sensitivity of atmospheric temperature to changes of CO2 content which was adduced”As it says in the abstract it's an estimate and the model does not have a working atmosphere like Earth so pretty much bogus. I grant you there's a lot of graphs and equations in the article but doesn't really mean much if it's not even using all the factors of the experiment.The final articleGonna be honest, not sure what this paper is trying to say. I believe it's about species evolution due to climate change which makes sense, animals evolve in order to survive... so if climate change is real and we're evolving to survive, nature is taking it's course and allowing us to evolve the earth warmng so why are we trying to stop the earth from warming??That's what I have to say for those articles so I guess I'll take more if you got them :)",1.4076893e-11,2.2158973e-24,1.4442679e-09,9.929592e-14,7.1105766e-09,1.1468333e-12
Beatminerz,"If you're not going to accept any climate science until they have a fully functioning experimental Earth's atmosphere then you're not going to accept climate science. As for the last paper, it's less relevant and a little confusing but I take it you only read the abstracts. I appreciate you at least opening the links I provided,though as I said before, if you're unwilling to accept the science there's nothing else I can do. If you really want more sources just go to Google Scholar and search ""climate change"" or ""warming theories"" or something of the sort. I must say, if you are waiting for these to become 100% facts before you decide to accept the science, our planet will already be ruined. Science doesn't work that way, it's a dynamic process that builds on itself. Chemistry, for example, is an extremely well-established field of science, based very much on the study of the electron, yet no one knows what the physical structure of an electron even is! Pysicists worked for decades under the assumption of the existence of a gravity field, even though gravity waves had never been detected(until very recently). Science is hypothesis driven by nature, and although you're absolutely correct in saying that the hypothesis of greater than 99% of scientists might still be incorrect, I haven't seen a single alternative hypothesis for global warming aside from ""oh well, it's just a cycle things heat up things cool down"". You may deny their conclusions, but you can't deny the raw data. Our planet is heating up drastically. CO2 levels have increased drastically. CO2 is very good at absorbing/scattering thermal radiation. It doesn't take a scientist to put those pieces together BTW I apologize for being a dick to you earlier, it wasn't necessary and it doesn't help get my point across. I just feel very strongly about this issue and wish people didn't have this sense that scientists are fabricating data/hypetheses for personal gain",7.1911823e-13,5.541523e-29,6.28795e-10,1.5995369e-17,5.5587913e-13,4.2259677e-18

Unfortunely you are correct, I refuse to accept it because it's not 100% for certain and that's my problem but do realize science is not always correct and new discoveries can create, alter, and destroy theories in seconds. The other problem is if we do make the changes the entire Earth would have to follow suit and that's just not gonna happen, humans are selfish creatures. Every country could agree to stop CO2 levels but in the end someone will not follow on their agreement and that's just how humans are..Stopping CO2 levels will also make a lot of people lose out in the workforce and you can argue that they will die if we continue these emissions but those same people will die anyway due to being unable to pay for their survival. It's a very bleak situation.

And in the process, we'll be left behind as a loud but ultimately ineffectual former hegemon. When I was a kid and learned about the Roman Empire, I imagined its fall to be a single event, the result of one final conflict. But it just rotted out from within. When the Barbarians took over, they often had their own puppet Emperors, even though it was the Barbarian chieftain of the day who held the real power. The ""Empire"" continued to exist, nominally, and generations of Romans lived and died without ever realizing it had become a fiction, until eventually it slowly dissolved. Some people find the idea of America losing its place in the global order to be unimaginable, because they expect it would take a massive conflagration to make us lose power.

blue_whaoo,"I think that it is pretty clear which direction Trump will go with energy policy, given his previous statements, and given that he has appointed Exxon Mobil's ex CEO to his cabinet.And I would wager that he is not going to give incentives to renewable energy producers. And it is impossible to protect the environment without regulations. If it is more profitable to damage the environment, it will happen. By removing (as he says) ""harmful and unnecessary policies"" he is actually creating incentives (profit) to companies to harm the environment.I guess where I disagree is that I think that many of the existing policies are necessary, because I believe and care about global warming. Those who disagree either don't believe, or don't care. There will always be those who will clear forests, wipe out fisheries, or pollute the environment for their own self enrichment.

Clintius_Maximus,"I think the only positive thing to come out of this whole mess, is that it highlights just how broken democracy is. Now, I'm not saying we should throw democracy in the trash can and turn to communism, but maybe we need to start again. We need to take the core principles of democracy, tweak them and incorporate more modern ideas; principles founded on a system of scientific reasoning and logic. A system that isn't just secular, but perhaps anti-religious in nature, not through bigotry, but through truth and education. A while back, during his 2016 stand-up ""FreeDumb"", aussie comedian Jim Jeffries said something that struck a cord with me. He said that religious people are slowing us down. He said that the world is a train track, and society is the train. And at the front of the train, we have the engine room where we have the people who are running the show. We call these people scientists and engineers. These are the people dragging us all along, as they have for countless centuries. Long story short we have a giant carriage right at the back, 50x bigger than the front carriage. Filled with the rest of society. The anti-vaxxers. The Anti-GMO crowd. The Trump supporters. You name it. This carriage is so big that right now the carriage is hardly moving. And if those at the front were to just pull the pin, the train could move a lot faster.So what if we did just that, at least for a little while. Maybe its time for scientists to stop leading society from the shadows and stepped up to the plate. We need a nation of our own to call home, free from the meddling of corrupt politicians and the prejudice of the ignorant. The Seasteading Institute is already working towards creating floating cities. Out in international waters we have the opportunity to do what is necessary to save the rest of save the human race. Once they see the progress we've made, once they see that we were right all along, we can turn our wicked, techno-marvel train around and pick up the stragglers.If people won't listen, then you need to show them.

Did I get that right? I hope i'm making sense.And then you go on to say that if you look at data for carbon density in our atmosphere, it has spikes and dips around world events where we were using more and less fossil fuels.So first you argue that carbon causes temperature to go up, and then you argue that carbon level's have been going up.

morphinedreams,"> Okay first of all I don't understand how they can tell so much about carbon levels at different time periods from ice cores, sediment cores, biological proxies and tree ringsIce gets deposited each year, often in very thin sheets of snow. Ice cores have water in them, but as ice freezes it traps air in it. Ice from 10,000 years ago is going to have air from 10,000 years ago. This air will tell you what the CO2 and nitrogen levels were like in the atmosphere back when humanity was first discovering it was a good idea to grow food. Ice cores commonly go back hundreds of thousands of years, if we dig deep enough.Sediment cores are similar, and can be used for figuring out things like temperatures.Biological proxies are things like plants or animals we know don't tolerate certain conditions. If we find an arctic plant, fossilised down near florida, we know that it was once very cold there. Figuring out how old the fossil is tells us how cold it would have been at that point in time.Tree rings are often used to estimate the age of things, and you can infer the climate from looking at how the rings are spaced since they generally get laid down annually. These usually don't go back very far, and are only good for recent comparisons.>Oh wait, am I understanding you wrong? Are you saying that by observing these indicators, it's not that we learn about carbon levels at different time periods, but rather the information we extract shows that higher CO2 levels is directly related to temperature change. It's both. Temperature is harder to gauge, but you can do so by analysing the composition of something like a sediment core, where in the ocean there are animals who build calcium carbonate skeletons. [This NASA website](https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/schmidt_01/) explanation is probably more succint than I could ever put it:>What makes calcium carbonate important? The carbonate, originally dissolved in the oceans, contains oxygen, whose atoms exist in two naturally-occurring stable isotopes, 18O and 16O. The ratio of these two isotopes tells us about past temperatures. When the carbonate solidifies to form a shell, the isotopic ratio in the oxygen (written as δ18O) varies slightly depending on the temperature of the surrounding water. The change is only a tiny 0.2 parts per million decrease for each degree of temperature increase. Nevertheless, this is sufficient for us to be able to estimate the temperature of the water in which the forams lived millions of years ago. From this, we can see that temperatures in the Arctic Ocean were about 10-15°C warmer at the time of the dinosaurs than they are today!You might be interested to know that these same calcium carbonate skeletons, are responsible for the really white beaches you see on tourist ads and potentially on past and future holidays. All that sand is from skeletons built out of the stuff over many millions of years.>And then you go on to say that if you look at data for carbon density in our atmosphere, it has spikes and dips around world events where we were using more and less fossil fuels.Correct.>So first you argue that carbon causes temperature to go up, and then you argue that carbon level's have been going up. Great response thanks. I don't know what you're talking about when you say NASA temperature records and compare them to observations like the ones rom Mauna Loa Observatory, i'll look into it.NASA keeps temperature records for things like air temperature and SST (sea surface temperature). I believe NOAA does too. [Mauna Loa](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/obop/mlo/) is one of the most famous observatories because it's continually tracking CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, and has been doing it continuously since around the 50's. You can see their CO2 tracking so far, [here](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.png). Fun fact: It is actually organisations like this that are most imperiled by government temporary shutdowns. It creates holes in what should be continuous records.",2.994516e-15,5.261618e-30,2.1559469e-12,6.329405e-17,2.0157747e-12,8.3505654e-16
GrassHopper420MaryJ,"So from looking at the isotope ratio we can see that the ocean is 10-15 degrees Celsius warmer in the days of the dinosaurs than they are today. Are you saying this increase is due to human acvitity? That since the Industrial revolution or whenever we really started messing shit up, that we've increased the temperatures by 10-15 degree's Celsius? That seems a bit much doesn't it? Or are you not blaming these 10-15 degree's on human activity but rather just saying that through the methods explained we can tell that the temperature has changed by this much.Also, as far as learning about temperatures in the past from sediment cores, how does this work? It seems pretty impressive that scientists are able to tell how long ago specific ice sheets were frozen and then find out how much Carbon is in them; and they are finding Carbon levels were the same in all the ancient ice for a very long time and then ice frozen since the Industrial Revolution or something has had gradually more and more Carbon? So I'd assume only ice at the very top has excess Carbon in it. Does sediment layer itself out at a predictable rate through time so by analyzing sediment at a certain depth we can somehow study it and learn about the temperature of that time period?",1.7320087e-08,1.8680032e-23,2.952718e-10,2.556298e-12,2.1617315e-09,6.5958324e-12

Emissions need to be reduced drastically and not just in the US, but everywhere, including the biggest emitter, China. The kind of cuts needed are going to be painful to everyone and I don't believe that many of us will be willing to make those kinds of sacrifices, and it isn't fair to ask people to give up things and behavior that they take granted for.So while Trump will likely increase CO2 emissions if he pursues his oil and coal friendly policies, we are only going to be to slightly _more_ fucked.

Oceanswave,"Let's throw studies out for a second. They're created by humans and humans are fallible. Let's just use something that we *can* observe with our eyes and our hands for a second.You're not from the US, but I'm sure you've got a modern refrigerator in your house -- maybe not, but there's a good chance. Now you've put your hand behind the fridge and felt those coils on occasion. Yup. they generate heat.Now let's zoom out a bit -- you might live in a flat or perhaps a stand-alone house, but you've probably got an A/C unit attached to that. Relatively the same process as your refrigerator, doesn't chill as much, but cools a large area. If even you haven't stood in front of the A/C unit by your house or condo or office building -- if you've felt those refrigerator coils I hope we can come to the conclusion that those A/C units generate some heat.Let's zoom out some more -- Ever take a flight across Europe at night? Fly over, say Hamburg or London and look out the window of the plane? Yeah, there's a ton of those tiny lights stretching to the horizon. And each of those tiny dots probably isn't a full house, or a condo but a street light. so each one of those dots is probably say 1/4 a city block so there's maybe 6-7 houses or condos per dot.Now pretty much each one of those houses/condos/office buildings has one of those A/C units cranking out heat. We'll ignore the wintertime for now, but in the summer, we can just surmise that a bunch of extra heat being generated across all those houses and condos across Europe the US, Australia and more and more in Asia.Now those A/C units weren't always there -- they've really begun to spring up in the last 30 years or so, a bit later in parts of Europe, and Asia perhaps in the past maybe 10-15 years. You might have seen some of those gifs around that [show city growth from the air](http://www.businessinsider.com/gifs-of-chinese-city-growth-2014-3)Now doesn't it seem possible that all those A/C units attached to the structures in all the world could maybe effect the climate just a little perhaps? That a little bit of man-made climate change could exist due to those billions of A/C units that we use to enjoy our 70 degree during the summer?And this is without thinking of how cities can be warmer than rural areas just because there's more pavement and buildings absorbing the heat of the sun. Or how all those A/C units are being powered. Or the effect of billions of cars around the globe (those bonnets are warm to the touch after a sunday drive) . Or the effects of who knows what being released into the air. Remember those smog-filled Los Angeles sunsets from the 80s that seemly went away with unleaded gas and tighter emissions controls? Meh.Ignore all that because it's all a fairy tale from China because underneath those Shanghai smog clouds there's unicorns that poop gold bricks that they don't want the rest of the world to have.So we'll just use those dollars that we could have used to save ourselves from ourselves and use it to slowly boil the oceans indirectly.Because the job growth from that can be measured and those coal miners will be happy with their $14/hour putting in a glorious hard day's work and america will be great again and in a short 5-20 years statistically the current regime will be dead and buriedand the next generation can build more A/C units and expand the cities and mine more coal out of the ground and all will be fine and dandy.",1.749506e-12,9.769553e-29,2.1905594e-11,2.3366452e-16,3.0862746e-11,1.2741254e-15

Nephthyzz,"not sure if you are using sarcasm here or not....I don't think any one is disagreeing that the climate is changing on its own. That is a basic fact that is taught in 5th grade science. The debate is about humans speeding up that process. Which most scientific data done by CLIMATE scientists/researchers has shown to be true.Why do you think you know more then people who dedicate their entire careers to studying this stuff? Basically every single country in the world has signed the Paris Agreement acknowledging that Man is speeding up climate change and has come together to combat it. So i don't know why people still think this is fake. Your argument that it all depends on mother nature isn't true at all. We are releasing new compounds that the earth hasn't had naturally that are man made (Such as CFC, chlorofluorocarbons) which now interact with our naturally occurring atmosphere. CFC eat away at the Ozone though and is man made thus linking climate change to being man made. If you don't know what the Ozone layer is for let me freshen up your memory. > When the ozone layer absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation, it creates a source of heat and regulates the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. If the ozone didn't filter the sun's ultraviolet radiation, most of it would reach the Earth's surface, which would be dangerous for plants and animals.

He should not be trusted over verifiable work done by people with an actual career and education in climate science. He links to videos by PragerU in an attempt to discredit climate science. PragerU is run by Dennis Prager and is an ultra right Republican who is funded by fraking and oil companies. He also has a degree in anthropology and history but nothing that makes him creditable as a climate scientists. No where in Pauls blog does it mention any scientific research done by actual scientists. It's just his own research and interpretation of it. But he uses places like PragerU as evidence. Which isn't a credible source in the least bit.And saying weather monitoring technology has not improved in 60 years is absolutely absurd.

Nephthyzz,"The ones that where changed, which where only a handful where changed, took readings from other stations I'm the area to correct for variations like new buildings be constructed or removed as well as taking into consideration the methods used to take those readings. . If you are worried about accurate data then you should also take into consideration things that affect the data and don't show the TRUE raw data. If a building is blocking sun then the data won't show the true temperature. A new building will create new wind Patterns and would cast a shadow which would have an affect on the temperature readings. Same concept if you remove a building near a station. You change the wind patterns which gives you a different reading. Agree or disagree? Should this data, even though it isn't the true data, still be used since it is ""raw data""? Or should it be corrected by using other nearby stations in a process called homogenization. Which is scientifically sounds. In no way does Paul discredit this method.Most temperatures that get corrected are over oceans, and when they are corrected they are more often than not adjusted to show lower Temps instead of rising Temps. Which goes against the argument that's scientists are changing the data to look like it's heating. Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit started by climate scientists that are skeptical of global warming has even said the data is legit and the methods used in correcting station Temps are up to par and sees no undue manipulation in the data.

Do you think Africa has the same set of standards that the UK does? Do they have the same standards as the US? Are we all using the same equipment? Same methods?

All_Fallible,Being on the forefront of the energy revolution does provide opportunities for new jobs. All new industries have that effect. We could have lead the world in that and had a commanding place in that market. Regressive energy policies are quick fixes that will leave future generations with the issues that you're only patching today. Eventually we need to move to renewables. That's inevitable.Look how fast China is to pick up that mantel. They know exactly how profitable it is to be the leader in the new renewable energy market.,1.5853897e-16,1.3714116e-32,1.1214208e-13,4.752324e-19,5.789273e-14,9.108603e-18
