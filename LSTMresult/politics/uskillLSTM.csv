Brightt,"It translates into this callousness because from what I've seen on social media and the internet in general, most US citizens are at least equally callous towards human life when it's elsewhere in the world.I'm pretty sure you feel similarly as I do when you hear about yet another bombing somewhere, or the earthquake in Iran (which got completely buried by the Boston bombing by the way). Of course, it's sad that innocent people died, but you're not going to waste your time grieving over people you had absolutely no connection with. Although, one the other hand, I'm pretty sure you don't, because I have a lot of family in Iraq, and although I don't know them on an emotional level, I hold my breath every time I hear about a bombing in Iraq because I'd hate to see my dad lose yet another loved one and having to comfort him for what I believe would be the 16th time in about a year time.Well, add to that that a lot of Americans are also hostile towards the Middle-East and there are actually some that encourage the violent US actions there. That and the fact that all US foreign policies tend to be covered up as much as possible as to not lose face make me have no sympathy towards you as a nation when it comes to tragedy. I know you are not responsible for my callousness, but your government (past and present) is. The fact that these kind of governments keep getting elected though, gives me the impression that many Americans don't want change, and are just blindly following, and are thus indifferent as well. As long as it's not on their precious soil though.Don't you see the hypocrisy in the fact that innocent people get bombed almost daily/weekly across the world by the US, and not a single collective outcry is heard from the US, but when it happens to the US, everyone should damn better feel bad for you, because, heaven forbid, 3 people died. I know that you probably don't agree as a person with the US foreign policy, but I'm also pretty sure you never actively tried to combat it either, even if it was just by protesting/even just trying to put people's minds to it by conversing about it.

deetofdoom,"I'll admit something which may be a bit taboo on this subreddit, but I'm an interventionist myself. White Man's Burden and all that. Without getting into the whole World Police debate, I'll say it is amazingly easy to fall into that line of thinking as an American. ""We'll help them out, by force if we have to. Give them that push towards the living American Dream."" I believe this is in large part due to how hard it can be to empathise with under developed, strife ridden nations. The poorest country the average American will ever visit (if they even leave the US, only 30% of us have passports) is Mexico, the 11th biggest economy in the world. How could poorer nations not want our help?It is that same unfamiliarity with the world at large that can make us seem uncaring and self centered. Combine that with American Exceptionalism and you end up with something of a petulant nation. However, I'd wager a good deal that if you picked a random American on the street, they would be sympathetic (though likely not empathetic) to the victims of that earthquake, or the bombings in Iraq. It also helps that in our melting pot, chances are you know someone hailing from the afflicted country. As others have said, it's important not to confuse the government for their people. I hold no grudge against the North Korean people, even though their government commits atrocities. I feel saddened when innocents die, regardless of where they are from.

yugoslavic,I completely agree with you and the thinking. It's hard for Americans to understand there's 6.7 billion people more in the world. My point is they can't think outside the box since they live in the box. A few can understand the viewpoint of someone from Europe on the United States.

peer_gynt,"> *Every* human? ... or you don't feel a lot of pain ...Well, it is hard to scale feelings, isn't it? So, what can I say... I think you need indeed some amount of understanding (you say association) to feel empathy - I was brought up in an environment where that was very important, and that does not stop with people you sympathize with. Let me put is this way: have you ever heard someone say that he/she himself/herself [1] is evil? 'bad', yes, which often pairs with low self esteem, or fear, in particular in children -- but evil? I don't think so. I believe that every person actually tries to do as best as he/she can to do good -- it is only that circumstances, education, believes lead to very different and contradictory meanings of 'good'.

Absolutely not. Drone strikes, the bombings of Serbia and Libya, attacks during WW2, there's a great selection to take from.Is it possible to precisely extrapolate feelings like that? Absolutely not.

eamus_catuli,"So much simplistic and flawed thinking. Where to begin...For starters, the Taliban didn't attack the U.S. Ever. al-Qaeda did. The U.S. Congress gave the President authorization to use military force against ""those who committed"" 9/11 AND ""those who harbored"" them. Ostensibly, the Taliban was ""harboring"" them - although evidence exists that for years (even before 9/11), they had been in discussions with the U.S. to hand Osama bin Laden and other key al-Qaeda figures over to U.S. or Pakistani authorities. Those discussions became moot when, in March, 2001 (before 9/11, of course) the U.S. decided that it would take steps toward seeing that regime change occurred in Afghanistan.""Returning power to the people"". The Taliban *are* the people in Afghanistan. Or more accurately, there is no unified idea of ""the people"". Afghanistan is an artificial creation of colonialist powers. Imagine taking Europe, and arbitrarily drawing a line around parts of France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands and calling everything inside that border ""Happy Land"". That's Afghanistan. It's a collection of distinct tribes and clans that colonizers threw a border around and called ""Afghanistan"". Like many other countries (particularly in Africa) where European colonizers have done this type of arbitrary line drawing - it's led to decades of disagreements and power struggles. The Taliban, believe it or not, ruled over a period of relative peace and harmony in Afghanistan. For this reason, they had many, many supporters in Afghanistan. (Which isn't to say that their strict Islamist sharia-based legal system shouldn't be frowned upon.)

It's also worth considering that a nation that *knows* that its deliberate attacks will cause a certain amount of civilian deaths is not taking their actions blindly.

The innocents are not just accidental deaths after the fact. The certainty of their loss are known from the beginning and are accepted as a reasonable cost for achieving certain objectives.

captsuprawesome,"Death of innocents is always an outrage.The problem with drones is they've been sold as a high-precision, no collateral damage, method of warfare. Furthermore their use has been wrapped in secrecy, so it's been hard to objectively judge them. Another potentially troubling thing about drones is that it creates an artificial distance between the attacker and the target. Presumably a solider on the ground will have to face the moral consequences of their actions (i.e. and therefore act more responsibly if faced with a difficult decision ) than a solider behind a computer screen thousands of miles away. Though if this is really different then a human pilot bombing someone is a fair point.Personally for me (and this is deviating from the original point), most of the ""drone debate"" boils down to a ""due process"" debate. I don't think the president should have the unchecked power to order the assassination of people (especially citizens) who he says are guilty of something but have never been charged or convicted of a crime.",2.5625968e-11,6.743794e-30,1.07406375e-11,1.0944202e-16,7.316157e-12,1.6734524e-15
verteUP,"Drones have been hidden for a reason. So people aren't brazen enough to think they can ""objectively judge"" a device of war. Because such a thing is not possible by the average citizen. These modern wars are the first in the history of the world in which every Tom, Dick, and Harry had their nose in them and thus has a supposed ""highly informed"" opinion. I mean you are comparing a drone with a human infantryman when you should be comparing a drone to a plane. Because that's exactly what it is. It doesn't create any more of an artificial distance than a human-in-the-cockpit plane creates. Both drop bombs. Both are piloted by a human. The fact of the matter is that drones do offer a surgeons scalpel. Drones are used to kill enemy combatants. It's that simple. Enemy combatants have never been given due process in any war. Blaming drones and Obama for a war started by Mr. Bush over 10 years ago is asinine and foolish.

captsuprawesome,"First, off the original discussion was not about drones, you're the one who brought it up and asked my opinion.Second, the discussion was on whether innocent people were dying. It is apparent that many innocent people are dying and that most of the casualties are not terrorists. We have killed more than twice the number of children than high profile targets. That is not really ""scalpel"" precision (as someone who commonly uses a scalpel, trust me on this). Third I think the death of innocents is a major issue - it is the number one recruitment tool for terrorist organizations. And it is the duty of the citizens to participate in public discourse and act as a check on their government. And you are wrong about people not caring about such things in the past. Have you heard of Dresden?Fourth I think you need to look back at how drone warfare was sold. It absolutely was sold as an alternative to an occupying force (drones patrol, bombers bomb). There is no question drones are safer for our soldiers. But are they more effective at making America safe from terrorist attacks? Well, when you create more terrorists (via the deaths of innocents) than you kill, you have a problem...Fifth your comparison on ""due process"" conflates a lot of issues in terms of what traditionally has been defined as a battlefield (in the past the ""battlefield"" has not been defined as the entire earth) and ignores important separation of powers issues that are the foundation of the Constitution.

If you'd like to have a serious discussion, I'm all for it (I've not downvoted you on anything).

verteUP,War is hell. Innocents will always die in wars. Always. There have been fewer innocent deaths in Afghanistan/Iraq than any war in history by enormous margins. You compare a drone to a human infantryman and then claim I'm the one who went off topic. Drone warfare was never sold as anything other than as a way to keep human pilots from dying. It doesn't matter whether a drone drops the bomb or a human pilot flying from the cockpit drop it. Drone attacks are not increasing the deaths of innocents any more than conventional bombing attacks. Drones can fly at very slow speeds and very low altitudes with high definition cameras capable of reading a restaurant menu. All of this at no risk to a human pilot. This is why they are used. They are a wonderful thing. They are a scalpel whereas a plane with a human in the cockpit is a hammer.

Hydrownage,">They didn't have to get the bomb dropped on them..Do you have any idea what you're talking about? There are many factors that lead to the Japanese not surrendering.1. A culture of young jingoistic military officers out to prove their honor as samurai-esque warriors, who believed in racial and Japanese superiority and supremacy. This was the class making the decisions at the time in Japan, not the Emperor or the people.2. Would you believe that a bomb could destroy an entire city in one explosion, had you not seen a nuke? Probably not, and the Japanese wouldn't have either. That's why America dropped the bomb *without alerting the Japanese* what would happen. They bombed first then asked for surrender. Besides, the bombs weren't even directed at a military target, they simply destroyed an entire city. What kind of accountability is that?

In reality, it seems to me that it's a terrorist attack if it purposely targets civilians, with absolutely no other strategic merit other than killing civilians. And, this..this is gonna get me in deep shit, but if that last bit is the definition of terrorist attack, it could be argued that 911 wasn't a true terrorist attack.

Stanrock,"I take resentment against a nation to include resentment against civilians as well. This may not be what you meant. You might have meant against the government and the military of a nation. If that is the case, then I guess I don't have a problem with someone comparing our reaction now to them raging against our nation (so long as this doesn't include U.S. civilians.) I mean, specifically, I think it is despicable that someone would target civilians, to be honest, more so than attacking a military base. The rage I have (if any) is toward the perpetrator. NOT HIS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN. (That's in caps for loudness effects, if you would rather that I didn't raise my voice then go ahead and ignore the caps.) Specifically, I don't have rage against Afghanistan. I had rage against the people who organized the attack on the Twin Towers. So, herein lies the problem. I don't entirely know what the journalist meant. Did he mean that harboring rage toward American Civilians is the same as harboring rage toward a terrorist organization? (I accept that the organization could be our government, however, I'm not a government official and I think that I deserve no such rage as I was not consulted when those decisions were made.)tl;dr If the journalist meant that people harbor rage toward our government and military for the killing of their people then I agree that the ""rages"" are similar.

mauxly,"You have an excellent point. I think, that in the USA, we have a distinct luxury of integration. We know people from all walks of life, we interact with people who hail from other countries, other religions, we have wonderful access to media and have access to opinions from varying outlets. It gives us the gift of understanding that a nations actions (military actions of the nation) do not necessarily reflect the will of it's people. And especially, the actions of a person do not reflect the will of the nation or the other citizens.However, imagine yourself in an isolated region, with little to no access to media, and little to no access to anyone of a different religion or race. And any access you have with people from a different religion has been under the guise of thousands of years of brutal tribal conflict. That, for generations, it's been drummed into your culture that people who think/look differently than you, will kill you if you don't kill them first. It could seriously warp your perceptions. And then imagine your village being overrun by white people in fatigues, breaking down your door, interrogating you, killing your neighbors. Or an American bomb lands in your neighborhood. I am not justifying terrorism. I am not justifying this mindset. I'm just honestly asking myself if some of the things that our military does (sometimes with the best intentions) doesn't come back and bite us as civilians because we rush in without understanding the cultural differences and the potential backlash. You, my fellow American, do not earn this rage. However, our military represents us overseas. So it is up to all of us to try to understand how our military actions might impact us here on the homeland, and then vote accordingly, for people who seem to have a realistic sense of the blowback of their actions. Again, this is in no way a justification of terrorist attacks. Anywhere. But trying to dig a little deeper into the mindset of the people who perpetrate them might help us adjust our foreign policy to reduce them.It could be argued that, ""Fuck the terrorists! Those backward ass motherfuckers don't get to dictate our foreign policy!""And I agree with that sentiment actually. But, the reality, is the only way to truly battle terrorism is to either quell the desire for it (stop poking the wasps nests), or to rip away at our own constitution and allow wiretapping, and searches, and indefinite detention, and torture...because this is a non traditional war, where any and all of us are suspect...What, in the long run, is our best option?Just asking lots of question.

Stanrock,"I appreciate your response. It seems fairly well-thought out. I understand your explanation of why people in isolated areas might target their anger toward all of us.

I suppose, though, what I hope for and reality are, at times, distinct from each other.

If an American is concerned only about his nation, he will not be concerned about the peoples of Asia, Africa, or South America. Is this not why nations engage in the madness of war without the slightest sense of penitence? Is this not why the murder of a citizen of your own nation is a crime but the murder of the citizens of another nation in war is an act of heroic virtue?...The real tragedy of such narrow provincialism is that we see people as entities or merely as things. Too seldom do we see people in their true *humanness*. A spiritual myopia limits our vision to external accidents. We see men as Jews or Gentiles, Catholics or Protestants, Chinese or American, Nergoes or whites. We fail to think of them as fellow human beings made from the same basic stuff as we, molded in the same divine image...

ChoppingGarlic,"I'm going to admit to over-exaggerating your response at first, but my problem was your phrasing. In the same way your original comment was a bit of an over-exaggeration as well.The phrasing that bugged me was ""rage"", even though it might be hard to find a more fitting word. That made the implication that everyone had the same sort of rage in that culture, even though a **lot** of people from the Middle East try to flee their countries because of the most represented mindset. The ""strongest"" mindset (because the other ones aren't represented, since they don't make much noise) is a sort of ""middle ages"" mindset, where intruders and women must die if they don't agree with their crazy ""holy"" rules. There's many atheists and calm religious people in the Middle East, but they get killed (in some of the countries, not all) if they release that information. So they either play along to keep their heads, or they run.The invasions aren't clear to have left a positive impact, as there is as much terrorism as ever there.

I don't know where you are from, but if you were in the USA, you'd know that there are a whole lot of people here fighting to prevent America from going to war, with everything they have.And every time there is an attack on American soil, the Peace Movement is crushed under the weight of American anger. The truth is, if we keep getting attacked, Americans will freely give up their own lives and liberties (liberties which are critical to fighting this shit from the inside) to go back and slaughter who ever attacked us (and, unfortunately, they'll slaughter way more people that had nothing to do with the attack). People who commit terrorist attacks only strengthen and embolden the very people they are trying to stop. So, if you want the carnage to continue, go ahead and encourage and support these attacks on us. I, I live here, and I want the carnage that we commit overseas to stop. So I'm going to fight both of you, the terrorists, and the military strategists, with everything I have.",0.772794,0.0683657,0.79491943,0.27122432,0.24569762,0.04219627

You seem to imply that the US set out to kill these children, which is blatantly false. You have no evidence for it, there's nothing to back up your claim. Feel free to provide some evidence if you're going to try to make it.Firstly, we know that the UN passed resolution 660 by a vote of 14 to 0, with one abstaining. You want to blame the US for a vote that was essentially unanimous? Try 14 different nations at least. It was Iraq who then refused to comply, so give them a large part of the blame in continuing this chain. Then the vote on sanctions was again 13 to 0, with 2 abstentions. Note no votes *against* here. The resolution was reaffirmed later by 12 nations with only Cuba voting against. You see, in the real world, the UN steps in when a country is violating the Geneva Protocol, but perhaps you don't care about the use of chemical weapons. Would you argue that the nations of the world shouldn't step in when they know a country is using chemical weapons like Iraq was? Perhaps you think the part where they were gassing Kurds and such is fine. We know that Saddam's regime was responsible for the deaths of at least 250,000 Iraqis, his own people. We know he was deliberately committing genocide (not just having someone resign and suggest it fits the definition) of Kurds estimated between 50,000 to 200,000. There was the Halabja poison gas attack that killed 5,000 and maimed or debilitated another 10,000. Estimates of up to 1,000,000 dead during the Iran-Iraq war. These are all before the UN resolutions too. There's the fact that Bush may have been swayed into taking the stance against Iraq by Margaret Thatcher. Note that it was also partly the fact that the Soviets worked together with the US. The trade sanctions were meant to remove the ability for Iraq to continue using chemical weapons. We know that Hussein himself claimed that the sanctions worked for disarming them, whether his son-in-law claims they were hiding extras or not. The Oil-for-food program largely benefited the Russian state, not the US. Most importantly, we know that approximately 60% of the Iraq population relied on the food program of the Iraqi government. The same government, and probably the same people, that had been responsible for the deaths of 250,000 Iraqis already. Their food program gave only 40% of the required calories per day. Do you really believe that the government, noted for terrorizing/killing it's own people, was doing everything it could for those people? The idea of it is ridiculous.The reports of the number of deaths also vary greatly, even as low as 170,000. Some reports say that the lack of change in Iraq's population growth over the period suggests the sanction death toll reports are much *lower* than reported. In the northern regions which were autonomous (that is, with less of the Iraqi government) the infant mortality rate *declined* due to better food allocation. David Cortright, American scholar and peace activist, said >""The tens of thousands of excess deaths in the south-center, compared to the similarly sanctioned but UN-administered north, are the result of Baghdad's failure to accept and properly manage the UN humanitarian relief effort.""This points the the responsibility largely being with the Iraqi government itself, which was known for terrorizing it's own people and having been responsible for 250,000 of it's people.The fact that you try to imply the US pushed for sanctions to target and murder 400,000 children is just you using scare tactics and faulty logic.The fact that you continue to try to insult me, calling me a ""bastard"", trying to apply the 'jingoist' label, just shows you are grasping at straws.

Basic logic. You keep insisting that even though we pushed for these, because the UN consented that means not all blame is on us. I agree. So I took some absurdly small fraction considering the entire thing was our idea and pointed out that even if that's our portion of the blame, we are still mass murderers and we still deliberately targeted civilians. And afterward, we didn't say like you suggest ""oops, it was an accident, we fucked up"", instead we literally said on national television, using those exact words: ""it was worth it."">You see, in the real world, the UN steps in when a country is violating the Geneva Protocol, but perhaps you don't care about the use of chemical weaponsOh, a country violating the geneva conventions.

What excuse are you going to come up with for that? Was it worth it, killing all those children? And as for ""Saddam probably killed his own populace"", yeah, what a coincidence that even though he had been in power for a decade before and all statistics had been rising, as soon as we passed our sanctions people started dying. [That cliff-like drop off after a decade of Saddam's rule and rising numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iraq-infant-mortality.png) exactly where the sanctions begin is just a coincidence.

The whole point of the UN is that all the countries who vote in the issue have an *equal* responsibility for the *entirety* of the action. I guess you would simply have let Saddam continue to manufacture and use chemical weapons on whoever he wanted? Would you like to see some pictures of the children he was using them on, or do they not matter to you?I think it's funny how you conveniently skip over the point that destroys your whole argument. Lancet and UNICEF studies showed that infant mortality **decreased** in the northern UN-administered region. That's right, *decreased* compared to then Iraq was running that region. So let's see, where the UN was in control, mortality rates decreased. Where the Iraqi government, which we know to have terrorized and murdered it's own people, was in control of feeding said people, the mortality rates increased. Gee, I wonder who bears the responsibility there?But of course, it's far more beneficial to your strawman argument vilifying the US if you blame the Iraqi starvation of it's own people solely on the US.Also, for the record, you shouldn't use a quote based on another logical fallacy, the loaded question, in your argument.

If one judge brought the whole case up and then pressured that all the other judges should agree, that judge would bear the majority of responsibility. That's why as I pointed out earlier Wiki calls with US sanctions against Iran is exactly that: US sanctions against Iran and it notes that the US pressures the international community to agree.With regard to chemical weapons, the entire Kurd genocide does not reach the death toll of our sanctions. It does not even reach half.As for infant mortality in the northern region, the studies found it decreased between 1994 and 1999, when most of the deaths had already occurred. The by far sharpest increase in clearly visible [in this graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iraq-infant-mortality.png), and it occurs in 1990 when the sanctions were implemented. It almost evens out in 1994 after the huge plunge before. You throw your claim out there as if children started living more in some regions after our sanctions, whereas in reality incredible amounts died and then there was a very very slight decrease from the appalling amount that child mortality had fallen to after we implemented our sanctions. In 2005, the child mortality rate was still over 3 times what it was in 1990, and a [recent UNICEF study](http://www.unicef.org/media/media_66724.html) found very little improvement; that's over a decade after Saddam has been removed. Additionally, the regions Saddam administered were poorer and far more damaged in the war. And Wiki notes that it was much easier to smuggle things into the UN administered region as well. But this period is well after the majority of the deaths occurred, and even that ""increase"" pales in comparison to the plunge that we caused right before that.

I guess we should have let them keep dosing children with mustard gas? I mean, there weren't as many deaths so that was okay, right? lolThe fact remains that where the UN was responsible for the region, death rates decreased.

Infant mortality rose from 47 per 1000 live births during 1984—89 to 108 per 1000 in 1994—99, and under-5 mortality rose from 56 to 131 per 1000 live births. In the autonomous region **during the same period**, infant mortality declined from 64 to 59 per 1000 and under-5 mortality fell from 80 to 72 per 1000.""This is based on a survey on the years **1989** to 1999.

As for Saddam's chemical weapons usage, yes, I am totally downplaying it by pointing out that it killed half the people our sanctions to supposedly stop it did. Your point makes no sense: 'look, we did it to stop Saddam from killing all those Kurds.. by killing twice the amount of people he did.' For varying estimates, I like how you use Lancet and UNICEF data for your claims of regional improvements, but when they both report over 500,000 deaths they are suddenly unreliable. How convenient. The majority of estimates are 400,000 or over, that's a fact. Even the lowest estimate there of 170k is still equal to how many people Saddam killed in his Kurds genocide. Doesn't make sense to stop a genocide by doing another one, does it.As for values, LOOK AT THE FULL REPORT. Page 4.

berylthranox,"In World War I Amir Faysal is promised an independent Arab state in exchange for his aid in starting an Arab Revolt in the southeast of the Ottoman Empire. Faysal eventually captured Damascus but was forced out by the French after the war was over because the secret treaties by the ENTENTE POWERS had already promised that region to France. Iraq was, under Ottoman reign, ruled as three separate regions which were ethnically or religiously distinct. These regions included mixes of Sunni and Shii Muslims and minority groups amoung them. After the war it was important that the Entente powers appease Amir Faysal who led a very auspicious and influential family. This was done by granting him the title of King of Iraq in 1921. Faysal was a Sunni that ruled a country which was majority Shii and contained the oil fields of Kirkul and Mosul which were inhabited by Kurds. In 1958 a coup d'etat occurred which overthrew the monarchy and gradually transmitted power to Ba'athist Party member Saddam Hussein who became powerful enough to attain the title of dictator. Hussein then went on to attack Iran in the First Gulf War which was used as a proxy theater for the cold war. Iraq annexed Kuwait in the 1990 Second Gulf War and U.S. forces intervened.

No matter which way you cut it, this situation was a complete disaster for the United States and Britain.To say the US and Britian deserved to own the oil there is - to put this nicely - laughable. How did the US and Britain obtain rights to the petroleum industry in Iran? It's really no different than how they acquired all the other resources internationally. But this isn't an important part of the argument.The Iranian government (democratically elected) chose to nationalize the petroluem industry. The industry did not allow itself to be inspected by the Iranians for fair play. Iran saw that an industry controlled by outsiders was either causing harm to the country or could be better used for its people, so Iran thought it had the right to oust them. The UK took Iran to the UN International Court, and Iran won. The UK then went to the US and the event played out.Finally, the Shah's father had tied to Nazi Germany because of economic relations, and was ousted by the allies for his son. Whether his son had Nazi leanings, I doubt. The military dictator put in place after the operation had ties to Nazi's like the Shah's father, for which he was jailed during WWII when Reza had to step down. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abadan_Crisishttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany%E2%80%93Iran_relations#The_first_Pahlavi_era_and_Nazi_Germanyhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat",4.5433773e-10,2.7423102e-22,5.990941e-08,1.711745e-12,1.4876582e-08,3.4637893e-11

When America exerts influence in a region to overthrow a regime it does not agree with, it gets huge criticism (and usually rightfully so). Conversely, when the US sits idly by, like it did in Rwanda and Sudan, like it did in Libya, and like it is doing in Syria, you have those calling for US intervention. I have many friends in Venezuela (of all social classes, not just the elite), who told me that they were praying for US intervention to remove Chavez, going back 10 years.

I believe in self-determined sovereignty, but there are a lot of times when the international community turns a blind eye to horrible atrocities. Unfortunately, the US (and no other country, for that matter), has taken a humanitarian stance on removing horrible regimes, but instead has only done so in cases of self-interest (which in reality, makes perfect sense - what country acts against their own self interest?).Should it be the international community's/America's responsibility to police the world? Should a completely hands off approach be applicable for every situation, refusing to ever interfere with another nation's sovereignty?

Armadillo19,"They keep going in because what's done is done, and like you said, the precedent has been set. While American intervention may have helped breed Islamic fanaticism at a higher rate/larger prevalency than would have occurred (debatable, but the argument can most certainly be made), at this point there is no turning back, unfortunately.

It may have occurred without American foreign intervention, or America may have helped catalyze it, but what's done is done and there is no going back.At this point, America can only mitigate by amending future policies, and I think that the Obama administration has worked hard to try to do this - yes, I realize there are drone strikes all over Pakistan, Afghanistan etc, however the US showed restraint from intervening in Libya, Mali, Egypt, and now Syria (some would argue to a fault). But with past engagements, you can't just take it back or go back in time to change your foreign policy. Would the Middle East be much more stable if the United States didn't go into Iraq? Would the entire landscape be much different if the US didn't prop up the Shah, leading to the Iranian Revolution? How about intervening in Central America, or backing governments like Pinochet?

Cenodoxus,">No one deserves to die for the sake of an ideological cause. That's the point. And I'm not inclined to disagree. But this wasn't a case of ""Allende was good and everyone in Chile was happy and bunnies frolicked in the streets and then HOLY SHIT THE CIA CAME TO TOWN and then everything sucked."" Allende was a polarizing president who did a lot of good things, but came extraordinarily close to destroying the Chilean economy, the value of the Chilean escudo (now the peso), and the country's agriculture. He also refused to execute any laws passed by the national legislature that he didn't like, or obey decisions from the Chilean supreme court that he thought were inconvenient. From the outside looking in, Allende was within shouting distance of being exactly the kind of dictator that America gets accused of instantly supporting. With respect to ""democratically elected,"" 2/3 of the country never voted for him, and Chile's legislative and judicial branches were increasingly unable to stop or influence whatever he wanted to do.Someone with a more holistic view of the situation in Chile might be inclined to question the extent to which the U.S. made any serious difference. It didn't send guns to Chile, it didn't send any other weapons, it didn't put boots on the ground, and roughly 2/3 of the Chilean government and most of its military (including its intelligence services) was afraid of Allende's increasingly brazen efforts to consolidate power, and pleaded with the Nixon administration for aid. The U.S. made the greatest impact in donating money to Chile's opposition parties in addition to (here's the really problematic part of the ""U.S. is teh evil!!!1!!"" argument) forgiving $200 million of old loans at the Allende government's request and providing both food aid and business grants. If we want to reduce this to a matter of numbers, the amount of monetary aid that the Allende government got from the U.S. was approximately 25 times greater than the amount the U.S. donated to Chile's Liberal and Christian Democratic Parties. It's incredibly myopic -- and for that matter, an amazing insult to the Chileans involved -- to characterize the coup against Allende as ""CIA-backed"" when the CIA was, at best, an incredibly tiny part of what was going on.",9.187878e-13,1.6268282e-32,3.0302063e-12,3.606687e-18,1.05814534e-13,3.9619734e-17

Cenodoxus,"More frequently it's a hybrid of the two that only succeeds in making everyone mad. Foreign policy in Egypt was/is a representative example. As a result of the 1978 Camp David Accords, Egypt became the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid in the world regardless of whomever was in power at the time. Over the decades, aid has shifted more and more to the form of military equipment and training for a particular reason. The U.S. has long since learned that monetary aid to most Arab countries has a habit of disappearing into bureaucrats' pockets with no effect on the local population, and food aid can and will be sold privately for the same reason. However, it's pretty difficult to steal something the size of a tank.The U.S. also supported Egyptian NGOs pushing for democracy and women's rights, and small business grants targeted at the poor, with a special emphasis on female and minority-owned businesses. This was distributed more privately and without fanfare in order to reduce the amount of corruption the program attracted, and most of the recipients were in fact unaware that the U.S. was the source of their grants.The end result was that the Egyptian population as a whole got to be pissed at the U.S. for ""supporting"" Mubarak, and the Mubarak government got to be pissed at the U.S. for being a political nuisance with its aid to democracy NGOs.

Yakooza1,"This doesn't explain shit.Allende won through a democratic process. Whether he was supported by the military or whether most of the people voted or not is irrelevant. Whether Allende was the best president ever is irrelevant. He won through elections and was supported by much of its population. The major opposition that he speaks of against Allende was the military junta and the likes of Pinochet, who took power in the coup and immediately started terror on his supporters.The US was afraid of him winning re-election so they funded his opposition and staged a coup, so as to replace him with a brutal dictator that was far less popular and less democratic than Allende. How is that all excused because Allende had faults? They turned their democratic process into a dictatorship, which produced far worse results in every sector that Allende was criticized for. >The possibility of Allende winning Chile's 1970 election was deemed a disaster by a US administration which wanted to protect US business interests by preventing any spread of Communism during the Cold War.[52] In September 1970, President Nixon informed the CIA that an Allende government in Chile would not be acceptable and authorized $10 million to stop Allende from coming to power or unseat him.[53] Henry Kissinger's 40 Committee and the CIA planned to impede Allende's investiture as President of Chile with covert efforts known as ""Track I"" and ""Track II""; Track I sought to prevent Allende from assuming power via so-called ""parliamentary trickery"", while under the Track II initiative, the CIA tried to convince key Chilean military officers to carry out a coup.[53]During Nixon's presidency, U.S. officials attempted to prevent Allende's election by financing political parties aligned with opposition candidate Jorge Alessandri and supporting strikes in the mining and transportation sectors.[54]Also>After General Pinochet assumed power, United States Secretary of **State Henry Kissinger told President Richard Nixon that the U.S. ""didn't do it,"" but ""we helped them...created the conditions as great as possible."" **(referring to the coup itself).[60] Recent documents declassified under the Clinton administration's Chile Declassification Project show that the United States government and the CIA sought the overthrow of Allende in 1970 immediately before he took office (""Project FUBELT"")And>The most prominent U.S. corporations in Chile prior to Allende's presidency were the Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies, and ITT Corporation, International Telephone and Telegraph. Both the copper corporations aimed to expand privatized copper production in the city of El Teniente in the Chilean Andes, the world's largest underground copper mine.[58] At the end of 1968, according to US Department of Commerce data, U.S. corporate holdings in Chile amounted to $964 million. Anaconda and Kennecott accounted for 28% of U.S. holdings, but ITT had by far the largest holding of any single corporation, with an investment of $200 million in Chile.[58] In 1970, before Allende was elected, ITT owned 70% of Chitelco, the Chilean Telephone Company and funded El Mercurio, a Chilean right-wing newspaper. Documents released in 2000 by the CIA confirmed that before the elections of 1970, ITT gave $700,000 to Allende's conservative opponent, Jorge Alessandri, with help from the CIA on how to channel the money safely. ITT president Harold Geneen also offered $1 million to the CIA to help defeat Allende in the elections.[59]It should be precisely clear that the US served only to better its business interests without any regard for the well being of Chile. In doing so they destroyed a viable democracy and replaced it with a dictator.Just because the conditions in Chile weren't the best possible does not at all excuse the US of imperialism.",1.7462945e-13,2.7194352e-36,6.752576e-14,2.6452567e-20,3.2627267e-16,2.528064e-19
Cenodoxus,">The major opposition that he speaks of against Allende was the military junta and the likes of PinochetThe major opposition involved was 2/3 of the Chilean legislature, the supreme court, its national organizations for various businesses and trades, the military, the national banks, and roughly 2/3 of the population that never voted for him anyway. Allende didn't give a shit about the Chilean constitution's limits on presidential power. Imagine for a moment what would happen if a U.S. president stopped signing any Congressional bill he didn't like no matter how many votes it got, decided not to recognize or enforce any Supreme Court decision with which he didn't agree, and instructed his administration to override or ignore any law on the country's books that as inconvenient to their political agenda. The only possible result would be an economic implosion and total chaos. That's what happened to Chile when Allende started disregarding his constitutional mandate, and all of it in a nation where he'd never had a majority of the popular vote anyway. His heart may have been in the right place, but there's a term for leaders who go power-mad and start doing whatever they want under the rationale that their agenda's more important then the law.To describe Chile as a ""viable democracy"" in this period simply bypasses the destruction to the democratic process that Allende himself had caused.

Cenodoxus,"I've left a few other comments in the thread that expand on some examples. I would argue that more education on the history involved will serve to illuminate the following: - The limits of American power and influence. - Other people in the world are just as important, if not more important, to the outcome of the events concerned. America is one actor of many, albeit a large one. - Matters are always far more complicated than screaming ideologues on either side are prepared to acknowledge.I would also argue that many of the world's current problems derive from the reckless creation of meaningless national borders by former empires (see Africa, the Middle East, and a wide swathe of Asia). The U.S. had nothing to do with the partition of Europe's colonial territories, but is nonetheless on the hook for dealing with the socioeconomic failure that was generally the result.And the reason I find Reddit's sometimes vicious anti-Americanism irritating is that once someone's finished explaining what a giant sack of bastards the Americans were in, say, Chile, they are almost never able to explain in detail exactly what the Chileans themselves thought or were doing at the time.

That's because they think the Chileans are only important to history insofar as they were ""victims"" of the Americans.

The CIA believed the Sandinista's overthrow of the Somoza government was a cover for the creation of another Soviet satellite state, and one that was all the more dangerous with advancing Soviet ICBM technology. The Cuban missile crisis was the closest that the world had come to nuclear war, and the CIA had no intention of allowing the set of circumstances that precipitated it to happen again. Hence the U.S. support of the contras, who had plenty of their own gripes given the violent consolidation of the Sandinistas' power and their repression of free speech and free association in Nicaragua. As with Chile, the U.S. didn't create the opposition to the government -- it supported the opposition that already existed.What a lot of people forget (or otherwise don't know) is that Congress had initially approved $100 million in aid for the Sandinista government in 1979. This was before reports started flooding in about the Sandinistas' crackdown on dissent and their own set of death squads ""disappearing"" former Somoza government members and anyone from within their own ranks who questioned the junta's political decisions.

Honestly, I haven't been mad about any of this for quite some time. I'm tired. I'm sad... I came to the realization last year that I've not lived a single year on this planet during a time of peace. Every breathing moment of my existence, there have been at least 2 countries in open, armed conflict. Almost every single movie I grew up loving, the core conflict has degenerated into base violence. Every cartoon, every children's movie especially, has had it's triumphant climax as a brawl of some sort trying to make it something laughable or entertaining. Every video game from Double Dragon and Super Mario right up until Catherine, it was at it's core a game about beating up the bad guy. There has always been a bad guy. There has always apparently been someone envisioning a need for a target. I have never been in a world that even so much as took a break from violence, on any political level. I've never been in a world where someone didn't have a vested interest in making sure someone else was afraid of a generalization, so that they could keep doing what they needed, but usually just wanted, to do. And it all makes me immensely sad. When I hear about people killing others, I can't bring myself to be angry. I hear someone demanding a death penalty, and it weighs down on me. The entire world seems to want to burn every patch of dirt it isn't standing on itself. I don't even question that part of it anymore. the only question that I've got left: what lets the world forget that what just happened was tragic, when it's not happening to them.

Daps27,"Actually I'm sitting in my apartment in Boston and didn't realize this comment would shoot up so high on the front page nonetheless. I never stated I agreed with anything, the war in Iraq or Afghanistan.. I never said I didn't empathize with drones, or coups, or any of the atrocities that our country has or could have had a part of in the last 65 years, not just in the Middle East but anywhere.. I was referencing this article, in which Mr. Greenwald launched into point 2 about the eagerness to point fingers, and the speculation that somehow Americans were beating a second war drum. Not in this city - Maybe on Fox news or whatever the fuck anyones watching today. That wasn't the rage I was experiencing in the City I live in... What I was saying(and this is for you because reddit is fan-fucking-tastic at twisting everything around) is that no one in Boston I've come across is on any witch hunt. That I just got back from dropping off dinner to my girl whose been working at the Boston Medical Center all damn day and the last thing anyone wants to hear about is this Muslim Terrorist bullshit. That maybe we're not all fucking drones ourselves mouth breathing in front of the television waiting for the FBI to find someone so we can publicly stone them.. That maybe we are tired from a decade of war, that our temperament has changed and that we wouldn't be so foolish to fall into the same situation we found ourselves in after 9/11.. but who am I.. I've received some of the dumbest shit on here today for only coming to the defense of my city, and my country. And guess what reddit.. Drone Strikes suck, but lets not act like there aren't atrocities going on in the Middle East and around the world which aren't our fault. But maybe we served in different countries.. cause I didn't see rainbows and daises, I saw women and children, husbands and wives persecuted by the same acts of violence we saw in Boston yesterday. Shits fucked all over.. but I'm not going to sit here and compare the type of feelings I felt yesterday to someone in Pakistan. I didn't hate Afghanistan, Iran, Al Queda, I didn't hate Islam.. I just hated that act of violence. But you can continue to spit at others on here for not understanding blowback, the proped up Mubarak regime, WMD's, or the Iranian coup, or any of the other excuses for reasons to hate America - the last thing I want is to get into that type of argument... But there are a lot of people who hate America who aren't going to drop a bomb in a trash-can, there might be reasons for rage, but there isn't an excuse for this type of violence.. no matter where you live.

berylthranox,"The horrible things that happen in that area of the world are the result of policies from the early 19th century. I'm not saying that any blame can be laid at your feet personally but if you are part of an organization that tries to avoid prosecuting a man that cuts off children's fingers for war trophies then you can expect to have some rage directed at you. Blame the people that actually do bad things and acknowledge that some of those people were over there for the exact same reasons that you were and didn't handle themselves as well as you claim to have. Bad things happen and if you believe that extremist groups based in the U.S. won't take advantage of this event to justify violence around the world then you are naive. Once people find a group to blame there will be a backlash just as there has already been a backlash against Arabs. I've known people that donated their pay to fund a Christmas celebration for orphans in Vietnam during the war. That wasn't entirely uncommon but what struck me was that he died without telling anyone about it and his friend, that donated his pay too, told the story at his funeral.

While there might be problems with comparing the US military's actions with those of the bomber, there are parallels (e.g. the 'double tap') that invite comparison. When the message of the article is a call for greater empathy, and understanding of the feelings of those who experience this sort of thing all the time (e.g. the bombings with 3x the casualties in Iraq around the same time) I think it's a reasonable comparison to make. That said, I think more respect could be given so soon after a tragedy like this.

dsruix,"From a completely outside perspective, I think that there is some credence to the statement. But it's more about the unnecessary wars that America has a penchant for entering into, wars that, because of America's world power, pull the rest of the world in too. I'll give America the Afghanistan war. 911 was orchestrated by a regime as an unconventional attack on American soil. The backlash was expected. But, America marketed it as an act of terror and declared a war on terrorism. That, in my opinion, was the dumbest political move in decades. Terrorism is built on fear theatre. Publicizing the terror aspect only made terrorists more bold. I'd be willing to bet that the rise in terrorist activity in the wake of 911 occurred as a direct result of 911 being a successful terrorist attack, not because it managed to kill so many people, but because it succeeded in creating an atmosphere of fear around the world. This atmosphere was created in part by the way America labeled the attack and the way America, the largest world superpower, gamely participated in fear theatre. Then there was the Iraq war. You can always point towards the fact that Saddam was leading an evil genocidal regime, which it was. Yet that was not exactly the reason why the us went to war there. It was their reaction to fear theatre. They decided to put on security theatre (which really only fuels fear theatre) on the basis that Iraq had wmds that were a threat to America. Yet this war comes as just another war in the long game of American meddling within the region. America has a penchant for installing dictators and then coming back to topple them in the middle east. This brings me to how I see America. There's a reason why America draws so much animosity. It's because America is the big Jock who loves to stick his hand into everyone's affairs without bothering to wait for the rest of the student council to decide on the best course of action. America is brash and that brashness leads it to war constantly, often in reaction to previous wars as a way to correct it's mistakes.",1.0634271e-11,4.416275e-18,1.2839739e-05,3.9740274e-11,3.35078e-07,2.4926822e-10

pijjin,"So many people misinterpreting the point of the article it seems. What happened in Boston was a tragedy, and you and everyone else has every right to be sad about it. The point is that the horrible stories of families being torn apart and limbs being blown off are precisely the kinds of thing that happen every few days over on the other side of the world, and too often at the hands of Americans. Every time an American drone accidentally sends a missile into a group of innocent civilians, similar scenes of carnage, emotion and devastation result, and yet when it's not white people, nobody seems to give a shit. Why is there such a disconnect that we pour out grief (as we should!) when something horrible like this happens in the west, but we just turn a blind eye when we're the ones doing the killing in some far away land.If Obama would show even a fraction of the same amount of sadness and emotion that he did over the Boston bombings when he heard news of Iraqi civilians dying in American bomb blasts or missile strikes, would it be policy that [all military age males in a strike zone are automatically assumed to be terrorists?](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/29/drone-attacks-innocent-civilians_n_1554380.html) What the fuck are we doing?Yes, be sad about what happened in Boston. But for all the horror stories that we hear coming out of Boston, remember that for some this kind of bullshit is a daily reality, and that even if it's not always us with our fingers on the trigger, it is our war mongering that has destabilised that region in the first place.

TristanIsAwesome,"I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion, but I have to say that I disagree with your assessment. ""The terrorists"" (at least the ones in the Middle East; not sure about this Boston guy(s) - he (they) could have a mental illness) *are* trying to protect and preserve what they see as the correct way to live, what they see as their culture.

YouShallKnow,"1) there is no ""extreme percentage"" of civilian casualties by drones; the anti-drone advocacy group, living under drones, puts that number around 1/3 which beats the hell out of traditional tactics in traditional conflicts. So drones actually have an extremely low level of civilian causalities when compared to regular warfare tactics. 2) I didn't say that drone strikes are only conducted in areas free of civilians. I explained how a ""double tap"" drone strike could feasibly be used to destroy exclusively military targets. Your proposition that the technique alone was proof of our intent to target civilians, since the technique targets rescuers who are presumably civilian. I pointed out that if the rescuers are the target's militant traveling party, than a double tap would be effective at destroying a military target and thus isn't evidence, in and of itself, that we're targeting civilians. 3) How many incidents of the double tap drone strikes have occurred?

An ""unknown combatant"" is somebody the administration classifies as a combatant because he/she was killed an an area they thought combatants might be and they don't know who they were. In other words, if you are killed by a drone you are a combatant until proven otherwise. And furthermore, the program is covert, we only get a fraction of the figures and in many rural areas, they don't even bother to do accurate counts.

There's a huge fucking difference.It is only a ""huge fucking distinction"" if you believe the US has the right to arbitrarily decide who is a ""terrorist"" and then decide its okay to kill some civilians in pursuit of said ""terrorist"". Like if the Boston bomber claimed somebody at the finish line was a ""terrorist"" target in their estimation and they would have preferred not to hurt anybody else but they had to bomb the ""terrorist"" in the crowd, would that change the situation at all? Of course not, it would still be a horrendous and unjustifiable act. I agree there is a distinction between directly targeting civilians and targeting areas where you know civilians will die but not caring too much. For the victims, however, the distinction is minimal. So if someone in Yemen has their family killed because the US has some shoddy intelligence about a guy down the street and figured they'd act on it, it feels the same as directly targeting them. > How many times have we blown up a ""whole apartment building full of people""?

Phantai,"As tragic and as absolutely devastating the Boston attack was, America has racked up a much, much, MUCH bigger body count of innocents. This one incident doesn't even come close to the body count of recent drone attacks. Even worse, the drone attacks are statistically negligible compared to some of the atrocities America has committed in the last 70 years.Starting with the fact that the United States is the only country in the history of the world to have actually used atomic weapons on people, they killed **250,000** innocent Japanese citizens in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Entire cities were destroyed. Homes turned to dust. Those unlucky enough to have survived lived in agony for the remainder of their short lives. Radiation poisoning and blindness plagued many many thousands. Ignoring the questionable involvement of America in the Korean war (since many of the atrocities were committed by the Koreans themselves), the next laundry list of atrocities comes from the Vietnam war. The My Lai massacre resulted in the death of **500**~ innocent people, many of whom were women and children. Agent Orange destroyed MILLIONS of acres of vegetation, and poisoned local food and water supplies, resulting in **300**+ deaths and deformations (this is much harder to quantify accurately). **400,000** innocent civilians were killed by napalm bombs that Americans dropped on farms, and non-militant villages. Many of these people were also women and children; fire doesn't discriminate. Then we have Operation Condor, which resulted in **50,000**+ civilian deaths and **30,000** missing (with even more detained without habeas corpus) civilians in Latin America, all for the purposes of propagating American idealism (without the support of the American citizens). The bombing of Yugoslavia resulted in as many as **5,000** civilian deaths.The Gulf War saw **100,000** civilian deaths, the War in Afghanistan saw more than **12,000** (although the statistics are very incomplete), and the Iraq War saw more than than **100,000**.Not counting the dozens of proxy wars which America initiated or supported, the death toll of innocents as a direct result of America attempting to impose its values onto the world (eerily ironic) is easily over **1,000,000**.A million INNOCENT CIVILIANS dead by America's hand. Try to fight the emotional disconnect associated with such a large figure. Each and every single one of these people had a mom and a dad. Grandmas and grandpas. Maybe brothers and sisters. Cousins. Friends. Teachers. Every single one of these people had aspirations. Some would have been brilliant scientists, and others virtuosos of art. Each of these deaths haunt me, and I'm afraid that nothing I can ever write would properly illuminate the severity of these tragedies.My heart goes out to everyone affected by the Boston attack. It's heartrending even imagining the difficulty of dealing with something like this. My sympathies go out to you. I just hope that this tragedy does not arouse an anger in Americans that will result in the deaths of many, many more civilians. Any life is precious.EDIT: A few thoughts. 1) So I'm not accused of only showing one side of the coin, here are the numbers of innocent American civilians that died on home soil as a result of foreign attack.**78** civilians died in Pearl Harbour (although it was a military base, I will still count this for argument's sake).**6** people died in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.**3,000** died on 9/11.While tragic and devastating, the number is less than **3,084**. That is 0.3% of the **1,000,000** civilian deaths caused by the U.S., in the same time frame.2) I understand that this is an emotional topic, and I'm sorry if this post hurt anyone. You have to view this post in the context of the thread, however. If I wanted to bash Americans (a people who I love dearly), I would have made a thread to do so. If your initial psychological response to this post is disdain towards me, there is little I can do to change that. I have not presented a political stance. I have not applied any ideological slant to the information. However, if you are interested in having an intellectual discussion about this, I am here, open minded and willing to listen.Let's reiterate my point (as I have done so several times in this post and in responses throughout the thread):**As devastating and angering as the attack on Boston may be, Americans must be careful when looking for someone to blame. America has been responsible for tragedies way bigger in magnitude, without any real repercussions. Aggressively responding may result in even more unnecessary civilian casualties.**",8.643647e-14,3.9077164e-30,1.4572906e-12,1.9520273e-16,3.7745803e-11,4.345412e-14

Then you can tell me about how civilians aren't deliberately targeted as a military strategy. Either way though, whether the action is deliberate or not, the consequence is very real. Secondly, civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan may not all have died at the hands of American soldiers, but they all occurred as a result of an unjustified American invasion.

The vast majority of the attacks the US is responsible for around the world are not targeted specifically at civilians unlike what happened in Boston. Are there sometimes mistakes? Yes. Those are indeed tragedies and nobody could argue they are not. However, it is very easy to start to get into a grey area when you get civilians as collateral damage, and it is more of a philosophy debate than anything else. For instance - lets say you know with 95% certainty that if you do not bomb a building housing a person who is plotting an attack, tens if not hundreds of people will die. You know he has the means for it. You've seen him purchase weapons. You've uncovered his plans. You just do not know if he actually has the guts to carry it out. You have the means to stop him. However, the only place you can with any amount of certainty take him out before the attack contains 5 innocents - do you do it? More than likely you are saving lives in the scheme of things but to do so, you will surely kill people who have nothing to do with it.It is a tough question with no correct answer.

They mostly live peacefully and you think nothing of them. But, a single one of them in their family acts up and assaults the other members of the family and occasionally assaults you. You warn your friendly neighbors that they need to pacify the dangerous among them, or you're going to have to take matters into your own hands. They do little, and you get assaulted again. How long should you take this abuse? When you ask the neighborhood for help, they respond with fear of getting involved and/or indifference. You know that your neighbors are oppressed by the hostile member of their group and in the end you would be doing them a favor by neutralizing them.

AegusVii,"I'm not saying America is pure evil, or that it is even ill-willed.Most Americans are just willfully ignorant of some horrible truths.They play the ""My team is better than your team"" game, instead of hearing criticisms and responding to them.I'm critical on America because I want it to become the country that the ideal conveys.If America wants to promote freedoms, then its citizens should hold it to that and not just accept it when their government starts taking them away.If America wants to say it's the best, then it should strive to provide a legitimate reason why. Improve healthcare, improve education, raise the poverty line, etc.And the biggest problem of all: ""America"" is not the will of the people. Most of the time, it's a small group of fucking idiots who shout the loudest and push the people with brains out of the decision making process.America has some smart minds, yet they stay out of places they're needed the most.And 90% of the time, people don't act. They sit there and complain and rant about how somebody should do something about it, and never seem to realize that it's them that should be doing something about it.

Then you flipped out when I pointed that out. What'd you expect, upvotes for days? You're pathetic, and your posts are pathetic, and that's why you're getting downvotes.The comparison that was made in the article was that people who lose their loved ones to violence feel similar emotions, regardless of how those loved ones were killed or what the ultimate intent of the attack was. If you can't understand this simple point, well, I'd say it leads me more to toward the second possibility above.Finally, I highly doubt that you actually know what ""moral equivalency"" actual means, but even if you do, you haven't used it correctly here.

froggymike,"I would bet money that it is domestic. Although the attack seems basic, the amount of planning that was needed to pull this off would require a so much communication on behalf of foreign bad guys that shit-storm alarms would be blaring in every CIA office around the world.

pseudotensor,"Nobody seems yet to point out that quite generally there is always a moral ambiguity never a moral absolute. His point of view makes sense for a non-US person or someone fed-up with state-authorized murder. Many of those who felt negatively about what he said would cite how murdering innocents is different (false equivalence) than those in a war zone and similar arguments, which he could say is just a false dichotomy because murder is murder and it's just that you got sucked into the US definition of what's right and wrong using labels associated with terrorist vs. innocent or war vs. peace.One way to view people's views is by their patriotism. Certainly a US patriot will always see US policy and security above even non-US lives. On the other end of the spectrum is an anti-US terrorist or state, who views US policy and its selfish patriotism as hurting the entire world and driving it farther from world peace for its own selfish temporary wants.All these views are more or less correct, and the moral ambiguity is only resolved by choice and perspective. In the US we have chosen (either directly or indirectly through our continued republic democracy) certain moral truths that are quite selfish, but from a US person my perspective is also quite selfish and I somehow agree that some of the ""bad"" things the US does is ok, although many things they do are not ok to me.But living in the US as a representative democracy, I have no fine-grained control over those things.

Trapezus,"It's the age old morals vs effectiveness issue. Effectiveness **always** win in the end.I dare anyone to prove me wrong. Remember that effectiveness includes good PR. Bad PR in the right communities caused by whats deemed effective will influence what will be deemed effective. I suspect that the social media will change the wargame in an unimaginable sense if they stay unregulated. Especially in the developing world. Imagine, hundreds of millions of cameras in the hands of the lower classes in africa and asia. Every local community will be globally connected. Would our capacity for empathy be saturated to the point of lethargy because of this? In the same way that terrorism acts inside of the arabic countries have? In the same way Wikileaks passed from the public eye? I hope not. The user HilariousMax have been saturated. He realises that his concern is better placed in his community. He is lethargic in the face of overwhelming news which he feels unable to influence. Perhaps this means that local problems will be solved by local communities. Communities that are better informed than before. Waffles81 are still concerned. I fear that his concern will also saturate over time. Perhaps this means that foreign Communities will help the local communities for a short time in the face of disaster; such as the haitian earthquakes.

mcivor_1,No because if it gets Americans to look at their foreign policy and recent history of it then they would come to see how deceitful their government has been to their nation. After realising this I'm sure the more politically aware and humane of the Americans would also then take a closer look at their domestic policies and would also not like what they find. If enough Americans did as described above then they have the future of their country in their hands as it is the government that is supposed to serve the people in the peoples best interests not vice-versa and it is only the people that government should be accountable to. Therefore either way if it was domestic or foreign terrorist more Americans are aware of their governments actions and its within their power to change that for the better in the future. Also if this bombing was not done by muslim extremists i don't think the people of the middle east would mind the US reviewing and changing their policy in the middle east as they have lost many civilians in the last 10 years to American forces.,7.216953e-15,5.39615e-27,6.6200725e-11,1.7176893e-14,7.855539e-10,7.377098e-12

Yes, the US is being pretty damn sloppy about possibly killing innocent people. Yes, I can understand his outrage about this.But he is equating it to what happened at the Boston marathon yesterday, as if they are exactly the same thing ('exactly the kinds of ... attacks that the US has been bringing', '""double-tap"" attacks is precisely what the US now does').That I can't agree with. The primary targets at the Boston marathon were *known* to be innocent. The first responders were *known* to be innocent. There is *no reasonable case at all*, not even a hint of a reason to suspect, that any of them did anything wrong or associated with anyone who did anything wrong.In a US drone strike, the targets are *believed* to be guilty, even if it may be based on shady evidence, even if someone is just taking their best guess. And there is at least a rational basis to believe the people who try to rescue them or who mourn them *might* be their associates.Is it morally OK to take out some people who you aren't sure are guilty in order to get someone you really believe is? It's pretty questionable. **But at least it's questionable**. The attacks yesterday were aimed, knowingly, at 100% innocent, 100% civilians. That's not questionable morally. That's unquestionably immoral.To me, that's a pretty big difference.

independentlythought,"I think there's a clear difference in the U.S. accidentally, albeit frequently, killing civilians and terrorists intentionally slaughtering masses of innocent people. Honestly, this is really the argument I make when we look at how our government operates. America does stupid stuff- let's face it. We illegally tortured people after 9/11, we passed the Patriot Act, we screwed the Middle East several times over, and essentially pissed off the entire world. But I do not think that government officials did this out of malevolence or love for violence and oppression. I think that because of of the rights and wrongs that Western society teaches us, people in the government do not want to cause evil and tragedy across the world. They probably just want to do what is in the interests of the nation, because indirectly, that benefits them come election time. I know that there are tons of politicians and government officials who are low-life, self-serving, evil scumbags. But I do think that as far as the military and departments go that they are not trying to kill innocent people.With that being said, the motives that Al Qaeda operates behind are indisputable. We were attacked on 9/11, and most likely yesterday, for one reason and one reason only: America intervenes in the Middle East. I don't think we understand that these people see Saudi Arabia and the Arab geopolitical world as their holy land. When we start basing F-15s and tanks out of there, it's bound to most certainly piss them off. The best thing we can do is just stay out of the whole region.

GonPakaya,"Boston bombing was nothing compared what sri lanka had to endure for 30 years in its fight against Tamil terrorists. Every time LTTE set off a bomb in Colombo in its senseless unquenchable thirst for sri lankan blood, US and its European allies used to preach that the Tamil terrorist and the Sri lankan govt should sit down and negotiate peace! (If you wanted to know how dumb it was like, just imagine the Sri Lanka govt advising the Bush govt that they should get down to peace negotiations with the AL quaeda after 9/11) Later when Sri Lanka decided enough is enough and the terrorists were on the verge of annihilation, who steps in, but Uncle Sam to save the LTTE terrorist leader Prabhakaran from a certain death. By some luck Sri Lanka manage to completely eradicate terrorism from its shores, despite all the covert backing these terrorists received from US and its European allies. However even todate Sri Lanka is hounded by US for phony ""war crimes"" charges, and the relationship between a once very US friendly nation Sri Lanka and US has hit rock bottom.

Also it's not only the US bombing targets in the Middle East, but their allies aswell. Given, our soldiers are there mainly as a result of US actions and we 'only' fulfill our duties as NATO partners, but we should not forget that our armies are in Afghanistan also, because we as Europeans have (economical) interests in this part of the world, and, at least German soldiers (and again, I think it's safe to say this also applies for British, Canadian, Dutch, Australian, French and all NATO troops), made terrible mistakes over the years aswell.

phil08,"This is just the way humanity works unfortunately. What the writer speaks is the truth, but he has seemingly gone about it in a contradicting manner. How can you talk about the empathy of the American people and who they've attacked and killed without you, yourself, sounding like a nationalist/regionalist also. Now I could reference the map you may have seen recently on the front page depicting all of the countries Great Britain hasn't invaded and blah blah blah, but then I would only be conveying the same message as the person who wrote this and that is not what I am here to do. You see a long time ago it was specieism (Homo Neanderthal vs. Homo Sapien) just yesterday it was racism, today it's nationalism/regionalism and tomorrow it will be globalism, assuming we ever achieve colonization of another planet or interstellar travel in which to do so. And mind you we are still in a big transition period between this whole racism thing and nationalism/regionalism. It could also be that the two are deeply intertwined, in which, neither one will prevail over the other until the age of our civilization brings about a change in that altogether. Me personally, I live in my own little ""bubble"" if you will, as do the rest of us, limited only by how much knowledge we can/choose to intake at any particular given time . I don't actively pursue information of this type (what the human race is doing to itself, in this manner), nor do I personally condone what my nation is doing (since I was never personally consulted on anything my country does without my knowledge, i guess), its just that I don't know about it, and it's not that I don't care or don't want to know, its just like I said before, I don't actively pursue this type of information, but if presented to me will be taken in to thought and consideration. I just feel as if my focus is best used on other types of information, but that's not to say that none of this is factored in. Deep down we know ""what's up"" (left to the human imagination of course, but you at least have an idea/concept) even if we don't know or read about it, and its not that we choose to ignore it, it just gets pushed back on the list our minds prioritize for us and its just as though we seem to think that there are more important things than this logically. No persons priorities are the same but I feel as if this would be the general underlying consensus. Don't get me wrong, if I could change the way humanity thinks/acts, I would for the better (but then who am I to know whats ""better"" for humanity?), but no one person ever could I think. It would require a group of people to do so and in groups you almost always have corruption and so I think that that wouldn't work either. So in closing I regress back to my original statement. This is just the way things are. By no means am I saying ""life isn't fair"", but what happens to things you cannot change? You either die trying to change them, or adapt and come to terms, and I respect both of those outcomes whichever you may choose.",8.1423586e-08,6.709112e-20,1.8827481e-07,6.331323e-10,0.00031463648,2.1020679e-08

exposrule,"There is no comparison between an act of terror designed with the specific intent of causing civilian casualties and civilian casualties occurring as unfortunate but necessary collateral damage as part of a military objective during war.

Blacks commit more violent crime (by far) than any other group in America.You're literally part of the group which has the MOST violent faction in the US at it's core.Want more? How about someone like Obama obsessed liberal professor Amy Bishop, who went on a spree and killed 3 people at the University of Alabama? Before that she had been a suspect in a mail bomb case (and thus probably did it) and years before that she had 'accidently' shot her brother to death.Do you know WHY you don't hear about people like Amy Bishop? Because the liberal news media covers up such stories to the best of its ability. How about Kermit Gosnell, the abortion doctor in pennsylvania who has apparently killed at least seven babies born alive and a patient? The liberal media is outright ignoring this case and it is VERY current. How about Radford University criminal justice professor (noticing a theme here with the liberal professors?) Raj Mahon-Haft didn't directly commit violence, but it might not have been far off, he was a druggie with a childporn habit, arrested 3 times in one month alone for that shit.
