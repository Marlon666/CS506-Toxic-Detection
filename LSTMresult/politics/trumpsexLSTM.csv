SlaughterhouseIce9,"Here's some things Hunter S. Thompson had to say about Richard Nixon.> It is Nixon himself who represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character that almost every country in the world has learned to fear and despise. Our Barbie-doll president, with his Barbie-doll wife and his boxful of Barbie-doll children is also America's answer to the monstrous Mr. Hyde. He speaks for the Werewolf in us; the bully, the predatory shyster who turns into something unspeakable, full of claws and bleeding string-warts on nights when the moon comes too close…-> If the current polls are reliable... Nixon will be re-elected by a huge majority of Americans who feel he is not only more honest and more trustworthy than George McGovern, but also more likely to end the war in Vietnam. The polls also indicate that Nixon will get a comfortable majority of the Youth Vote. And that he might carry all fifty states... This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it — that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns, and no qualms at all about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable. The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes... understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose... Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?-> We've come to a point where every four years this national fever rises up — this hunger for the Saviour, the White Knight, the Man on Horseback — and whoever wins becomes so immensely powerful, like Nixon is now, that when you vote for President today you're talking about giving a man dictatorial power for four years. I think it might be better to have the President sort of like the King of England — or the Queen — and have the real business of the presidency conducted by... a City Manager-type, a Prime Minister, somebody who's directly answerable to Congress, rather than a person who moves all his friends into the White House and does whatever he wants for four years. The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It's come to the point where you almost can't run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.Imagine if he'd lived to see Trump. He saw it coming though.

Did I offend?Here's how it works:Libertarian politics is socially liberal and economically conversative.You can do anything you want socially, and don't have many taxes nor support from the government.They typically agree to smaller taxes for things like roads, schools, military protection, etc...Basically - they want to do whatever they want, and don't want to have to contribute to anything beyond bare neccesities.i.e. the exact same thing a spoiled, immature child wants.You see, as you grow up and see the world as it is, you realize the value of community and want to contribute to the world. You want to give back. And you realize that the whole rebellious streak of your childhood where you wanted to do whatever you wanted, meant that you hurt a lot of people around you...And as you do that, you grow the fuck up. You realize that consequences to your actions shaped and developed you as a person, and you actively want to work towards community. You get that no man is an island, and your youthful delusions of immortality of individualism fade into a balance between self and other. In summary, you quit being a self-serving prick who is only in it for himself. You accept the need to contribute and invest in a common future, and you realize that laws, regulations, and protections against the 1% of people born as sociopaths are neccesary.i.e. you realize that libertarianism is just a rebelious, youthful pet theory, and has no place in a world full of grown-ups.",0.06387797,2.2351734e-20,1.74097e-06,2.5090433e-10,2.0271439e-07,6.3144563e-12

It's likely that at least a third of such cases never get reported. My point being, it's not as simple as saying ""they really ought to have spoke up by now.""One woman is in fact suing:http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-accuser-summer-zervos-files-defamation-suit-against-president-elect-n708031",4.985483e-13,3.3559905e-37,2.1031454e-13,7.6519396e-20,6.05564e-17,1.9630303e-20

robotsdonthaveblood,"So we should always believe every claim of sexual assault? Every single one of them regardless of evidence one way or the other? That's a dangerous precipice you're on.Jian Ghomeshi was accused of sexual assault up here in Canada in 2014, for two years he was demonized, couldn't leave Ontario and had to reside with his mother as a grown man. His career as a national radio host ruined and his name forever plastered on the internet as a potential rapist. One allegation blossomed into more once media attention started hammering it into our Canadian faces all day long and soon one sexual assault charge was five, with an aggravated choking charge tossed in for good measure.You can check out the details yourself with a little google-sleuthing, but I'll spill the beans on my point here; collusion and deception. In fact Justice William Horkins went on to state that the inconsistency and outright deception of the witness' testimony had irreparably weakened the prosecution's case. Each complainant demonstrated, to some degree, a willingness to ignore their oath to tell the truth on more than one occasion.So in the world you want to live in would have Jian in jail just because some women said he did a thing and we shoulda believed them no matter what. Thankfully, Justice Horkins called the bullshit for what it is and the man is at least not in jail. He still went through years of legal proceedings, was still demonized for years in the media, lost his career, and still looks like a rapist the moment you google his name. That's fucked up, don't you think? And what's worse, you think these women would have been held in contempt at the very least, but no, there was no consequence for what they did to Jian, or lying under oath, or misleading the public, so on and so on... No, I don't think we need to be taking every accusation at face value, because you see, contrary to what your hugbox article states; they WERE lying, and a judge caught them doing so. Edit: if people really want to help get justice for victims of sexual assault, you have to encourage them to do what must be done with any crime; report it immediately. You do not wait for your house to burn down to call the fire department, or the corpse to bloat n decay to report a murder, you report it as fast as possible to ensure the highest possibility of getting justice for the victim. It may be very emotionally traumatic to have to recount the events so shortly after but life, particularly in that situation, isn't easy, no one ever said it would be. Don't wait 20 years, or even 20 days. Do it now! I mean, shit, do we afford the same luxury of infinite time for the poor souls who witnessed their loved ones being murdered?

Marshawk1000,"The idea is not that there should be no due process or investigation, but rather that a premise of belief of victims is both the humane and statistically supported (~95% are true) way to begin. It certainly doesn't mean accusers should be jailed without a trial, or that vanishingly rare cases, like the one you describe, are impossible. It's not dangerous at all, but rather a healthy place to begin responding to a unique and sensitive form of crime. And as my article mentioned, this is also how you get people to answer your call of reporting it immediately. Survivors of sexual assault are not just uncourageous across the board, waiting many years or saying nothing. The fact that so many remain silent is a clear indicator that this is a unique kind of trauma: it comes with a particular blend of shame, guilt, and stigma, frequent lack of justice, fear of reprisal, and other factors that make it exponentially harder to talk about. It's all too easy to condescend to survivors, not knowing what kind of experience this is.

The fact that they may feel badly 20 years later about the encounter does not make it sexual assault. It just makes it a feeling of regret. And regret does not translate to sexual assault or rape.

In 1833, Fanny Kemble, an English actress visiting Georgia, noted in her journal: ""The slaves themselves entertain the very highest contempt for white servants, whom they designate as 'poor white trash'"".[9][10]>In 1854, Harriet Beecher Stowe wrote the chapter ""Poor White Trash"" in her book A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin. Stowe wrote that slavery not only produces ""degraded, miserable slaves"", but also poor whites who are even more degraded and miserable. The plantation system forced those whites to struggle for subsistence. Beyond economic factors, Stowe traces this class to the shortage of schools and churches in their community, and says that both blacks and whites in the area look down on these ""poor white trash"".[11]How in the hell is white trash not a racial slur?",6.4585824e-06,5.2318493e-25,2.6344827e-08,9.7179584e-11,2.9078507e-07,6.694915e-11

SirHyde,"> I don't understand what's so hard to understand about the basic philosophy of the electoral college.It's not hard at all. It's just that the opponents of the EC understand that that philosophy is flawed to its core when we're talking about the current political federal union known as the United States. The US is neither a confederation nor an international organisation (like the European Union, for example). It makes little sense that a federal head-of-state in a presidential republic is elected by land or devolved political entities (states), when said political entities already have their own representatives in the form of senators, governors and local legislatures.> By arguing that we should go by the popular vote alone you're saying that the interior of the country should have absolutely no say in how the country is managed.No, what people are arguing is that every vote should count as much as the other. The interior of the country would continue to have a say in how the country is managed by the principle of one man/woman = one vote. Regardless, this is not a question of silencing voters, since the president can only be ONE individual, therefore some people's say in how the country should be managed will be ignored, but rather it's a question of whether the process should be fair or not. A PV vote is fairer than the current EC arrangement. A STV type of voting would be fairer than both PV and EC. > People in Los Angeles shouldn't have 100% say over the lives of people who live in Nebraska.The argument could be made that people who live in Nebraska also shouldn't have 100% say over the lives of people who live in Los Angeles. The only, problem, however is that neither Nebraskans now Angelenos have 100% say over each other's lives, rather Floridians, Ohioans and North Carolinians do.

It's a problem that arises in direct-democracies, that is why most countries have chosen representative democracies.

Don't let it break or you might have to deal with reality.A large part of the world would have said the same thing if Hillary was elected.Mysandrist Hillary Quotes.""Like it or not, women are always subject to criticism if they show too much feeling in public"" -how is this not a male issue as well?""Women have always been the primary victims of war. Women lose their husbands, their fathers, their sons in combat. Women often have to flee from the only homes they have ever known. Women are often the refugees from conflict and sometimes, more frequently in today's warfare, victims. Women are often left with the responsibility, alone, of raising the children."" - yeah dead men are not victims, this is perhaps the most vile thing I have heard anyone say about men in war. It blatantly ignores them and makes them a side story in the lives of women. Barely mentioned.""To LGBT men and women worldwide, let me say this: wherever you live and whatever the circumstances of your life, whether you are connected to a network of support or feel isolated and vulnerable, please know that you are not alone."" - If you are a man and feel isolated and vulnerable fuck you because the patriarchy? ""So let's keep going, until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves."" - Is she assuming that every man in America *already* has what they deserve or is this just another indication in an already long line showing she does not care about men?""We will defend all our rights – civil rights, human rights and voting rights… women's rights and workers' rights… LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!"" -men, ignored again unless they are a worker or disabled, jobless and male fuck you?""Women who want to work deserve to work. And whenever they are denied that opportunity, it's not fair to them – and we all lose out"" - People who want to work deserve to work but we can't miss out on an opportunity to use language to ignore men again!Na I don't need to listen to Hillary anymore when she so obviously doesn't even consider my issues.Here is comment I can get in line with by Chris Hedges.""The Democrats are playing a very dangerous game by anointing Hillary Clinton as their presidential candidate. She epitomizes the double-dealing of the college-educated elites, those who speak the feel-your-pain language of ordinary men and women, who hold up the bible of political correctness, while selling out the poor and the working class to corporate power."" - Turns out enough people listened to this that I don't have to live in fear of 8 years of being ignored, 8 years of continued decline in lifestyle and 8 years of it being harder to help my daughers in life.I also see her in the same light as Edward Klein explains in this quote """"She's the most unbelievable actress I have ever met,"" said a woman who worked on Hillary's Senate campaign. ""I remember one time at a Women's Leadership Forum event in New York, thirty of us sat around Hillary, talking about politics. And she said, 'You know, I love this organization, not just because we sit around and talk about politics, but because of the bonds of friendship forming around us.' The way she said it, people were riveted by her performance. But I had gotten to know her, and I could tell she didn't mean it. She has this unbelievable ability to be a liar. She is soulless.""Or perhaps we should listen to Abby Martin when she says ""As a woman, I completely reject Hillary's brand of bourgeois feminism because it leaves out millions of immigrant women, poor women, and the women under her bombs around the world."" I mean they both ignore men but at least Abby is a step ahead of HillaryAlso the protect women bullshit is just what they say it is when it comes out of Hillarys mouth as explained in this quote by Kathleen Willey ""Hillary Clinton is the war on women. And I think that she needs to be exposed for all of the terror campaigns that she's raised against women who were in the wrong place at the wrong time with her husband. And it's been going on since before they were married. That's how she handles it…The easiest way for her to handle scandals is to ruin the women who just happen…to cross paths with him. And that's horrible, and they do a good job at it.""Let me end this with another Hillary quote that showed her bias over 20 years ago.""If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights once and for all.""Hillary Clinton - ignoring men and mens issues for over 20 years!I don't agree with much of what Trump says and much of who he is, but at least I am in the conversation.

TrumpsGoldShower,"> The fact is, which you implicitly agreed with, this sub does remove posts that are popular and have a large number of discussions.I figured you were trying to make an actual point, like they are censoring certain topics even though they are popular.If your point is actually that they just delete popular posts sometimes, so fucking what? You claim there is the potential for bias, and sure, that is a potential. But your job should be to show it, I don't give a shit if there is a potential for bias if there is none.>That post was removed for breaking Rule #6, needs to be an article, video, or sound clip. That is entirely too vague and unreasonable. How is that vague? That example you gave is not by any definition an article. It was not written by a journalist to discuss some topic or to detail an event. It is an email that was given a web page.>Not only that, but mega threads are never a legitimate reason to lock down or remove a post. Megathreads are where discussions go to die. I agree, but again, this goes back to the whole bias thing. Show some bias or I don't really care.

TrumpsGoldShower,">I omitted one sentence, Yeah, fuck you. a man who is on the record, in his own words, describing how he sexually assaulted a woman. Too many who heard that story remembered his boast that he could do whatever he wanted, grab women “by the pussy,” but they missed the rest of his quote, in which he explicitly describes sexually assaulting a married woman:“I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”He never apologized. He never showed remorse. He never admitted what he did was sexual assault.Eighteen years ago, while I was taking the number 9 home from Midtown to 121st and Amsterdam, a man ""grabbed my pussy"" on the subway. That is, while I was locked into the rush hour crowd, unable to move and with my arms around a large box I was carrying, a man reached under that box to stick his hand through my sundress into my vagina to fondle it. I tried to wiggle away, but I couldn't actually get away until the next stop, when I darted for the doors as soon as I could and then sat down to cry with the shame washing over me. I was “lucky”—though it's telling that I use that word—because I haven't been raped. But I have been violated, intimately touched without consent, that time and others.I never imagined that nearly two decades later, that subway experience would be the part of my history that dominates my thoughts on my birthday. But since my birthday is also inauguration day, I have a lot of company with other women, and men, trying to push away the memories of sexual assault that intrude upon them when they see the face or hear the voice of the president-elect, a man who is on the record, in his own words, describing how he sexually assaulted a woman. Too many who heard that story remembered his boast that he could do whatever he wanted, grab women “by the pussy,” but they missed the rest of his quote, in which he explicitly describes sexually assaulting a married woman:“I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn't get there. And she was married. Then all of a sudden I see her, she's not got the big phony tits and everything... I've got to use some Tic Tacs, just in case I start kissing her. You know I'm automatically attracted to beautiful. I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”He never apologized. He never showed remorse. He never admitted what he did was sexual assault.It will be a long four years for the country for too many reasons to count, but it will be even longer for millions of sexual assault survivors who must reckon with the fact that someone just like their attacker will now lead the country. His image will hang in the classrooms of our children, showing our boys and girls what consequences await those who violate another person's body, what (doesn't) happen when they tell someone.Shauna's assaults led her down a self-destructive and promiscuous path that took years of therapy to recover from. The president-elect is not a trigger for her today, but she has thought about and talked about her assaults more since his ascension, and she worries about how much progress he will reverse in the fight to end sexual violence.“I think he is normalizing sexism and rape culture, and we can't afford to let that become the norm,” she said. She hopes the strong online presence of survivors coming out and telling their stories will raise more awareness about the issue and show other survivors that recovery is possible. “Recovery from the mental and emotional damage that assault causes is painful, difficult and takes time,” she said.And the presence of a sexual assaulter on the news every day, making decisions that affect every American, can damage some of the progress survivors make.While the Access Hollywood tape is the only sexual assault admission captured on tape, other credible accusations were reported throughout the campaign—too many, from too many diverse sources, to dismiss. (See below.) And they're costly. The man who claims he will trim down the national budget has already done more than his share to add to the public health burden of sexual assault. And in fact, one of the items on the chopping block of his budget is funding for the Violence Against Women Act, which actually saves the U.S. an estimated net $16.4 billion a year.Rape is the costliest crime for both individuals and the nation, according to the Minnesota Department of Public Health and the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The average cost of being a rape victim is $110,000, which adds up to $127 billion in the U.S. each year. That's because every year, 321,500 Americans age 12 and older are sexually assaulted or raped. According to MDPH, “Annually, victims pay about $44 billion of the $57 billion in expenses for traditional crimes of violence—murder, rape, robbery, assault and abuse and neglect. Employers pay out almost $5 billion (primarily in health insurance bills), and the government—and taxpayers—bear the remaining $8 billion through lost tax revenues and Medicare and Medicaid payments.”But it is the fault of half the electorate that a man who remorselessly boasted of sexual assault was today inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, sending the message that nothing stands in the way of a sexual predator when others do not fight back against rape culture. The subtext of his slogan might as well have been, ""Make America Rape Again.""“I worked in night clubs and bars after college and had my breasts, my ass, my hair, my face and my pussy grabbed by customers,” Rebecca said. “I learned to identify the men who were most likely to get out of hand, the men who think they have a right over a woman's body. At the time it just seemed like a workplace hazard but now that I am older, that I am a mother, I am angry. I am filled with rage thinking of men like Trump pawing at me, and it sickens me to think that other men will now laugh it off as presidential behavior.”Below is a list of credible sexual assault accusations against the President-elect. The Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment. Shauna's reminder to survivors is relevant: “This is not our shame to bear, it is our attackers.”Jessica Leeds said Trump fondled her breasts and tried to get his hand under her skirt during a flight. “He was like an octopus. His hands were everywhere,” she said.Temple Taggart McDowell said Trump kissed her on the lips on two different occasions without her consent, one time in his office.Rachel Crooks was an employee in Trump's building who met him on an elevator. He shook her hand, then would not let go as he drew her in and kissed her mouth and cheek. “I was so upset that he thought I was so insignificant that he could do that,” she said.Kristin Anderson told the Washington Post that Trump moved his hand under her skirt and touched her vagina while sitting next to her.Natasha Stoynoff, a journalist for People Magazine, described an encounter with Trump at Mar-a-Lago: “We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds, he was pushing me against the wall, and forcing his tongue down my throat. Now, I'm a tall, strapping girl who grew up wrestling two giant brothers. I even once sparred with Mike Tyson. It takes a lot to push me. But Trump is much bigger—a looming figure—and he was fast, taking me by surprise, and throwing me off balance. I was stunned. And I was grateful when Trump's longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself.”Mindy McGillivray described her experience at Mar-a-Lago: “All of a sudden I felt a grab, a little nudge. I think it's Ken's camera bag, that was my first instinct. I turn around and there's Donald. He sort of looked away quickly. I quickly turned back, facing Ray Charles, and I'm stunned.''Cassandra Searles, a contestant at one of his pageants, said, “He probably doesn't want me telling the story about that time he continually grabbed my ass and invited me to his hotel room.”In fact, Trump allegedly used his pageants as a way to view and touch the naked bodies of teenagers, minors: ""He just came strolling right in,"" Dixon said. ""There was no second to put a robe on or any sort of clothing or anything. Some girls were topless. Others girls were naked. Our first introduction to him was when we were at the dress rehearsal and half-naked changing into our bikinis.""Jill Harth filed a lawsuit in 1997 against Trump which alleged the following: “After Trump business associates left, the defendant [Trump] over the plaintiff's objections forcibly prevented plaintiff from leaving and forcibly removed plaintiff to a bedroom, whereupon defendant [Trump] subjected plaintiff to defendant's unwanted sexual advances, which included touching of plaintiff's private parts in an act constituting attempted “rape.” Trump forcefully removed [Harth] from public areas of Mar-A-Lago in Florida and forced [her] into a bedroom belonging to defendant's daughter Ivanka, wherein [Trump] forcibly kissed, fondled, and restrained [her] from leaving, against [her] will and despite her protests.""",1.4309363e-07,3.2975594e-25,5.441534e-07,2.5404304e-14,3.45844e-12,1.3147353e-16

NAN,"What does right and left represent?The democrats are an extremely capitalist party. Their solution to America's disastrous healthcare system was to simply mandate insurance along with other reforms of the private system. They didn't do what a left winger would do - i.e. nationalise the provision of healthcare. It's exactly the same story with higher education. They don't really support unions a great deal. They support banks and other financial institutions almost as much as the Republicans. They tweak around the edges of America's overwhelmingly capitalist system, and outside of a handful of radicals they don't attempt to make any changes to it. They also prop up wars and conflict around the world. Basically they are a capitalist party. There's nothing wrong with that. But things that they propose that are attacked as 'too left wing' have been the standard in every developed country in the world. There's nothing ridiculously left wing about pointing that out. To give you an example regarding broad views on workers rights:* Extremely right wing: no workers' rights at all. No mandated holiday days. No union protection. No restrictions on firing staff (Republicans)* Centre/centre right: Some workers' rights. Some mandated paid holiday (e.g. 15-20 days), some union protection, some restrictions on firing staff. Mandated paid maternity leave (Democrats. See also the UK for instance)* Centre left: Lots of workers rights. Mandated paid holiday (25-35 days), strong protections for unions, very difficult to fire staff for anything other than criminality, long mandated maternity and paternity leave. (No party in the US - see centre left capitalist countries like France or Sweden for examples)* Extreme left: The workers own the means of production. Rights as such are unnecessary as they are also the owners. If you see the democrats as particularly left wing, it's more that your view is warped grossly to the right.

Cooking_Drama,"> ""You don't belong in politics because you're not a politician.""I don't think that's what this comic is saying at all.

Anyone can be a Pilot if they want to be, but you can't just wake up one day and say ""You know what? I'm going to apply to Delta Airlines' open Pilot positions today!"" I mean, you can, but Delta would deny you for not having any piloting experience.Politicians should be the same way and America should be like Delta from my example- don't allow someone to run your government without prior experience. Barack Obama was just a kid born to a single mother in Hawaii. He went to school for political science then became a Senator. Whether people liked him or not, he was qualified for the job of President. Trump is exactly like the passenger in this example. He skipped all the important steps that one would normally take to become a political leader and got people riled up enough to vote for him.

You're just making a counter point without any actual evidence at all.Obviously there are many complex causes of crime, but, like other developed countries, crime will happen (crime rates are similar) but with fewer guns there will be fewer gun crimes...

Khmer Rouge soldiers referred to Phnom Penh as ""the great prostitute of the Mekong."" (Chandler, The Tragedy of Cambodian History, 247). Ordinary citizens were moved out of the cities to live and work in the countryside as peasants in order to create the ideal communist society. The goal of converting everyone to peasants was due to the fact that this class of people was believed to be “simple, uneducated, hard-working and not prone to exploiting others.” They had lived that way for years and always managed to get by. For this reason, the Khmer Rouge called the peasants ""old people"" and considered them as the ideal communists for the new Cambodian state.> Those who lived in the cities were seen as ""new people"" and were considered “the root of all capitalist evil” by the Khmer Rouge. New people were the quintessence of capitalism and therefore the opponent of communism. No matter what their profession was - teacher, tailor, civil servant or monk - it was irrelevant. According to the Khmer Rouge, the new people had made the decision to live in the cities, proving their loyalty to capitalism. Because of this, hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were automatically branded enemies of the new communist state and were killed.Pol Pot was inspired by Mao Zedong's [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution).> Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society",3.1381068e-11,4.205848e-26,6.410153e-07,2.4129323e-14,6.279321e-10,5.896015e-15

But parading women around, briefly kissing them on the lips (isn't this a greeting in certain parts of the world?), and calling them fat ain't even close to rape.Bill Clinton had an intern blow him (while President, so talk about uneven power dynamics). He went through a civil lawsuit for it and was impeached for lying during that case. The woman who broke the scandal [received death threats immediately afterwards and had to be moved to a safe house](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/05/27/tripp/). He has also been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. And yet Clinton is remembered quite fondly around here. His accusers, who had as much proof of rape as Trump's accusers, are routinely trounced by supporters and ignored by the media. Not only is Trump's situation not unprecedented, it's precedented by the guy who was President a whole 3 Presidents ago and also the husband (by choice) of the candidate who was frequently fellated around these parts for the past couple years.So I don't buy for a second that this a serious issue for /r/politics, or more people would be more consistent on this point and call out Hillary for her continued relationship with a man who is just as ""guilty"" as Trump. I'm more than sure that it's just a convenient line of anti-Trump rhetoric, bolstered by the resurgence of political correctness and feminism, that is conveniently forgotten when the ""good guys"" do the exact same thing.

CoffeeandBacon,"People just post that Limbaugh quote out of context to make him look bad. I doubt you've even listened to the full excerpt. Isn't there a better way to disagree with or decry republicans than to smear them with dishonest piecemeal quotes?To paraphrase: He's talking about hypocrisy, and that he's frustrated that republicans are frequently strung up with claims of hypocrisy but it never attaches itself to the democrats. He is saying that it's extremely hypocritical that the left is very strong on consent as if that's the only thing that makes a sex act good or decent, when him and many others believe that there are a lot more moral standards related to sex that can make it otherwise bad or unwholesome or damaging and rape is only one of them. So for the left to ignore everything else is pretty blind and hypocritical. That's it. So, this quote is pretty stupid to me. He's not a rape advocate, he just thinks that it's hypocritical that that's the only thing people are concerned about when it comes to sex. Now these aren't my thoughts, but you can understand where he's coming from while disagreeing with him. I think that he talks in kind of a stupid, far-right manner, but if you understand what he's trying to say this quote is just a non-issue.Here's the full quote below>Okay now to this story on hypocrisy. We like talk here about hypocrisy all the time and we wring our hands and we express our frustrations; how come hypocrisy never attaches itself to the democrats and yet when it comes to republicans it has become a crime? Hypocrisy is a crime when republicans are caught with it, and yet it never even attaches to democrats. So there's a piece her called The Ugly Stench of Hypocrisy by Michael J Herd PHD, the most insightful thing I've read about the Donald Trump Sex Scandal is this…, “How Ironic then that a culture that rejects moral standards..” Make no bones about it folks, we do! “Moral standards, you stand up for moral standards you're going to be laughed out of the room! You're going to be called a prude, a Victorian, an old fuddy duddy, and old fogey, and they're going to claim you want to deny people having a good time. So, a culture which rejects moral standards, in other words anything goes. You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today? The one thing, you can do anything, the left will promoe and understand and tolerate anything as long as there is one element. Do you know wha tit is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or four o how ever many are involved in the sex act, it's perfectly fine, whatever it is.

km89,"I don't feel as though I'm misrepresenting him.

Mocking the idea of consent as if it's some stuck-up liberal fluff is itself a reprehensible statement. But the context doesn't do anything at all to alleviate that. There's no mention of ""obviously, you can't go around raping people."" There's no implication that the left it *overly* concerned with the explicit words of consent--the South Park episode with the frat guy asking for her written consent and holding out a written form comes to mind as the type of mocking argument that actually *does* make that point, but Limbaugh's words do not make that point at all. In fact, the context only *strengthens* my point.

But I can hardly imagine how it would be with someone who was actually saying ""no."" What kind of sick fuck does that?

CoffeeandBacon,"People just post that out of context to make him look bad. I doubt you've ever even listened to the full excerpt. Isn't there a better way to disagree with or decry republicans than to smear them with dishonest piecemeal quotes?To paraphrase: He's talking about hypocrisy, and that he's frustrated that republicans are frequently strung up with claims of hypocrisy but it never attaches itself to the democrats. He is saying that it's extremely hypocritical that the left is very strong on consent as if that's the only thing that makes a sex act good or decent, when him and many others believe that there are a lot more moral standards related to sex that can make it otherwise bad or unwholesome or damaging and rape is only one of them. So for the left to ignore everything else is pretty blind and hypocritical. That's it. So, this quote is pretty stupid to me. He's not a rape advocate, he just thinks that it's hypocritical that that's the only thing people are concerned about when it comes to sex. Now these aren't my thoughts, but you can understand where he's coming from while disagreeing with him. I think that he talks in kind of a stupid, far-right manner, but if you understand what he's trying to say this quote is just a non-issue.Here's the full quote below>Okay now to this story on hypocrisy. We like talk here about hypocrisy all the time and we wring our hands and we express our frustrations; how come hypocrisy never attaches itself to the democrats and yet when it comes to republicans it has become a crime? Hypocrisy is a crime when republicans are caught with it, and yet it never even attaches to democrats. So there's a piece her called The Ugly Stench of Hypocrisy by Michael J Herd PHD, the most insightful thing I've read about the Donald Trump Sex Scandal is this…, “How Ironic then that a culture that rejects moral standards..” Make no bones about it folks, we do! “Moral standards, you stand up for moral standards you're going to be laughed out of the room! You're going to be called a prude, a Victorian, an old fuddy duddy, and old fogey, and they're going to claim you want to deny people having a good time. So, a culture which rejects moral standards, in other words anything goes. You know what the magic word, the only thing that matters in American sexual mores today? The one thing, you can do anything, the left will promoe and understand and tolerate anything as long as there is one element. Do you know wha tit is? Consent. If there is consent on both or all three or four o how ever many are involved in the sex act, it's perfectly fine, whatever it is. But if the left ever senses and smells that there's no consent in part of the equation, here comes the rape police.

People didn't trust that. From that point on, everything she did (still many years before she was a member of congress) was criticized as being phoney.

Mind_Reader,">Paula JonesOf all the women, she is probably the most believable.According to Paula Jones, on May 8, 1991, Jones, then a 24 year old civil servant in the office of the Governor of Arkansas, was escorted to Clinton's hotel room in Little Rock, Arkansas where he propositioned her and exposed his penis.Although this is the behaviour of a creep, it wasn't sexual assault.The Paula Jones case went through the courts for quite some time, eventually leading to the judge dismissing it, ruling Jones had not shown she suffered damages and failed to show Clinton's actions were ""outrageous conduct.""The dismissal was appealed, and the Clinton team eventually settled, claiming they just wanted the case to be over. President Clinton was never found guilty of sexual harassment, nor did he admit to any wrong doing.>Juanita Broderick doesn't either.What? After she claimed he raped her, she continued to support Clinton's campaign for governor, and even appeared in public on his behalf. Now that in and of itself wouldn't be that unusual. However Broaddrick signed a deposition, under oath, stating that no sexual contact had occurred with Bill Clinton.So while I feel that President Clinton was a womanizer, and crossed a decency line with Jones, I don't think he is anywhere near what you're claiming him to be. > Let's be real, if the same exact situation happened to Trump you'd probably be harping on about how she was ""silenced.""

Just because they don't protest doesn't mean they're cool with it - they could be shocked and scared by you non-consensually grabbing them and just decide to wait it out until they can get away from you.There's a big difference between suddenly getting sexual with someone whom you already have a sexual relationship with, and getting sexual with someone you don't have a sexual relationship with. Apart from Trump's somewhat ambiguous words - which I think could go either way in terms of describing sexual assault - there's also the 13-19 women who've accused him of sexual assault or misconduct.

You will be lucky that they were receptive to those actions. The vast, vast, vast majority of people will not be receptive to a complete stranger kissing them in the scenario you've described. Whether it gets officially reported as a crime is a different matter. It's kind of like if you steal an expensive watch from your brother's home in order to pawn it to pay for drugs.

But you've been an asshole and taken a big risk. In my state, in my country, actions like groping a stranger with no prior indication of consent is a crime. It's called ""indecent assault"". Actions that might constitute indecent assault are: * The slightest touch / physical contact (however minimal) is sufficient to amount to an assault. This excludes touching in the course of ordinary everyday life.* The intentional touching, even over clothes, of breasts, anus, vagina or penis.* A kiss, when it has been made clear the kiss is unwanted.* Intentionally rubbing your groin against another, example; on a busy train when the other person has not given consent.Source: http://www.armstronglegal.com.au/criminal-law/offences/sexual/indecent-assault",0.61964655,3.0414516e-23,3.7445115e-08,2.1578829e-10,6.406003e-07,5.69643e-11

ReallySeriouslyNow,">almost as bad as assassinating the guy who leaked documents from the corrupt party which blatantly conspired to oust your opponent I wonder if you have any concept of how ridiculous that story is and for how many reasons. For starters, this is supposedly the story for how Wikileaks got the DNC data. Problem is, the DNC data was not a Wikileaks release. Wikileaks just rehosted it. Some angry person from the DNC didn't hand if off to a Wikileaks contact in the woods. Wikileaks literally pulled the info from another website on the internet and put it on their own. John Podesta, the person whose emails Wikileaks was the original releaser of, was not a DNC employee. His emails are not on DNC servers. An angry DNC employee does not have access to them. Seth Rich did not work in IT, had no access to DNC servers, certainly didn't have access to John Podesta's email account, and there is literally nothing indicating he was a Sanders supporter. He was planning to move to NY to work for Hillary's campaign. If he was assassinated, they did a pretty shitty job, considering they left him alive.Then there's the fact that literally nothing in the emails shows any action taken by Hillary or the DNC to ""oust"" Sanders.",4.078724e-05,5.7988267e-16,0.11043018,1.1309559e-09,2.4637939e-05,1.2401862e-11

The problem wasn't lower black turnout, the problem was the Clinton campaign's assumption that the Obama coalition would show up in the same numbers as 2012, and that they couldn't possibly lose any voters to the Republicans in the last four years. So many black voters stayed home or were denied the right to vote, a bunch of white middle class people shifted hard to the right, ten percent of the Bernie people voted third party or write-in, and the Republicans fell in line.But apparently I'm racist for saying that.

Her0_0f_time,"I didnt say anything of vote tampering. I was talking about how early on the DNC worked with the mainstream media to minimize coverage of Bernie to make it seem like he wasnt a legitimate contender even though polls had them very close. This had a major impact in the early southern states as Bernie wasnt getting enough coverage. He did much better down the line when the media coverage became more balanced. Though they still covered Clinton moreOr that time Hilary had debate questions leaked to her so that she could better prepare for debates against Bernie since she needed that to look better than him. Which would make Bernie look less prepared in front of the public.Or how about the mainstream media using super delegate counts to show how much of a disadvantage Bernie has even before the first states voted. Because undecided people generally tend to cast their vote for whoever has the greater chance of winning.Similarly, just before some of the biggest states held their election the media announced that Hillary had won because of the pledged super delegates. Which would have made many Bernie supporters in the later states not show up because their vote no longer mattered, even though that was completely untrue.Or that leaked email talking about ways the DNC can try and push Bernie out to make Hilary look good even though the DNC is supposed to remain a neutral party.Finally, the biggest issue of them all, the piss poor debate schedule that was designed to keep Bernie from being shown to the public. Most of the debates were held during off hours or when another event was going on and fewer people would be watching. Not only that, but they made it so that candidates could not show up at non DNC debates if they wanted as that would bar them from participating in the main stage debates that most of the country watched. This significantly cut down on the exposure that Bernie and many of the other early candidates recieved further supporting Hillary as she had everything to gain from fewer debates seeing as she was a historically bad candidate with historically low raitings. And the only reason she isnt the lowest rated candidate in history is because of Trump.There are more legitimate reasons for why the primaries were rigged in Clinton's favor than vote tampering.

tomdarch,"The day after the election, I tried to imagine where this might be positive. Trump is a Manhattanite so he's not rooted in a lot of the social conservatism, plus he personally has met and worked with people from all over the world. Maybe sure, he'd push tax cuts for the rich and some anti-consumer ""free market"" stuff, and that might actually stimulate the economy in the short term... Maybe he'll block the Republican social conservatives from pushing anti-gay stuff... Basically, maybe he'd position himself as neither a Republican nor a Democrat and play against both sides from the middle...But no. The White House staff and cabinet picks show that he is surrounded by people who are off the deep end of Republican politics. He hasn't made any statements during the transition that would show him to be balancing any of that. Simply the *quality* (which is to say embarrassingly low) of the cabinet picks is a problem. A guy who got a D in his college ""meat science"" class to run the Department of Energy? A Secretary of Education who literally doesn't know the difference between looking for growth vs. meeting fixed achievement goals in student testing? This stuff is absurd. On top of that, there are huge numbers of posts below the cabinet level that the incoming administration simply don't have anyone lined up to fill. Most crucial are the National Security posts that will be empty later today. Terrorists around the world are constantly trying to attack the US, and we need the best people to be continuously monitoring and countering that, but the incoming administration is fucking up that continuity. A likely part of how the 9/11/2001 attacks happened 8 months into the incoming W Bush administration is that they didn't staff up and get on top of what the previous administration was telling them about Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda group. The incoming Bush administration was forming a committee to bring major people up to speed on the threat, but the committee never met prior to September 11th. It very much looks like the Trump folks literally don't know what they are doing, and that is very scary.(There's also the fact that as badly as the Bush folks and the neo-cons abused the aftermath of 9/11/2001, Trump and his people would go much, much further beyond the Patriot Act and rounding up random Muslims. They would wildly exploit a major terrorist attack within the US for their political aims. In fact, it might be the only thing that could politically save Trump from being booted before the end of his term.)",3.7685577e-06,3.9221679e-25,1.1880103e-06,6.665319e-14,4.308509e-12,6.648232e-17

Forgive me if too personal; I'm truly curious, wondering what I'd do. My experience doesn't come close.My grandfather, a WW2 vet with a Purple Heart (he's 92), and I love each other very much, but we avoid all talk of politics. The one time we got into it, when I asked him to change the radio station on a road trip because it was ultraconservative and making me uncomfortable, it escalated into a SCREAMING match. But we forgave within an hour.He just recently was in hospital. I surreptitiously changed his tv from Fox News because I know he plays it all day long. I made eye contact with a nurse, and she whispered ""thank you."" Best not insult the people saving your life, PapPap. We didn't argue over that one.If I felt *betrayed* by my own *father*, unable to recognize the man who raised me, I think I might slowly distance myself, and if I had kids, definitely limit contact. Otherwise I'd explain exactly why I was upset, and hope he would step up as a father and at least show me respect and maybe even listen to my feelings. It'd be hard to hear him out, but fairs fair.

luminousbeing9,"Well, I haven't confronted him about it. My brother sat down and talked with him just before the election, figuring he would vote for Trump. The position my dad held at that time (I wasn't there for the conversation) was that he supported him as the disruptive candidate, and that he would just as likely turn on him if he didn't fulfill is promises.The thing is, just after the election he got into a rant about healthcare costs during Thanksgiving dinner. It was a pitched spiel about how Medicaid and Medicare make costs more expensive, and things would be better if they were eliminated, and he remembers the time when his father used to directly pay the doctor after a house call, etc. I don't know where he's getting his information, but it has completely infected his take on things.A few weeks later, after my brother discovered the blog and Twitter account, it was clear that the whole ""change candidate"" thing was a deflection, smokescreen. He's part of the Trump worship group. He's much more far gone than I had feared. We want to confront him about it, but don't know how to bring ourselves to do it. I think it's harder for my brother, since he's still trying to maintain a relationship with him. I've had my own falling out with him years back (different circumstances and reasons), and was taking small steps to rebuild since then. This revelation essentially undid all the good faith he'd built up.It's harder and harder to talk about neutral things. My brother noticed that it doesn't matter the situation, my dad and stepmom will bring up inflammatory stances at the most random and inopportune times. Like if a waiter offhandedly mentions taxes or something. And it gets really uncomfortable really fast. As much as we try to avoid these uncomfortable situations, eventually it's going to have to come to a head.When we're prepared, we'll confront him. It probably can't be an accusation, because he'll close off and shut down (I imagine). The hope is that if we express just how disappointed we are, it might trigger some reflection. I'm certainly prepared to distance myself from him if it comes to that, and if I eventually have kids they'll be kept away as well. I'll make that clear to him, and hopefully the prospect of being cut off from the future will get through to him.

Every massive ""wave"" election has been followed by a counter-election (especially mid-terms) in which checks to power are brought forth. The bigger the wave, the bigger the counter-wave. If you thought Obama's election invited a political backlash of epic proportions, you ain't seen nothing yet.

Russia has a shit ton of racism, but do you think that someone like King could actually improve things before he or she was killed? Probably not. That's a big difference with America, and something I am proud of. The cancer of racism is still alive and shooting black people in the back, but overall things are clearly better than they were two generations ago. We didn't need a bloody revolution. We didn't flip from one ethnic/racial group exploiting another to reversing the situation. For the most part, we just simply got better. We have a constitution that embodies a lot of ideals, and what we did was get closer to enacting those ideals.That same constitution gave us the framework to overcome social bigotry and have our government treat same-sex couples with the same respect as mixed-sex couples. Just as *Loving v Virginia* (which threw out laws against mixed-race marriages) was overdue, but in the end the right call, *Obergefell v. Hodges* was clearly overdue, but still the right thing to do, and we actually did it. That's another thing to be proud of.America is a nation with serious problems of fear, ignorance, hate and bigotry among large parts of the population. But we aren't completely controlled by that.

In this case, I think he had seen a lot of the political ads on TV where the focus was on bullying and kids. This seemed to resonate with him, because he also saw Trump as a bully based on those ads. This, paired with being in elementary school where the students are taught that bullying is bad caused a real emotional stir in him when Trump was elected. Like, inconsolably crying when he found out.As a parent, I had a lot of takeaway lessons from this, but I also had some good conversations with him about politics, respect, control, and bullying.

NAN,"At least I am not a fascist. If that's the moral high ground, send me to hell.In 1995, Italian novelist and philosopher Umberto Eco wrote a piece for The New York Review of Books on fascism. As part of the article, Eco listed 14 features of what he called Ur-Fascism or Eternal Fascism. He began the list with this caveat:These features cannot be organized into a system; many of them contradict each other, and are also typical of other kinds of despotism or fanaticism. But it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.Here's an abbreviated version of Eco's list:1. The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”2. The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”3. The cult of action for action's sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”4. Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”5. Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”6. Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”7. The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”8. The humiliation by the wealth and force of their enemies. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”10. Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”12. Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”13. Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”",5.587966e-06,8.706671e-22,9.694539e-07,1.2576835e-10,2.1137595e-08,9.59053e-12

lkjhgfdsamnbvcx,"Short answer? Because we grossly underestimated him, and HRC and the Dems catastrophically misread the mood of the public.I kinda think that Trump managed to turn the election into a kind of referendum on 'political correctness', and a lot of the public has an energetic disdain for that stuff. The real politics/policies hardly mattered. I think a lot of factors 'lost Hillary the elction', but maybe the most preventable/predictable was her (and her proxies/supporters) overplaying stuff like her gender ('the first female President'/'the glass ceiling'/""I'm with her""), or Trumps 'racsim' (like it or not, exactly what constitutes 'racism' varies a lot from person to person. Repeatedly conflating opposition to illegal immigration, or concerns about Islamic terrorism, with racism just pushed many middle-ground voters -or even traditional Democrat voters- towards Trump. And made them more sympathetic towards overt, hardcore racists.)I really hope the Democrats, and Dem supporters, learn from their mistakes this time around, because just yelling ""Nazi!!"" at Trump and his supporters (ie the people we should be trying to win over; name-calling is unlikely to do that) won't go any better in 4 years time than it did in November.

Everything else ( the frightened women, the power hungry boss, the fear) those are images you bring from other, very prevalent, narratives: cliches from movies and tv show, so vivid that they naturally come to mind as soon as we talk about seduction.

Shit___Taco,"What, when he says ""they let you do it"". Or the fact that he never actually did the actions he was speaking about. In this same conversation he even said ""she shut me down"" and that he accepted it and never went on to commit any actual sexual assault? I should stop having sex with my wife, because according to this rationale, even though she likes it and let's me do it, I sexual assault her multiple times a week.Then in the same form, even though Bill Clinton used his fame and power to actually have consensual sexual relations with women because they let him do it, all Deemocrats agree it is not sexual assault? This seems a bit hypocritical to me. We have an action that actually occurred, and it is agreed not to be sexual assault. Then we have the same action that did not actually occur, but you all agree Trump is guilty of actual sexual assault, because...well...""le Drumpf"". What he said was disgusting and terrible, but he didn't actually commit any sexual assault. If he is found guilty of sexual assault, then we can say he is a sexual predator who ""bragged about sexual assault"", but in the USA you are considered innocent until proven guilty. So Trump is actually innocent, despite his disgusting conversation.If you consider what his hypothetical conversation was to be sexual assault, then Bill Clinton definetly committed sexual assault and Hillary was guilty of victim blaming and shaming. We have to be consistent with our definitions and facts, and if you want to say Trump is guilty of sexual assault, you have to agree that Bill Clinton is 100% guilty of sexual assault. But Bill Clinton was found to be not guilty of sexual assault by a court. If using fame and power to have consensual sex is considered sexual assualt, Trump has only committed a thought crime and yet the left still considers him guilty. However, Bill Clinton's actual actions, even though they use the same rationale that was enough to make Trump guilty, are absolved of any crime or wrong doing. Now lets talk facts. Bill Clinton was tried and found to be not guilty by a court. Trump was never tried because he never did anything, yet you are convinced he is 100% guilty.

The simple reality is that Trump is a horrible person who has done horrible things and promotes horrible positions. He has jammed his fingers up into the crotches of unwilling women. He has simply refused to pay contractors who have done work for him. He constantly, blatantly lies. The ""unbiased, objective"" position is to oppose Trump. The ""unbiased"" thing is to condemn what he said about assaulting women, and to condemn him for having done exactly what he said he did.Equivocating or excusing or downplaying simple reality is what would be ""biased.""

But why it's not a terrible system is that instead of winning just a majority of votes the winner has to win the majority of votes in the majority of states with America being so large land wise and population wise and with such diversity it helps keep it that the winner has a more diverse supprt group.

StuporMundi18,France is the size of Texas in land area. One state. America is much larger than France so a tad harder to get around but the candidates still visit places with very small populations like 1000 people small because they need those votes in those states to win. In popular vote like how governors are chosen one major city can literally pick who runs the state even if the rest of the state doesn't want that. It's possible to do that in America too because what you don't really understand with your top 100 cities is that they have surrounding metro areas that pretty much are the same thing. Chicago has 3 million people in it while the metro area has 9 million people most of these cities also have areas like that.

It isn't going to be a good 4 years for me, because:- I care about folks having insurance and not dying because they couldn't get covered.- Facts are important to me, like the science that proves climate change is real and is being dangerously accelerated by human activity. Like how ""clean coal"" may be cleaner than traditional coal, but it's not clean.- I care about women not being grabbed at the pussy.- I care about wealth inequality, and realize that after 40 years of trickle down economics, that shit doesn't work and only serves to make the rich even richer, and the rest of us even poorer.- I care about public education not being gutted in favor of private education. Students getting the best education possible should always be more important than the ""bottom line"" at a school.- While I think we should be more vigilant about illegal immigration, the system for legal immigration should be overhauled, made to be much shorter and easier to navigate FIRST. The wall is a stupid idea that will be too expensive, and as soon as it's tunneled under, will be ineffective.- I care about us NOT persecuting people out of fear. Japanese internment happened. McCarthyism happened. Let's not return to that by persecuting muslims (though we do need to talk about how to find and keep out potential terrorists).- I care about having executive cabinet that knows what they are doing and aren't out to plunder / pummel the world to make themselves richer.- I care about having a President that has enough maturity NOT to get into schoolyard fights on Twitter about shit that shouldn't matter to the POTUS.- I care about NOT having a government that very well may be a puppet for the Russians. Holy shit.I could go on, but I suppose I've gone on too long. Divisive attitudes about people is part of why Trump won.

Q-Gravity,"I still don't understand this sentiment. Can you please elaborate on that argument?I'm a veteran who only recently became extremely involved with politics thanks to Jim Webb first, then ultimately Sanders. During the primaries, I was a total BernieBro; I donated, spread the word, everything. Simultaneously, I learned more and more about the scandals surrounding the Clintons, as well as dealing with the constant BS that came with the DNC. Trust me friend, I learned to absolutely despise the DNC and Clinton. And although she's more or less a fart in the wind now, I still feel the same way about her/DNC.Yet, even with this being the case, I positively could not rationalize voting Trump over Clinton. For me, they both were bad for America—and they both talked the big talk during their campaigning, but I didn't believe any of it. With this in mind, it makes sense to me to make a pros and cons list of the two and sadly, vote for the lesser of two evils. Looking at their credentials, credibility, past history, those they are involved with, and ultimately their qualifications (because being President is a serious job, not just a TV spot or popularity contest)—she came out on top every time. It pained me to do so, but the only logical person to vote for was Clinton.Now I'm not judging you or trying to attack you in any way, I was just giving my quick two-cents.

There is **NO WHERE** in the tape where Trump even talks about Sexual assault. When talking about the woman mentioned in the tape, Trump actually talked about consent. And how he was making moves on the woman but unable to get sex.> I moved on her, actually. You know, she was down on Palm Beach. I moved on her, and I failed. I'll admit it.Where is any sexual assault there? He clearly said he was trying to move on her, and he failed. Nothing abnormal. I've done the same with women at times where I moved on them and failed. You probably have, assuming you're a straight male. And in regards to the grab em by the pussy part, If you look at the full context, Trump was talking about how women *allowed* him to grab them by the pussy *as an example* because he was rich and famous (not that he actually did it, but he used grab em by the pussy as an example). Here's the full context.> Trump: Yeah, that's her. With the gold. I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I'm automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.> Bush: Whatever you want.> Trump: Grab 'em by the pussy. You can do anything.Now that you've seen the context, you can clearly see that this was *not* an admission to sexual assault, he was rather explaining how he can get women to do sexual acts with him/for him easily because he's rich and famous. Or just bragging. He might have been lying and not done any of that just to seem masculine. Guys do that a lot, too. ###GOOD DAY!No really, I mean it. Because you need to get un-brainwashed. You are listening to leftist talking points without any actual evidence. Take this as an important life lesson not to trust everything the MSM tells you. Do research and find the truth. Feel free to criticize Trump.

This feeling sometimes just feels like a pebble sitting in my stomach, and sometimes I can taste the acid in the back of my throat when I think too much about this. Hearing the language that Trump used in that tape and in his remarks regarding it, and the way people jumped to his defense made me feel retraumatized. I started to have flashbacks, panic attacks, nightmares. I felt like all the work that I have done in five years was undone in minutes. My mother voted for Trump. A woman who swore she wanted to kill the man who raped me voted for one who is similar. It is one of the hardest betrayals I have had to deal with in my life. I felt unprotected, I felt backstabbed, I felt powerless, I felt worthless. I do not understand how people could listen to that and vote for him. It really, truly breaks my heart.

Besides there being a large difference between those who are experts in constructing/maintaining economic systems and those who are experts at participating in them (or in his case, maybe the more accurate term would be exploiting them), if you look at his business record you will see that he is only capable of one thing: enriching himself. He accomplishes this mainly by vowing to enrich everyone around him and making lofty promises just to get in the door and make a sale. Once that is done he always falls short and makes sure to do little more then get his piece of the pie and then get out. The claim that his multiple bankruptcies were ""good business"" is completely false. It might have been good business for HIM but certainly not for the majority of people that were affected by his ventures. He is a sales man that will say whatever it takes to enrich himself, and I believe his presidency was the best sales pitch he ever threw together and we bought it.

Also, the idea that ""business is ruthless"" should only be true against your competitors, not against your partners within your organization (and even that idea is a bit overplayed. Competitors should also be respectful of each other. I'm firmly against ""take it all"" style capitalism).

TheDeadMagnet,"How on earth do you know whether or not I've been critical of Hillary's defense of her husband? I happen to think that the accusations of rape and sexual assault levied against Bill are most likely true and that Hillary's decision to ignore this for her own political gain is disgraceful, especially when she claimed to be running on behalf of all women.However, this in no way changes how I feel about the accusations brought forth against Trump, which I believe are equally likely to be true. You accuse me of accusing one side of sexual assault without giving equal time to the other. I hope that the first part of this comment will prove to you that that is not true (although I do realise there are far too many on the left who do ignore the Clinton's and their relationship to sexual assault whilst constantly haranguing Trump supporters over similar allegations made against him). It is you in fact who criticize one side without treating the other with the same scorn. Unless you prove me wrong by replying that the allegations made against Trump, if true, are equally as disgusting and unsettling as the ones made against Clinton, then I fear you'll continue to answer any questions about Trump's past with all the Clinton accusations while never admitting that Trump is accused of the same thing and therefore not better or worse, but the same.And once again, she lost, she's gone, he hasn't been president for 17 years.

If you see uncivil comments, please report them and do not reply with incivility of your own.**I get it, it's a ""civilized"" world we live in. But you have to look at how power is acquired. Not given, not gifted, not awarded. Taken, Seized, Grabbed. These are not peaceful words. Power is not something that is granted to anyone, it's something that is taken via force. Through the imposition of ones will upon another.Sexual Assault. It's not a very intimidating phrase is it? Because you don't want oppressed people to have access to intimidating language. Rape got too complicated to use, and it started to include to many things. And it's such a hard word, and it makes it difficult to see the VIOLENT FUCKER who committed it as anything less than a VIOLENT FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT. So instead of that ugly word Rape, lets use Sexual Assault for all but the most heinous of actions. And instead of Rapist, lets use Offender. In fact lets label it as a SEXUAL OFFENSE, that's right up there with sounding as bad as a TRAFFIC VIOLATION. Shit, that language still might be too rough, maybe we can call it an UNWANTED SEXUAL ADVANCE.The problem is words don't exist that describe how bad it is. Because those who are willing to impose their will on others will work tirelessly to discredit and erode the meaning of any words used that may give power to those whom they oppress.So I propose a new vernacular. From now on when you would use any word to describe any kind of Sexual Assault, or Sexual Offense... use the phrase HATEFUCK instead. And when describing the person who would do such a thing, they should be called a HATEFUCKER. And under no circumstances, under no cloud of censorship should you be concede to anything less than using the most ugly, despicable language possible.Because you will be asked to ""Be Civil"". FUCK CIVILITY. Anyone who wants to see HATEFUCKING as civil is not an ALLY they are an ENEMY. They are not concerned with your best interests. They are not your friend. THEY ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SURRENDER.CIVILITY : 1.) Formal politeness and courtesy in behavior or speech2.) Polite remarks used in formal conversationAnyone who wants to talk about one person HATEFUCKING another person stripping away all of their DIGNITY and trying to destroy them in the most gruesome way possible in a CIVIL manner has no desire to change anything. They want to suppress, they want to avoid, they want to escape the problem.Do not let this happen. These people are trying to hold you down. They want you to remain weak.

chernoblechild,"Do You Know Someone Suffering From Trump Unacceptance & Resistance Disorder (TURD)?TURD is a pattern of pathologically dissociative and psychotic behavior, first observed in the late hours of November 8th 2016, and increasing in severity with passing time.Sufferers of TURD often exhibit pronounced cognitive dissonance, sudden bouts of rage, rioting, and uncontrollable crying.People with TURD are characterized by a persistent unwillingness to accept that Donald Trump is going to Make America Great Again.TURD Is caused by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States of America. For many, both in America and worldwide, this was a shocking and unexpected outcome; their preferred news sources having failed to inform them that the alternative candidate was a criminal parasite.Research is ongoing, but TURD appears to correlate closely with some of the following environmental and behavioral factors:* Membership in the Democratic Party* Identifying as a Feminist* Currently enrolled in college, and/or Possession of a Liberal Arts college degree* Living in a densely populated metropolitan area* Massive student debt* Spotty or non-existent work historyPatients with TURD are very resistant to treatment, and dangerous in large groups. Any possibility of treatment requires that they be separated from their hive-mind support apparatus; they cannot begin the process of accepting reality in the presence of encouragement towards delusion and irrationality. Separation may require the assistance of law enforcement.If you have a friend or loved one suffering from TURD, urge them to seek treatment. Together we can beat this scourge, and Make America Great Again.I really don't think treatment is possible only time may heal.

TheDeadMagnet,"""I did try and fuck her. She was married… I moved on her like a bitch"" If you actually read this quote I've just pasted directly from the transcript of the tape you will see it is a clear admission of him making a sexually motivated advance against a married woman. ""I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss.""Once again, here he is not saying that he could kiss random women if he wanted to, he is clearly stating that this is something he does, and apparently quite regularly since he says them, not her.""You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.” While this isn't him directly stating that he has grabbed a woman by her vagina, it still shows clearly how he thinks about women. To him, they are objects of sexual power that he has a right and privilege to fondle and abuse. You should also notice that at no point during the conversation does Trump clarify that these are hypothetical scenarios or that he had consent when he done them. I don't know for a fact whether or not Trump actually done the things he said, or if he was simply trying to boast in private to a z-list celebrity radio DJ about how he can do whatever he wants with women, but either way this seems to me a very frightening insight into the mentality of the president.",3.9595558e-05,2.1886843e-26,5.634139e-10,1.1793824e-12,1.2912892e-09,4.386317e-13
