StewofPuppies,"This is because of mis-representation of information in news articles. Specific bee species might be endangered and their numbers ARE dwindling. However, honey bees (average bees you see assuming you live in the same place I live in) are doing perfectly fine. Well... FINE is overstating it. THey're doing OK. Obviously due to climate change, some parts of the world will be affected which will affect these bees. Pesticide use and other chemical treatments as well.The endangered bees in particular started showing up again around my house which means the endanger label is likely largely regional depending on how accommodating the climate is to these bees.A huge portion of sensationalism that convinced people ""all bees"" are endangered is just that; sensationalism.

StewofPuppies,"Don't be so sure this is a human exclusive characteristic. What you are describing modern people label as ""modern parasites of nature."" Primarily the focus has mainly centered on people but more and more observation with highly social animals/predators like orca or chimpanzees show this same destructive and almost 'evil' characteristic to ring true in ANY intelligent life form.In fact they actually DID observe a warrior tribe of chimpanzees that hunted, killed, decapitated/mutilated, and cannibalized on neighboring territory monkeys. They waged war and basically literally use a very primitive and almost indigenous strategy of warfare where formations/spacing/intervals are used. They expand territory and will cannibalize on other monkeys like monsters but when the fighting is over, they immediately turn into amicable/lovely chimps to each other.Dolphins, humpbacks, etc also kill/rape brutally.When we look at these animals, who seemingly possess the same morally corrupt violence we humans share, it's becoming clear that this isn't exclusively a human trait. It is a trait of intelligent life. Morality and ethics is a human made concept. Without human kind, rules of Darwinism and laws of survival of the fittest would be the absolute law we obey. Meaning killing off competition's offsprings so your offspring will thrive is not out of the question.We excuse animals because we developed moral code and accepted them while animals might not grasp that kind of concept. But it seems certain animals that are highly sociable and apex predators are not all that different from us. Period. These warrior group of chimpanzees literally reflected what indigenous war-mongering tribe would look like.Anyways I just thought this was interesting read. Maybe you might disagree. It kind of shows that human beings aren't this evil parasitic thing; this is actually just how survival of the fittest is and we see this evident in many other examples. None just has evolved as highly as humans have. But if given the chance, I believe other species of animals might one day get there and even wage war/despicable things that we shake our heads to... because again. Morality/ethics is a man made concept. If we never evolved to this level of intelligence, the concept of rape or murder being wrong wouldn't even exist. Ofc none of this excuses or justifies committing those acts either.",0.0005716967,4.3506208e-07,0.5849052,0.00017177731,0.0060602073,2.6825498e-06
bizaromo,"For one, [Dennis Van Englesdorp](https://www.vanengelsdorpbeelab.com/faq.html), an etymologist who studies CCD (colony collapse disorder) and runs the annual US honeybee colony loss counts.> **Are honey bees endangered? Are they going extinct?**> In short: no. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a species of bee that was introduced to the United Stated by European colonists in the 1600's for honey. The honey bee is the species of bee that beekeepers manage for honey and crop pollination in both Europe and North America; their population is large and worldwide. Because we depend so heavily on the pollination services provided by honey bees, their health status and colony numbers are intensively monitored by researchers. This monitoring effort provides information about honey bee colonies in the United States over many years, allowing trends to be easily visualized. This monitoring effort has allowed to visualize the recent honey bee health crisis; rates of colony losses have been high in recent years and heavy losses place enormous financial strain on beekeepers. But, the overall number of honey bee colonies in North America has been relatively stable over the last two decades because beekeepers have been able to replace their losses by splitting colonies and installing new packages of honey bees. In conclusion, yes, honey bee colonies are dying every year, but because beekeepers can anticipate and replace those losses, the total number of honey bee colonies in the United States is currently stable. So, why then, are there news articles talking about bees being endangered?> What most people don't know is that there are many thousands of wild, native bee species world-wide. In North America it has been estimated that there are about 4,000 species of native bees and the state of Maryland alone is home to more than 430 species of native bees. These native bees include things like bumble bees, carpenter bees, leaf cutter and mason bees, sweat bees, miner bees, and digger bees. These native bees are also important pollinators, and contribute valuable pollination to both crops and many wild flower species. However, most of these pollinators have not been monitored closely like honey bees are and recently, scientists have realized that some of these bee species are facing similar issues to honey bees. For example, the rusty-patched bumble bee (Bombus affinis), one of the 46 species of bumble bee found in North America, used to be a common species, found throughout the Northeastern United States. The rusty-patched bumble bee declined rapidly in 1996 and since then has rarely been seen anywhere in its former range. Because of this population decline, scientists have proposed putting this species on the Endangered species list. > Because there are so many bees in North America and most people are broadly unfamiliar with them, the word “bee” is used loosely and can be used for honey bees at times and other for native bees. Which can be confusing and potentially alarming when “bee” is followed by phrases like: “endangered” or “going extinct.” Before panicking, it is important to look at which species of bee the article is talking about. **Honey bees are not currently close to being endangered and therefore are not close to becoming extinct but this is not true for all native bee species.**",4.5523982e-14,1.4534244e-26,5.926814e-09,3.2675488e-15,6.131448e-11,3.1879363e-16
threebellies,"Honey bees are being wiped out and experiencing colony collapse in places like North America, and are being pushed out in some cases by the more aggressive Africanized honey bees. If the pollinators collapse in a agriculturally important area, oh let's say the Central California valley. Such an event would send shockwaves through food markets, and suddenly apples and oranges are 10 dollarydoos a piece and it may take years to re-establish pollinators in that area artificially.Sitting around claiming we shouldn't be concerned about the collapse of bee populations in North America is ridiculous.

mira_,"> I know China can build great stuff, but that is minuscule to the amount of cheap crap they produce. You still don't understand.

China makes for a useful scapegoat but US consumers were already preferring Sony to Phillips for their TVs, and US businesses were already preferring Canon to Xerox for their copiers. In fact, Xerox's business was basically built on mediocre quality and expensive service contracts. Once Canon got up to speed, they crushed Xerox on quality and the service contract business dropped in price. Yes, American companies are significantly better at design than Chinese companies today. But we're talking strictly about manufacturing. Wages for Chinese factory workers has been increasing significantly, which has created their huge middle class who want to buy American goods. Eventually they'll become leaders in Design, which is where the most money is anyways.And this isn't even to mention German manufacturing who, as far as I've read, are the only ones able to consistently keep a high level.

However...>Yes, American companies are significantly better at design than Chinese companies today.Designing a product is difficult. Manufacturing a product is not as difficult. Assembling a product is not difficult at all. You're basically saying that the US can master the most difficult part of a manufacturing process, but has trouble with the easier parts of the process. We can design, engineer, and draw a plan for amazing products. According to a lot of people here though, we can't figure out how to put the design together. Somehow China has mastered this, and pays people low wages to perform this work. America however giving people high wages for the same work, would not have the same quality outcome, and would in fact have lower quality. If US companies could pay their employees $1 a day instead of $12 a day, you honestly don't believe that the quality would skyrocket for US manufactured appliances? >China makes for a useful scapegoat but US consumers were already preferring Sony to Phillips for their TVs, and US businesses were already preferring Canon to Xerox for their copiers.Sony and Canon both released their products in the 70's. The US began outsourcing to China in the 70's. Xerox and Phillips manufactured in the US, starting in the late 50's. You don't find it coincidental that Sony and Canon [or any manufacturer for that matter] made good products in the 70's, but not earlier? You don't see a correlation between what Xerox and Phillips paid the American workers, vs what Sony and Canon paid their Asian workers at the time? The idea was invented, and designed in the US. It was eventually made in China, and for the best case scenario we'll assume that they didn't steal the designs. Yet nobody here seems to think that China's low pay wages had any influence on these Chinese companies taking over the market? Someone is going to have to dumb down this explanation, because I'm not getting it. Seriously, if I'm wrong, please explain it to me. The explanations so far are ""It's not only because they pay their workers slave wages, but it's because they do a very good job at it too"". I'm not being sarcastic. I have no idea how you can tell me the history of Sony and Canon, while simultaneously arguing against how Sony and Canon became rich in the first place. They became more powerful than Xerox and Phillips specifically because of how little they paid people. The west engineers products. The east copies the engineering designs, and makes a replacement with cheap labor. This is how the world has worked for the last few decades, and how it works currently.

Jaerba,"Design and manufacturing and fundamentally different tasks, that require different cultures and mindsets. Dividing them into easy and hard is wrong.No, Canon and Sony crushed the best of Xerox and Phillips in defective parts per million (one of the primary quality standards) and it is almost entirely because of Japan's quality revolution - TQM, etc. The products from Xerox and Phillips' heyday were the best at their time and satisfied the customer at the time. Then Japan adopted/created modern quality concepts and customer expectations rose and what Xerox/Phillips built were now inferior. Copiers are products that can last for 10+ years. All the previous Xerox copiers, which were built in the US, became too costly to maintain and broke down too often.> You don't find it coincidental that Sony and Canon [or any manufacturer for that matter] made good products in the 70's, but not earlier? You don't see a correlation between what Xerox and Phillips paid the American workers, vs what Sony and Canon paid their Asian workers at the time?No. Sorry to say but you are clueless on this. Xerox and Phillips thought exactly what you're thinking, which is what drove them to try to compete with Canon and Sony on price, and this is what killed them. They were wrong. Yes, Japanese manufacturing beat American manufacturing on price at the time. But it also won on quality and lead time.http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/history-of-quality/overview/total-quality.html> Japan's strategies represented the new “total quality” approach. Rather than relying purely on product inspection, Japanese manufacturers focused on improving all organizational processes through the people who used them. As a result, Japan was able to produce higher-quality exports at lower prices, benefiting consumers throughout the world.>American managers were generally unaware of this trend, assuming any competition from the Japanese would ultimately come in the form of price, not quality. In the meantime, Japanese manufacturers began increasing their share in American markets, causing widespread economic effects in the United States: Manufacturers began losing market share, organizations began shipping jobs overseas, and the economy suffered unfavorable trade balances. Overall, the impact on American business jolted the United States into action.> At first, U.S. manufacturers held onto to their assumption that Japanese success was price-related, and thus responded to Japanese competition with strategies aimed at reducing domestic production costs and restricting imports.

So I see your point about America digging its own grave, but still don't see that as a reason to say that we can't reach the quality levels that China produces. Reaching Japanese quality isn't the same goal as reaching Chinese quality. China on average produces low quality products. For example, most of our products at the company I work for are produced in Japan. We have some produced in Mexico, in Taiwan, and in Indonesia. Primarily Japan though. We tried using Chinese manufacturers three times, and all three times they failed the quality test (defective parts per million as you stated). Three completely different parts, and different manufacturers.So I was definitely wrong about Sony/Canon as I figured they were Chinese. However the evidence I've seen points to China taking over the US market after outsourcing became the new craze. The direct reason for that was cost. We could afford to engineer products here, manufacture them elsewhere, and sell good products at a comparable rate to US citizens.If we didn't outsource, and invested in our own economy instead, who is to say that we wouldn't have kept up decent quality?I just have a hard time believing that we can complete the task of engineering complex products, but would fail to compete in the simplest part of the process which is manufacturing them without cost being the sole reason.",1.3523776e-12,1.1799984e-28,7.081362e-11,1.0408871e-15,5.4766543e-12,1.1622654e-16

In general if you're doing a high run, low cost product, it's better to set up a plant in those countries. You'll have a longer runway and lower flexibility, but it'll be significantly cheaper. If you're doing a small run, you'd do it in China as it's much easier to get those kinds of orders up and running, and they're better at accommodating custom jobs. But again, that speaks to it not being such a cheap job.Yes, low quality goods are made in China but only because of setup barriers.

China's poor and middle class do get jobs, but Americans get goods and it frees up workers for industries that the US does better in than China and for jobs (like welders) that can't yet be exported.2) we don't buy Chinese goods with Chinese Yuan. We buy them with US dollars. Last I checked, China hasn't switched currencies to US dollars.

We find that industries where the threat of tariff hikes declines themost experience greater employment loss due to suppressed job creation, exaggerated job destructionand a substitution away from low-skill workers. We show that these policy-related employment lossescoincide with a relative acceleration of U.S. imports from China, the number of U.S. firms importingfrom China, the number of Chinese firms exporting to the U.S., and the number of U.S.-China importer-exporterpairs.This paper's focus is on how the elimination of uncertainty around trade policy has affected jobs, not so much the effect of tarrifs themselves. Although it does state when the risk of tariff hikes decreased that job loss went up, none of this takes into account Chinese retaliation. It's all about making temporary Normalized Trade Relations (NTR) Permanent (PNTR), and therefore eliminating speculation on future tariffs. If both sides increase tarriffs on steel, then steel prices go up everywhere, and manufacturing industries that use steel will be forced to eliminate jobs eventually.I think there's good reason countries go to NTR instead of fighting tariff wars. They just don't work because of escalation. Also NTR include tariffs on goods both countries agree to, so it's not like we have no tariffs on China.Addressing your last point, if tariffs have little effect on imports, wouldn't increasing tarrifs not increase jobs?

Forristal,"Industrial lubricant scientist checking in.In truth, this one mostly doesn't matter. China has a number of lubrication manufacturing sites that produce stuff that's pretty much every bit as good as the American equivalent. The basestocks are a little different (because they typically use what can be refined locally), but the overall quality available from a Chinese manufacturer won't change much. As a result, most Chinese companies probably use asia-manufactured lubricants already.There will be an odd case where, for example, ExxonMobil might only manufacture a particular product in an American plant (generally more true for greases than oils across the industry), but a Chinese company would easily be able to find a local replacement.I couldn't say how prevalent this situation might be, so I can't comment on how much this might hurt an American-based company, but I suspect it won't be common.",7.3476885e-13,7.091711e-31,5.5240847e-12,1.1363772e-16,6.9826e-13,3.624522e-17

Fortunately the engineer's team has a solution, but it would involve swapping out a key part with a hard to source part, which itself would require part of the manufacturing plant to be rearranged. Now that might be a massive problem with little solution in the US, but in China it's fucking Monday. They'd have the workers up and out of their dorms ready to get to work within 15-minutes. The ""hard to source"" part could easily be located or fabricated in any one of the nearby thousands of other factories within an hours drive. The plant itself is robust and flexible, so changing the assembly design at the last minute isn't just easy, it's a common occurrence that they are used to dealing with. Do you need some type of specialist to help with the design? There's probably about 10,000 to choose from at a moments notice in every conceivable area of expertise, whereas in the US you'd be lucky to find even a handful in a ""large"" city.

HeresiarchQin,">My only concern is that people will end up blaming china instead of trumpUnfortunately that is what I expect to happen. You see how many people already complain that ""China deserves US tariffs because they never play fair""? Now anti-China supporters will have extra ammo to use to blame China being a dick by not opening the borders to the US.What a lot of people may not understand is, some of these produce from US are not even irreplaceable. A LOT of countries want to do business with China and never even had the real chance, until now. Take the meat industry for example: a lot of countries want to export beef/pork to China. China of course does not open these markets to everyone. Only those that are cooperative and friendly would be allowed. Last year Uruguay started to export beef to China. This year, Portugal pork will also soon enter the Chinese market. Now with the trade war with US going on, I would imagine it will be a great opportunity for literally all other countries except the US to try get China to open up their meat markets for other countries in order to fill the void created by US. What baffles me is how Trump has been destroying all the relationship with their trade partners without even a good alternative set up. I mean, has he considered where he would export his abundant beef, corn, oranges to? Russia? Or just let US consume them all by themselves?

Jobs won't be here immediately so everyone pays more and works less. Also, a lot of jobs we are taking from China will be replaced by machines because costs of production are Chinese labor<automation<US labor.

lballs,"> They have the ability to dick us harder than we can dick them.That is what this thread is about. You wrote about how the US economy will be hurt. I agree with a few of your points and yes it will be hurt. China will be hurt much worse. China losing nearly 25% of its exports would be much worse to its economy than the US losing nearly 5% of exports. Now most of your points are treating this like its US import tariffs on the world but this is completely focused between China and the US. I agree, tariffs against the world to bring manufacturing to the US would be catastrophically disastrous. What these tariff threats have already done is driven companies to seek manufacturing in other places with equally cheap labor. China's primary driving factor of their appeal is the cheap labor and relatively stable environment. While replacing Chinese labor overnight is not possible, recovery would be rather easy and consumers would barely notice. Not sure if China will fare as well losing the billions in specialized imports that are much harder and sometimes impossible to source from other nations.

Whether you think it's a good thing or not... American corporations have been moving manufacturing to China for over 30 years now in order to increase profits and insure Americans can buy lots of cheap/low cost stuff. Over that 30 years, it's no surprise got pretty fucking good at building factories for a wide variety of products. You can't just snap your fingers and create specialized factories for any product you want in other countries because you Trump decided he wants to be an asshole to China. Yes it's true that many ""low-tech"" goods are now made in other countries, especially South Asia... but that's definitely not the case for more specialized products like Iphones. If you read about the capabilities of the Foxconn factory that make the Iphone, they are fucking staggering. It took Foxconn many years, billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of workers to get the point that they are right now. I've read that even if you ignored labor costs, even if America wanted to create a factory on par with Foxconn it would take many billions of dollars in subsidies and at least 5-10 years just to build a similar factory........and that's still ignoring alot of other factors, like price and labor of construction, access cheap raw materials and supply lines, expertise in running and managing a factory of that scale etc etc... **My point is, there are many products produced in China that we simply won't be able to find replacements for in other countries** **On the other hand, China can easily find other sources of many of the agricultural products they buy from America... It's not like we are the only country capable of making soybeans** **The real danger is that China will simply just establish alternative trade agreements and supply lines for the products it currently importants from the United States... and once this tariff trade war bullshit is over, they will have no fundamental need to go back to purchasing from us... Other countries could easily follow suit and the result will be that many American exports have been permanently diminished if not totally wiped out **Trump is not only fucking the global economy with these Tariffs, he's especially fucking over the United States' economy and American consumers, but most of all he's completely fucking over the job creators and workers in the red states** Pure fucking idiotic hubris that's fucking everyone.",0.9237212,6.620105e-09,0.99544597,2.6488632e-07,0.0019857066,3.0107658e-10

The US workers demand higher pay, want benefits, want to feel needed by a company, they want to do good work, but want more recognition than just a paycheck.Third World countries don't have really even governmental regulations that protect people, and the wages are so low, it becomes next to impossible for a company to compete, unless they do the same.Which is where we are today.

I_inform_myself,"So, this comes from knowledge from a 500 level course I took in college. Which was titled Modern Mexican History.Mexico, has always been behind the US and Canada in terms of economic prosperity, but they were self sufficient.With the passing of NAFTA, all of the USA, Canada and Mexico were changed drastically. Canada probably has fared the best, but this was because they already had higher wage jobs, and good relations with the USA.Mexico on the other hand didn't fare to well. NAFTA took advantage of two big things in Mexico. Cheap labor (very very very low cost of living in Mexico, and much less regulation than the USA), and a lot of agricultural land to plant cash crops on.Economically, NAFTA didn't really help the Mexican families paycheck, in fact, it caused them to be less self-sufficient, especially in areas that had factories built by American companies. Due to the more lax regulations, and lower wage requirement, companies in the USA started moving factories south of the border. What was supposed to improve diversification in the North American economy was really the masked to allow US companies to utilize the cheap work force to make products and make more money without regard to what it caused back home in the US or in Mexico.Culture changes hit much bigger with the agriculture side of NAFTA. Mexico could now grow ""Cash crops"" and sell to the USA without tarriffs, or heavy taxes. Well Mexico had a very diverse background of crops. Millions of acre went from certain crops grown by individual families, to family farms being turned into industrial farms to make corn, soy or wheat. This really hurt the culture, since within communities, certain families would plant certain crops, and trade with other families during harvest. With industrial farming replacing thins, there was no diversification created in North America, just cheap crop at the expensive of Culture, and self-sufficiency.NAFTA was not a good plan. It hurt both America and Mexico (it really didn't affect Canada too much). But to this day still leaves Mexico Scarred, especially because of the loss of their diverse agriculture for cash crops to be shipped to the USA.",2.4549074e-10,1.3425017e-26,6.0996536e-10,1.6322047e-14,3.190329e-11,2.3902704e-15

To do so, they needed to secure their victory in the senate and escape pinishment for the invasion/hostage situation. Their solution was to force the Queen to sign the treaty legalizing their invasion (somehow). Maul was sent because the Queen could not be captured by ordinary forces (she had Jedi bodyguards). Palpatine leveraged Amidala's escape to secure the Chancellorship, but that was a backup plan (leveraging the chaos to become Chancellor was the plan, using the Queen's presence was improvisation). Once the Queen decided to return to Naboo before the Senate could decide the fate of her planet, a new window opened for capturing her and forcing her to sign the treaty. Maul was sent to stop the Jedi guards so that the Trade Federation forces could capture the Queen. Anakin's lethal spinning destroyed the control ship though, and the TF had no other forces to prevent themselves from being captured. Palpatine lost two pawns that day because his sith apprentice (pawn 1) got too cocky and because the TF (pawn 2) was defeated by a child.

FearMe_Twiizted,"I have no idea where you're getting your info. Hillary has been publicly owned since bill gave her a job. She literally was involved with watergate that's how far back her corruption record goes. How is kicking Russian ambassadors out of the country multiple times “sucking Putin's dick” I'll never know. I don't even think you have access to free press where you live. Europe is censoring a lot of news. That's how far off your statements are. You saying it's stupid easy to make fun of us, but you have no idea what you're talking about. Just about everything you just said is completely outdated information. Muellers first find was the trump Russia dossier. WHICH HE THEN FOUND OUT WAS PAID FOR AND CREATED BY THE DEMPCRATIC PARTY AND HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP JUST VAGUE MENTIONS OF HIS NAME. So the whole reason he started the investigation was on a lie. And what proof has he found? I just read an reticle today about him saying trumps not a criminal which means they have found literally nothing. One more thing, I don't know if you know this but CNN spent 90% of its air time smashing trump. Only 10% left to Hillary and other stories. Even with real damaging shit coming out about Hillary. Wait I almost forgot, her biggest donator was time warner cable. And who owns cnn? Time warner cable. Funny how that one company can reach so many people and push their own agendas. Which is one thing trump wants to stop. Sure trump isn't perfect. He's definitely not my ideal president. The only thing I want is some one who's going to get something done. If trump is firing people, to me it looks like he's looking for some one who will get the job done. There's that nut job lady pushing for gun control for like 30 years named Nancy pelosi or some shit. How are you going to let some get paid day in and day out to spend 30 years FAILING. Dems should of fires her and got some one who could get the job done and things might be different. And that's what Hillary has done. Spent 30 years failing the people. She has not been apart of anything real. How has she been in public office for 30 years and not accomplish anything and still move up the ladder? I'm not voting for that person. All she has done is the equivalent of suck her bosses cock for a promotion. Trump may not have many policies but for only 2 years as a politician? He's already doing better than Hillary's entire career. Not to mention trumps career is a massive fucking success. The only thing Hillary is better at, is playing the political game. It's not about how good your policies are, it's about how bad you make the other person look. And she does that real well. But trump played the political game AND the electoral college game. He had rallies sometimes twice a day all over the place while Hillary had maybe one a week in her height of rallying and was purely surfing the political game to win. But she under estimated him and failed once again. Sorry I don't want an incompetent person in office who can't beat a “tv Star” or a “business monster” or what ever other insults tickle your fancy. Just know that your party was dumb enough to lose to trump. I didn't touch on one thing I wanted to. If you watch his beginning rallies, the first few after him saying he was running, he talked about Russia and fake news before anything even happened. He said this was going to be what happened. He's been one step ahead of all that shit and been very public about it. I think the only thing that's caught him off guard is Danny summers or what ever.

redditusersmostlysuc,"Yes, I could go on for paragraphs but here are just a few.1. Allowing people to live in their RVs parked along the road to Alki Beach. There is a law that people can't park their vehicles for more than 3 days. Seattle City Council wants to circumvent this law and ever proposed that if a vehicle is towed that the city has to pay the owner back for the towing and impound fee so that in essence the city would stop towing so they wouldn't have to pay the fee. So don't fix the law, just try to get around it.2. The Seattle City Council passed a law allowing people to put up tent cities wherever they wanted to. There was an outcry because tent cities would be allowed ANYWHERE. City parks, sidewalks, etc. The council amended the law.3. There are tent cities all over the place near downtown Seattle. There are laws in place to keep people from just camping in open spaces, but nobody is enforing them. Now we have a HUGE homeless problem, drug problem, vandalism/theft has drastically increased near these tent cities, tons of garbage, and my wife does not feel safe walking alone at night now. Yet if people put up a tent city next to the mayors house or city councils homes they would be cleared out immediately.4. The city has filed 30+ lawsuits against the policies of the Trump Administration. They are spending more time and money (massive amounts of money) fighting policies than just making policies and governing the people of Seattle.5. We are a sanctuary city. This is total crap. When a federal agency asks for information on a someone that has been arrested, give them the information. Why all of this fighting and wasting of taxpayers (my) money over stupid things like this. If the person gets deported they were here illegally so makes sense. See point #1, fix the law, don't try to get around it.6. Drug shoot up facilities are being put in place. Like to do drugs? Great! Come shoot up at the Seattle City Drug House and then have a place to sleep and eat when you are done! Oh, and it will be in a neighborhood somewhere near where people live, even better!These are just some of the great ideas and politics I live with on a daily basis.

redditusersmostlysuc,"Dude, way to jump to conclusions. Think this shows how open minded (not) you are. My viewpoint is don't setup places for them to do it. I know it happens but do I really want to provide them a place to do it? No. These sites are about saving people from overdoses with one or two success stories coming out of them from thousands of people using them. Again, goes to do I think the government should be providing these types of services? The answer is no. Provide shelter (where a person has to be clean and sober, no drinking and no drug use allowed), provide assistance in the form of cash, mental health, job assistance and education assistance. Do not setup a site for them to do their drugs. The issues with these sites (at least the one going into Seattle) is that they don't have the other support pillars in place so they will just be a place to use drugs. The arguments made about these facilities are the same that are made about the tent cities, give people a place to go and put them in touch with support systems and it will be better. The tent cities have not been better and crime has increased. Residents are frustrated (https://hpacinfo.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/hpacmyerswayencampment-2018.pdf) and the city has not responded or added resources.

As for moral high ground, you're still picking the side that defends people who shoot children, and which provides them with all the necessary procedures to do so. I'd say that it makes me smug, but unlike you, I'm not someone who can enjoy a dead kid every now and then. As for gun control effecting minorities far more than whites, I'll simply say show me the stats. And make sure that wherever you provide happens to control for gang violence and inner city violence in general. It should also probably control for state, education, and other such things, but I'll leave the harder bits out for you. In case you weren't aware, there's been a law for a long time preventing the government from studying gun violence, so it's going to be pretty difficult for you to support your case. You absolutely have a right to self preservation, but are you seriously saying that a gun is equivalent to self preservation? If you're getting mugged, pulling out a gun will likely get either you or the mugger killed. If anything, it invites death, as the moment a gun comes out it becomes kill or be killed for the assailant. Lastly, you're the one attempting to discredit my arguments by calling me a nazi. Now you've made the mistake of the fallacy fallacy. You think that I've used the character assassination fallacy, and therefore have discredited my argument. While I admit I have been accusing you of supporting child murder (which you totally are). However, I have not used that to actually discredit your argument.

No judgement - genuinely want to understand the specifics. Thanks,2.775093e-13,4.8346926e-29,9.623293e-12,2.6676689e-15,3.6478712e-11,1.6172946e-15
bopp0,"I'm a specialty crop farmer, industries like dairy and grains get subsidies but specialties (fresh fruits and veggies etc.) do not get help. I'm also in an industry in which harvesting is not mechanized at all so it is all done through legal migrant labor which is very expensive. After FSMA was passed, the amount of regulatory bodies we had to answer to increased, the amount of inconsistencies between them, and how unknowledgeable and ununderstanding (? Haha) they are about our industry is very depressing, frustrating, and scary. I couldn't begin to explain all of it but a good little read on the subject is a New York Times article [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/business/picking-apples-on-a-farm-with-5000-rules-watch-out-for-the-ladders.html) . Thank you for your nice response! I'm not trying to upset anyone with the things I say, I just experience the realities of being an up-and-coming medium scale farmer every day and have an intimate opportunity to talk with people who have been farming for 50+ years.",2.34407e-11,1.0832221e-24,1.4614207e-09,1.7109185e-13,7.019146e-10,6.8830534e-14

EmporioIvankov,It *almost* seems like the issue is they have to pay them a fair wage due to regulations...I'm just commenting here so I can see the actual answer later.,5.4679834e-11,2.6804136e-27,1.6119434e-10,7.0761497e-15,6.5484987e-12,7.8736207e-16
Ruefuss,"I agree to an extent, but its also the customers willingness to pay. I wonder how people would react to significant rises in fruit and vegetable costs? We already cant stand weird looking fruits and vegetables. God forbid we pay a few cents more to buy the “perfect” ones on the shelves. Pickers need to be paid living wages and food needs to be safe to eat. Regulations are necessary. But the growers are often eating their profit margins in the process, and those margins are already fairly small.",3.7328078e-13,4.3098667e-30,5.5150755e-11,3.2585723e-16,6.2518276e-12,4.577755e-17
bopp0,"This answer is pretty accurate. Where I live there is no labor force for unskilled jobs. Most people view agricultural labor as too difficult, not paying enough, and some even believe it's beneath them. So since the 70s my farm has utilized the H2A program and hired legal workers from Jamaica. This forces us to pay the Adverse Affect Wage Rate which is currently about $12.83 and well above minimum wage. Not much of a problem except it takes about 150 people to pick the crop working 12+ hour days every day. And the way the program works, anyone local that works the same job must also make the same wage. So 90% of our workers must make at least that. 100 of the men stay for only 10 weeks during harvest. Another 20 stay for 6 months. Another 20 stay for 9 months. We provide all housing and amenities while they are here.The tough thing about ag work is it is very physical, you are out in the heat and the cold and the dust and the rain and no matter what when that crop is ready you have to do whatever it takes to get it in. 9-5 work days are right out. We work from 7am or earlier until everything is safely put away at the end of the day. It's also difficult because we and many other farms experienced devastating hail loss AGAIN. So we rely on insurance to pay bills because apples with hail marks on them are unsaleable by federal grading standards. However, insurance only pays out when we can prove a “lot” (or one farm location) is packed and shipped. Problem is, different cultivars are harvested at different times and then put away in sealed rooms, so we will only get pay out once we've sold the entirety of our years' crop. Which means we have very little income until then because of the nature of our crop insurance, we can only sell the good fruit as low grade and don't get the money it's worth. ALSO in my industry, we do not determine the prices we sell our product for, the buyer does. We are also expected to pay the trucking. It's just how it is. So this time of year we are paying our full time labor, trying to save money to pay for all of our incoming workers, making new investments for next year including staggering chemical and fertilizer bills, and we have no real income. Sorry this seems like one big run on sentence. Was this info helpful at all?",6.9260683e-13,1.0598607e-27,4.9699554e-11,8.0505704e-15,5.6336307e-11,9.421806e-15
Ruefuss,I appreciate the comment. It discusses the complexity of the farming industry beyond workers who are not here legally and are paid under the table.

bopp0,"Thank you so much for your kindness and civility. I think my family's farm exists somewhere between the enormous operations in the midwest and Cali, and the tiny hippie hobby farms that seem to be popping up.

Mjkittens,"Very helpful! Thank you for taking the time. I was off reading the article you linked, googling Adverse Affect Wage Rate and digging into the FSMA website. Thanks for the productive afternoon :DWhat struck me about the article was how familiar all of it was! I work for a large corporation and we deal with creating efficient compliance processes that address truly important issues like safety and anti-corruption - but when implemented incorrectly can cripple normal operations and just cause people to go around all the rules even more (I guess i work for the equivalent of Whole Foods in that article). It's just that I never connected any of these laws and policies (aka regulations) with anything *political* - they were just laws we had to ensure the company followed to not avoid getting sued, bad press, etc. I hope that simplifying rules and creating common sense regulations *should* be something that is non-political. Food safety is a good thing, but having thousands of rules that are hard to understand don't help that goal at all. I don't think abolishing the agencies and repealing all laws is the answer - but neither is piling more laws on old ones without stopping to ask what's achievable. And I'm sure the politicization of these issues fuels the oscillation between these two nonsensical extremes. Regarding adverse affect wage rate- Am I understanding that correctly as a tax meant to protect US workers from foreign workers “taking their jobs” at a lower wage- but in actuality you just end up having to pay foreign workers more as there's not a supply of domestic workers to take those kind of jobs? I guess this strikes me as the type of regulation Republicans would push rather than Democrats? That's another example of why I asked my original question, but I do wish someday we could address these issues without the politics. We all want lower unemployment, efficient costs that drive small business productivity, and safe, non-exploitive work environments. That shouldn't even be a dem vs. repub thing.This was so long, I forget what post I am in! But thanks again for the education. Really appreciate the sharing.Ps any links to help undress why dairy/grain is subsidized and apples are not?",1.3992003e-12,6.5489984e-27,3.8254933e-09,5.2463455e-15,8.174387e-11,3.7410772e-16
bopp0,"No worries! What a great response. I'm always happy to hear how we can relate to one another. It can be head bangingly frustrating, and as someone just working their way into it-terrifying. Not only do the decisions I make affect me, but so many other good people. It's a lot of pressure. The experience I seem to understand is that when Dems are in power, regs increase and attention paid to farms seems to decrease a bit, things get messy. I really don't think any farmer is happy with anyone in government ever, though. I'm certainly not. I don't know a ton about the origin of AAWR but that is correct. We always have to have one bed open in case any local person wants to work we MUST give them a job over a foreign worker and it is very expensive for an industry with no harvesting mechanization.You're so right, so many of these issues require such simple fixes. Literally just someone in government talking to a farmer, but it is so difficult. Anyway, I adore this response! Thank you so much for taking an interest in this issue it truly means the world to me. And I don't have a link but I do believe those crops continue to be subsidized because they are considered “staples”, there's a whole history to the government subsidizing agriculture...

pangzineng,"literally Wikipedia> In 1963, when Xi was age 10, his father was purged from the Party and sent to work in a factory in Luoyang, Henan.[22] In May 1966, Xi's secondary education was cut short by the Cultural Revolution, when all secondary classes were halted for students to criticise and fight their teachers. The Xi family home was ransacked by student militants and one of Xi's sisters, Xi Heping, was killed.[23] Later, his own mother was forced to publicly denounce him as Xi was paraded before a crowd as an enemy of the revolution. Xi was aged 15 when his father was imprisoned in 1968 during the Cultural Revolution; Xi would not see his father again until 1972. Without the protection of his father, Xi was sent to work in Liangjiahe Village, Wen'anyi Town, Yanchuan County, Yan'an, Shaanxi, in 1969 in Mao Zedong's Down to the Countryside Movement.[24] After a few months, unable to stand rural life, he ran away to Beijing. He was arrested during a crackdown on deserters from the countryside and sent to a work camp to dig ditches.[25] He later became the Party branch secretary of the production team, leaving that post in 1975. When asked about this experience later by Chinese state television, Xi recalled, ""It was emotional. It was a mood. And when the ideals of the Cultural Revolution could not be realised, it proved an illusion.""[26]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping#Early_life_and_education",2.831144e-13,1.6159905e-26,1.7867048e-09,1.2509654e-14,5.30127e-10,2.633996e-15

Soy isn't only consumed through traditional foods like soy sauce and tofu, but it's also consumed largely through packaged products. Most packaged products I've come across contain it.Almost anything in the ingredients on a food product that is labeled as ""vegetable, plant or bean"" is made from soy. There are other labels too which might not be immediately identified.Some of the most common examples of this are:* Vegetable Oil (accounts for almost all of the frying oil in the US* Protein* Lecithin* Emulsifier (in almost all chocolate)With all of that said, soy is still produced in extreme excess compared to what we need in the US alone.

brightpulse,"I know how trade works and I disagree with you. Trade is not just the raw materials in question here. Aside from the fact that other countries can export to the US at a cheaper tariff than US is charged, there are also technology exports in question. Countries like China put restrictions that the technology needs to to be shared with them to do business there. For example MS has to submit to the regulations, which are ridiculous and dictatorial, to China to do business there. US doesn't have similar restrictions on tech imported from China. Take for example the Android phones loaded with spyware selling in the US. This is one example and we can find many more and at a larger scale. If I am not correct, feel free to explain.

There were on average 2 suicide bombings per day in large civilian areas that killed dozens of people and that was just in Fallujah where I was. Those numbers are a part of Iraqbodycount. In fact they count every death remotely associated and blame American troops. It's easy to vilify our country and I don't know if you are from here or not but stop helping other governments divide us. Stop looking at things through socialist colored glasses.

That's not the issue I was protesting against. Also, was the rate of suicide bombings targeting Fallujah citizens more or less than when occupying US forces arrived?

Turns out compromise is a necessary step if you want two polarized parties to come together and actually get anything done. The left says ""save the environment!"" the right says ""we need more safety!"" so you design your legislation to have enough left-leaning things and enough right-leaning things in order to get it to pass. Now, because this is how the legislative branch works, the house and the senate start tacking on earmarks, adding in favors for certain members who are less likely to vote yes, etc, and you end up with most bills that manage to pass having lots and lots of things in them which the original did not. Now imagine that it's time to pass the yearly budget bill through. Time to decide which departments get more/less money from the federal government. But unfortunately, one side has a majority in either the house or senate, and says it refuses to pass the budget unless certain demands are met; demands asking for either significant, and even detrimental, pushes either further left or further right. So you try to talk to them, try to reason with them, and then the time limit for the passing of the budget runs out, and you have to temporarily shut down the government; you can't pay anyone. Eventually, you just have to say 'fine, we give in', because as a centrist it's more important that the government is operating at all. Remember all those earmarks? Remember the [demands of the single party threatening to stall the budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_government_shutdown_of_2013)?

I get what the other guy was saying and I absolutely *also* get what you're saying. You are both right. The whole world is fucked, it's just that a lot of Americans are finally “awake” enough to see that we are just as bad as some other parts of the world and that trite saying “freedom isn't free” is actually true (side note: duh.) Not saying this is the case for the guy above, but some people need some time to adjust to what (to them) is a brand new perspective of their homeland.

The jobs they hold might otherwise be held by citizens or legal immigrants. The public service they use impose burdens on our taxpayers.

In the budget I will present to you, we will try to do more to speed the deportation of illegal aliens who are arrested for crimes, to better identify illegal aliens in the workplace as recommended by the commission headed by former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan.

So...The problem is that Trump takes these complicated issues and hammers at it like a 3rd grader that was just made president. It tends to result in a situation where, at best, he's right and unnecessarily destructive. So there is a binary situation, either: a) China and the US have fair or US favoring trade. In this case we'd obviously want to leave it alone.b) China has a favorable trade relationship with the US that we should improve.If (a), this whole thing is an unmitigated disaster. The problem that is, even granting (b) (which I probably think was generally correct), unilaterally and suddenly applying tariffs is unnecessarily damaging to market certainty and diplomacy.

Mikeisright,"The problem is you are assuming that trade is fair in both your proposed situations (you said it's binary) - it isn't.Aside from the imposed tariffs being much lower for exports, the licensing fees, customs penalties, and regulations make it extremely difficult to manufacture and ship an equivalent product as opposed to just importing it. This is why even focusing in tariffs alone won't give you an accurate picture of trade. Here is an example:Company X produces an oil viscosity measurement tool in the U.S. and a Chinese company wants to use it. It already costs more to produce here, but now you are faced with shipping it to China. This specific device requires a license - that license costs $2,000 in the US, but China charges $30,000 and requires a full application process complete with pre-clearance, photos, detailed pictures and part numbers, etc. So let's say the company bites the bullet and applies for it but it takes 2 months for approval - that is additional 2 months of overhead, labor cost, additional steps (opening crates, repacking, etc). Then let's say it gets there, but it comes apart on the plane or carrier - very common. If you got 3 of 4 pieces there and it gets cleared, that last piece then needs to be sent back to the US, reapply for license, and hope it clears when you send it back.It's absolutely ridiculous the amount of hoops that foreign governments want the US to jump through.

Guess those bastions of free thought, democracy, civil rights and fair play that said loud and fucking clear ""Not with us"" went unnoticed (Pun intended). The problem is, when you delegitimize this form of protest, and you go, huh, I delegitimize all this protest, how wonderfull how unopposed I am, you tend to get fast reminders in the form of people doing mean snickers when you get faced with a person you can not delegitimize, because it actually hurts. Progress is never masured by your position on the ladder.

Take the russia europe relationship. Most europeans don't think that badly of russia. If you disregard the american media, the european view on russia is basically america, but with vodka and ushankas. And what do europeans do? They work gently, carefully, and use the old idea of, if we don't have any contact with our neighbor at all, we can't be neighborly. We know, the trade is important for russia, so we keep a trickle up. And let's face it, Russia does not produce a lot we need, so it's difficult to find the small things you could import, but it has wonderfull culture. But wonder over wonder, suddenly, we have a trade of culture, and of very small things, and we have reasons to send tradesmen back and forth. and they carry tiny bits of our culture with them. And suddenly, we go, yea, we can buy your gas, that's not hard to explain, even our Daddys bought your gas, but what will be hard to explain is how much semichki we want to import. You ask yourself, what is the problem? Well, if you look at the newspapers, death, destruction, badness, ect, if we now bring back the sunflower seeds, they will immediatelly think we applaud your behavior. Now, are they at least Bio? What I mean? Well, let's face it, you are a tradesman, I am one too, the bio seal in russia is completely new and nonexistant. If I now claim, hey, I saw these sacks of semichki in russia, and I noticed they were bio, and I bought about 3 tons, I can get rid of this easily. Yes, just for the seal! They like the idea this much. And we both know that both you and me don't have the pull to get much of anything done, but at the least, I want to bring semichki to my people! And bit by bit, we corrupt the people, and change their environment. And suddenly, they are in a village that is similar to european villages, that has a partner city status with european villages, that has european machines, because of the partnership, and even an european architect, and most of the people are amazied by the fields of biologically ok sunflowers that are growing around the village, the village is busy making semichki for export only, and there are so many meetings about an european seal of bio, and forming a half russian half european comission of semichki quality controll that the local hotel gets a stream of westerners, so the caffees get more traffic, the people get more westerners, and pretty fucking soon, this town is thoroughly westernised, just by the power of trade.",0.0076339943,8.5766436e-14,0.043805365,1.2266658e-08,1.2457925e-06,2.6811716e-11
Meistermalkav,"And if you have this thoroughly westernised town, you can pull this up in scale, and westernise the region.

Then, it is only a question of time before we build so much goodwill amongst the people, just by our semichki loving antics, that maybe we will not get the big prize, but in a generation, the guys that grow up now will have spent their summers in european style friendship camps and speak german / english, because their fathers sold semichki to europe, and all in all, fuck me, it's amazing over there, how come we don't have this shit over at us, I mean, this is not that different? And boom, just to exposure to a powerfull culture, we infect the other culture. if the culture is powerfull enough, they think german music, they either think techno, or they think rammstein / nena, because they have become impregnated by our culture. And don't tell me any other european nation is worse in it, because wherever I look, I see nations that could outdo germany easily in hospitality. And with time and time, the local kids will have european standarts, not because they went to school in europe, but because of the trade. They will tell us what we should trade next, what's actually good in the region. They want their own countries to be left alone, but admit it, everyone likes a bit of cultural warfare. Because if cultural warfare means you eat my sausage, I eat yours, we compare which tastes better, this is warfare everyone can agree to. And then the americans come, and say, we embargo russia, and suddenly, all that blyatifull progress is destroyed, because whenever they have a socially retarded president, they become socially retarded as a country and antagonize the whole world in a bid to show them they are still relevant. And the russians of course have to repocitrate, and we stand here, dicks out, chewing on the last semichki, because our friends from those tiny russian villages get ripped away from us, and we were not allowed to drink brotherhood, and we feel violated. Fuck it, we can do the same with China. We can go to local chinese villages, and we can buy rice. OF course, that means we have to send a delegation over, we find the local most rustic villages in germany, and we go, okay, this is a village in the shadow of the alps, let's pack the alp horns, dress the entire delegation up in dirndl and lederhosen, and transport a bavarian herd of cows with two steers to the village. And they will be mortified when the bavarians arrive, or having a laughing fit (Lert's be homnest, the chances are 50 / 50), and start bringing all this strong culture, and the herd of cows will be thanked for, but they don't fucking know what to do with the new cows... and they want to partner up? They mean it? They could have had Tsingdao or any other city, but they want the partner village of us, the smallest of the villages in fucking nowhere? Fuck yea! And before long, there is a local german culture club, several of the local ladies wear imported german dirndl, the local cows graze peacefully, because they are rustic as shit and need to be hit by a 2 ton truck before they move, and the local youths repurpose the alphorns we left over there as giant bongs because with all the jodeling we forgot to tell them what they are for. And we let it fester and stew, and then we charter lufthansa flights for them, to visit us. OH you holy shit, there will be a full on culture program, with yodeling, and gamsbart, and western values, and freedom, and drinking as much beer as you can till you vomit, and then drink some more. and we will discuss that rice is really really multi purpose, and we as a village would like to have all the bio rice they can sell, could you please help us. You know the rice, you know bio, let's figure something out. Oh, and coincidentially, you have problems with electricity? We have had, too, untill we went renewable, it-..... what do you mean, you can build that cheaper? Son, let's have an other beer, and you tell me all about that. And because we don't label this a diplomatic mission, and because it's not all about western values and shit, it's about the rice, you see, and the semichki, and so forth, suddenly, we get green light, because exporting semichki to europe, fuck, that sounds like plan that debil cooked up, but lets see if it works, and the same with rice to the alps. We use the trade as a channel though wich we establish diplomatic missions. What otherwise would get road blocked because ""we don't want german / european values over here"" passes because, suddenly, it's not about the values, it's about the product you see, and we travell over here too, so we give as much back as we take. So we spread the value.... what do you mean this is exactly how cosmopolitanism works? Fuck those guys are good at that! Democracy? Fuck me, we don't teach that, this would be diplomacy and statesmanship, and we germans are horrible at that. Instead, we teach them about electing the local beer and wine queen, it's all in good fun, right, pretty girl from the reigion who represents the local interests of the beer and wine farmers, PR figure head, who could say anything against that? It's not democracy, it's publicity, but see, you guys make a pretty damn tasty wine, this wine must have a wine queen. Civil rights? What is that? This is a trade and culture mission, right? Oh, we make sure we get our delegation before fasching, so they can see how the local mayor has to leave his office for 7 days, because the crazy women now rule, for those 7 days. Oh, it's not really ruling, you see, it's tradition, they mostly drink wine and eat candy, why don't you go and mingle with our kader of drunken feminist trade unionists, oops, did I say this out loud, well, two can play this game, and the last time you let me talk to a farmer it turned out the farmer understood english but the translator was the son of the local party chief, so, two can play that game. Fair play? Please, this is cultural and tradition and trade exchange, can't you see? I mean, who would have anything against us teaching you guys about soccer? I mean, soccer is basically germany. Now, you have a tradition to eat sausages in a bun, drink local beer and wine, wear locally knitted items on your hat, the crazier the better, watch 11 people play against each other, not based on affiliation but based on merit, and all over, we can sit here, together, despite being from different regimes and from opposite sides of the earth, and cheer for our teams, because this is not diplomacy, this is culture and trade.... Motherfucker, this international friendship, again? Fuck, you guys are good at this. Can we have some more bratwurst please, it goes well with plum wine, don't you think, and nobody had anything against electing the prettiest local plum farmers daughter as the plum wine queen. Fucking stroke of genius, that is, contests of beauty are highly sought off. Not one party official said anything after we explained to him that we basically needed a figurehead for the local plum wine sales, and we elected it based on beauty. We have done this time and time again. Every village over 500 people has a partner city, the more opressed and foreign the place the better. Several have partner cities even in america. Where I grew up, two villages over, this village was the envy of the area, because they managed to snag up an honest to god zulu village in the middle of nowhere, and they had a god damn cultural exchange like a motherfucker. Within 3-4 years, several of the local girls managed to ululate, while they had the entire crew from there walk around in sandals and white socks by day 4. This is trade diplomancy. You don't trade with the people because you allready like them, you trade with the people because you don't trust them. Because you never want it to come to the ""it's us versus them"" phase, you want it to stay at ""It's your president versus my president, we can't do shit against this, but when this is over, you promise we will have a soccer rematch, I could really go for some german wine with chinese dumplings.

There's a reason there's been so much backlash against these tariffs from both parties equally. It is simply a stupid move. This will only hurt the economy, not help it.

Cautemoc,"Well, by definition 10 years ago is also years ago. Being more specific in one thread doesn't indicate a lack of information by being more general elsewhere. That baseless accusation aside, I can absolutely give you some facts.10 years ago was based on the article [here](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/what-you-may-not-know-about-china-and-currency-manipulation/).>The solid line in the chart above shows that the yuan has strengthened 35% against the U.S. dollar over the *past decade*. All else equal, this represents an effective rise in the price of Chinese exports to the United States by more than one-third, which is certainly not consistent with the charge of continued intentional underpricing.>Also, the price of Chinese exports depends on the yuan price of what it costs to manufacture in China, not just the yuan price of foreign currencies, and inflation in China has been higher than that of its trading partners. The multilateral, inflation-adjusted price of Chinese exports (represented by the dashed line in the chart) accounts for both of these factors. The chart shows that the overall real relative price of worldwide Chinese exports has risen more than 50% in the *past decade*, with almost 40% of this increase in the past two years. This has occurred because of the yuan's appreciation against the dollar, the yuan's appreciation against the currencies of its other trading partners (as the dollar has appreciated), and the higher rate of inflation in China than among its trading partners.So, the reference was based on multiple data points referencing the last decade. However, accounting for 40% of the inflation being the last 2 years (from 2015, so another 3 years have passed), even under the most extreme interpretation they stopped at least years ago.Edit: Here's another source for you that specifically references 10 years ago.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/business/economy/trump-china-currency-manipulation-trade.html",2.077446e-13,7.0407726e-29,8.657223e-11,2.5788148e-16,3.558497e-12,6.940018e-17

EatzGrass,"It's going to be painful, but we are going to win and be fine.There are only 2 ways to create money from nothing. Either take it out of the earth and sell it or use materials and manufacture it. Every other job; Lawyer, banker, stockbroker, policeman, doctor, lawmaker, teacher etc. just pushes money around. No new money comes into the system and these professions take their cut out of the pool. Oh, I guess we could print money, but that has a whole new set of negative consequences.Our current system since the early 90's has allowed most of our manufacturing happen in poor countries like China for a nice short term profit bang into retailers and manufacturing company owners. This has created giant monopolistic corporate behemoths that trade globally but provide zero or net loss to the U.S. economy as a whole besides their stock prices which I'll get to in a minute. The effect has been extremely negative as the population as a whole has to fight over the scraps left from operating in an almost pure service economy.The pain is going to come from adding the costs of paying our manufacturers to make our goods now. These manufacturers are saddled with the extreme overhead of operating in a service economy but that doesn't make their existence less necessary. The status quo of giant corporations will burn and stock prices will fall hard once the common worker is able to eek out a small profit making stuff to sell. Personally, I feel that's where Trump is going to lose his balls once he realizes stock market loss must be accounted for. He knows that stock prices gauge success in a president and won't be able to handle most Americans taking a hit on their 401k's.Anyway, if we do get through this correction, these new manufacturers will infuse their economies with jobs and money. All local services mentioned before will benefit from this. A rising tide lifts all boats. Don't listen to anyone that says you can make anything on a 3d printer and robots by the way. That's fucking stupid. I've been in manufacturing my whole life and ALL manufacturing requires manual labor.Edit; I forgot to answer you actual question.

Brand_Awareness,"Top level manager at global manufacturer here -- let me start off by saying you can certainly get away with automation; not for everything as of today, but as AI develops so machines can have more fluid operational parameters than present what little value human labor brigs to the table will be eroded. I think what your maybe distracted by is the fact that manufacturing is still a relative infant industry in the U.S. due to it's development being stunted in the 90's by the outsourcing wave -- lots of Ma and Pa ""build to print"" organizations still exist and run more-or-less like they did in the 80's; they didn't need to adapt to new market conditions (apart from there being much less work) because those market conditions were only concerned with the majority of manufacturing activities which were taking place elsewhere in the world. They don't understand how things have changed because they figured they were doing well to be open so never bothered educating themselves while their customers couldn't be bothered to spend the time -- they think that when the work comes back state side they'll be in line, what they don't realize is a large portion of it already has without all this trade war B.S.; they just weren't in the loop because they can't really handle the needs of their customers anymore nor are they prepared to make the changes necessary as quickly as they would need to do so.I'll also point out that your premise about wealth generation is incorrect. While it's true that service is low-value compared to physical product at the entity level (for individuals service is -- the people on the line actually producing the stuff are the least valuable; plenty of people can screw one thing to another, much fewer can do the Cpk gage R&R analysis in conformance to ISO17025 required for capacity/capability validation) it certainly doesn't mean that service products generate no value -- services exist to meet market demands which set valuation; the fact that someone is paid to render service means that service has the value of that payment. For instance you say bankers don't produce value/money, but they arrange the finances necessary for organizations to maintain operational budgets month-to-month, if bankers didn't exist than organizations -- including those that extract things or make things -- could not function as they would not have the monetary resources necessary to do so. Thus to say they do not make money/have value is simply incorrect; they make money/have value because they produce a service that is every bit as necessary to our way of life as people making car engines... could even likely say more so.Now, whether we can shelter this trade war and emerge a stronger economy is debatable -- it is true that these trade deals has made exporting jobs and importing the profits much easier which has certainly hurt the U.S. economy more than it has hurt the economies where those jobs were shipped to. However to simply assume that there is an internal demand large enough to support itself to the extent necessary to maintain standard of living for all citizens is not accurate either. Certainly the idea that the U.S. will return to its glory days of the post-war to globalization era is absolutely ludicrous -- we had so much wealth then because we were the world's exporter, so shutting ourselves off to global trade is guaranteed to prevent us from achieving those levels of success.",1.3919939e-13,1.3268395e-28,2.4885066e-10,2.688539e-16,2.2264597e-12,1.5714738e-17
EatzGrass,"Well we are at a tipping point as far as finding stuff for people to do. Maybe that line worker provides limited value for the corporation, but it sure as hell provides value for his community. Corporations, by their very nature, cannot be trusted to do the right thing and we are at a point where we either pay people outright for doing nothing or pay them to do menial tasks again. Things really are that dire and the shortsightedness of industrializing poor countries for the sake of short term profits might mean saving manufacturing is now impossible. Either way, we either throw our hands in the air and give up, or try to fix things. I stated in a reply that services do not create money because of taxes. An exchange of money is not a zero sum game since the government has it's hands out on the transaction. I'm sure you have seen the results on a macro scale of the effects of giving our manufacturing away to people who have a ""as long as I get mine"", and a ""race to the bottom"" attitude. These are basic tenets of untethered capitalism and it really does not work for the benefit of the general population which we are painfully finding out now. The corporations drive for increased PROFITS is the very base of problems with the system. It forces a corporation to stomp on their neighbor and consume them for shareholder confidence. You aren't going to invest in a company with a flatline 6 percent profit margin with no opportunity for growth and it would be dumb to do that as an owner since profitability attracts competition and your competitive lifespan would be limited.

sprucenoose,"There are many, many avenues to deal with that problem in a more hardline manner:1. Go through the WTO. We did that many times previously, and won in many cases with China. Winning a case with the WTO generally means that every other country in the WTO applies a duty on certain exports from the losing country as punishment, and the winning country can apply such a duty to offset its losses. FYI, this is exactly what China is going to do to the US as a result of the US's unilaterally tariffs, meaning the US will be hammered by every other country if China wins.2. Enter into a trade agreement that protects US IP and provides economic leverage against China. We almost had that. It is called the Trans Pacific Partnership, or TPP. Trump torpedoed it, having China a HUGE win and weakening our negotiating position.3. Take other economic actions against China that are not so obvious and inflammatory. For example, devalue the US currency a bit. China hates that. They flipped their shit with the US's recent quantitative easing, which had nothing to do with China directly, which is why China couldn't do anything about it.4. Engage in a diplomatic solution. China wants lots of non-economic things from the US, e.g., less interference with the South China sea, less interference with Taiwan, easier relationships with North Korea, etc. negotiate a deal.5. Sink to China's level. China is now developing lots of new, innovative items that it has an interest in protecting. Refuse to enforce China's IP unless they enforce the US's. Appropriate their IP at times as well.These are just a few examples, there are innumerable tools in the toolkit here.

usuallyusemyname,"I totally get that and your explanation is great. However, with a biz like Amazon, for example, a foreign seller (china for example) ships their products directly to Amazon and when the foreign seller sells the product, Amazon ships it for them. We use to hate WalMart because everything was made in China, right? Well, at-least then it was a US company marking up the product that was manufactured for dirt cheap in China. So most of the money stayed here. Because the foreign sellers are now the ones marking it up, only 15% (Amazons fee) is staying in the US. That can't be good. And as a small US biz owner, I can confidently say that every time I launch a new product that gets merely 5-10+ sales a day, it takes 3 months tops for the foreign knock-offs (mostly from China) to flood the market. Once that happens, it's a race to the bottom on price until I can no longer compete and move on to something else. Even when I have trademarks (which by the way, takes up to 8 months so Ive been knocked off well before that happens) it's a full time job reporting these sellers as so many pop up and they just sell it on another username once I get them pulled by Amazon. On top of that, there's no repercussions for them as they're in another country - a small biz can not even legally go after them. They also cheat the system with fake reviews and buying your items and sending them to fake addresses just so they can give you a poor review and also get a refund by Amazon. It's nuts. And any Amazon retailer can attest to everything I just said - it's well known. I am a TINY biz and every retailer in the US now deals with this. More and more ppl buy everything on Amazon and I'm pretty sure that between them and China, our country is in serious trouble if we don't do something. And they're violating tech IP now so our one advantage of Silicon Valley doesn't seem so solid anymore. I'm not an economist and am speaking purely as a biz owner but I think tariffs are the only option. I know our president is an idiot and I mostly can't stand him like everyone else but I would have wanted Bernie to do the same (and way more). Maybe it's misguided but our trade deficit currently feels like a transfer of wealth from the US to China.

Indeed, everything is physical (in some form) and plenty of things go against each other. The way we produce things and do work shapes our culture. That's simple enough.That doesn't justify full communism or socialism, particularly because of its impracticality. If I could choose a communist utopia right now, sign me the fuck up. An entirely communist/socialist nation is very likely to fail though, as they're often coupled with tyrannical dictatorships who do have class division while pretending they do not and hold certain people as more important, making the inequality actually even more glaring than in capitalism/democracy.Democracies have proven to work, and capitalism, with all its flaws when unbridled in assuring a fair chance and good life to everyone, it's been successful as of late. To improve the situation of the ""proletariat,"" select socialist policies or institutions can be put in place. These are things already in a capitalist U.S. like taxpayer funded highways, bridges, other infrastructure, and schools, and welfare programs. A step up would be single payer universal healthcare, and as automation steps up, universal basic income.

The dialectical materialism thing was something that one guy whose comment was removed mentioned and I was discussing that with him, as well as the fact that he said ""socialism is the inevitable future, so we should give up"" or something, a statement with which I disagree. Admittedly, on dialectical materialism, I only read a few websites that appeared after googling that so I didn't even pretend to be well-versed on it; I simply saw that it was the opposite of idealism, doesn't allow for non-physical existence like colonialism being because God wanted it that way as opposed to the underlying cause of conflict with resources and human innate desire to acquire more land.

Then at 9:30, the real numbers for today come in when trading starts. A good place to go is yahoo finance. They have the futures (mini Dow) up now and switch over at 9:30 to the DJI. The thing is that futures generally trade pretty close to the previous day's close, which was 24033 yesterday. So it is rare to see them down 544 pts (2.3%) at the moment. Also, the value of the futures rarely matches what happens in a trading day, so it is likely the opening will be much lower than the 544 points and may drop or rise from there.

Goodbot9000,"If you predict economic doom every month until it happens (which it inevitably will, since the economy is cyclical) were you actually right all along? No. Timing matters. If inflation is increasing, metals will increase in price, because they are a hedge against inflation. It's not predictive of anything, it's reactionary. Here's a forecast: The Fed has announced that it will raise rates either 4 times, or 5 times, this year. This is to combat inflation from QE and 0% interest rates during Obama's entire presidency. We are already in an inflationary period, and the fed knows it. Combine this with the fact that we issued tons of T-Bills for our government spending (during an already inflationary period). We really needed to chill on our spending, not make it worse, if we wanted to smoothly come out of this economic expansionary period. Because of this, the fed will likely need to raise interest rates either higher, or more often, than predicted this year, leading to falling incomes, and more failure to repay debt.They key insight here is that we aren't entering a expansionary economic cycle, we are exiting one, which means the central bank will enact deflationary measures, rather than inflationary ones. What this means in practice is that, if employment and GDP drop, inflation will as well as a result of implemented policy. Which means that, even when we enter a recession (which we will) stagflation will not occur. QE **really** fucked up the economic cycle in an unnatural way. instead of smoothing a deleveraging that needed to occur, it prevented it all together. While this means that the next crash will likely be worse than anything that came before it, it is not a reason to forecast stagflation.TL:DR - the logic doesn't make sense looking at forward values, current values, or past values. This is because he doesn't understand what stagflation is, or what circumstances allow it to occur.",2.627239e-10,7.94333e-26,1.904385e-08,2.340122e-14,1.2603851e-10,1.015523e-15

Nuranon,"Which says relatively little without comparison. Yes I underestimated the US exports to Asia but having said that:[This](http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/?country=undefined&partner=undefined&product=1763&productClass=HS&startYear=undefined&target=Product&year=2014) gives you an overview of the biggest car exporter countries and yes, the US are in 3rd place but behind Germany and Japan which together only have around [half the GDP PPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)) of the US. And yes, the US still produce a lot of cars but when you take take their share of exports from above and [the graphs here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry#World_motor_vehicle_production) you can see that by relatively to their market share of cars produced their exports lack severely which means that US cars are relatively far less in demand internationally, given that they are in exports outmatched by Germany and Japan about 1:4(.3).[Here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Global_imports_and_exports_of_cars.png) another graph [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States) which paints a similiar picture (the US aren't exporting that many cars), sadly imports aren't distinguished in any way. And in the same article you can see how the share of imported cars in the US market [steadily grows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_the_United_States#/media/File:Imported_cars_as_a_percent_of_vehicles_sold_in_the_US.png) and is now at around 25% which still isn't that high but shows once more where US cars are going or rather not going - the US only export around 13% of their own car market (by value) in cars while importing somewhere around 25% (slowly growing).I mean the biggest story propably still is the explosive growth of cars produced in China. I have trouble finding good statistics here but [this](https://asia.nikkei.com/var/site_cache/storage/images/node_43/node_51/2015/201504/20150407/20150409-chinas-car-market-pie/2580272-1-eng-GB/20150409-Chinas-car-market-pie_article_main_image.png) is quite interesting. I'm not an expert but it seems like China going the reverse path of US when it comes to cars...the share of cars manufactured domestically by Chinese manufacturers is growing and presumebly they will eventually start exporting more, while the US see a (slowly) declining share of domestically produced cars and are increasingly less dominant internationally.",8.18313e-13,4.6939828e-27,1.8991399e-08,2.4807708e-15,3.3637253e-11,1.159856e-16

If your historic average on corn is 150 bushels/acre and you pick 80% coverage your revenue guarantee is 120 bu/acre x price (one set in Feb, one set in the fall, your guarantee is the higher and if fall price is lower you use that to calculate a claim)Government nearly pays all at 50% coverage - because that level will almost never pay, but at that 80% you're gonna pay about 4x or so of the 50% level. Insurance isn't really a money maker for farmers, it's a security blanket. Plus if you need it every year it goes into a spiral of diminishing returns as a bad year lowers your average and then your guarantee.

BowlingShoeSalesman,"No. The only subsidy right now is for crop insurance. It's based on your average production history and spring and fall price for grain. If we have a crop failure it will kick in, but if we have average or good production the price alone probably wont trigger a payment. The insurance is still an out of pocket expense. The government does pay a portion of it.I'm in Iowa, corn and soy farmers, as a state we don't take in more insurance claim payments than what our premiums are. If you look at southern states, on average they take in more on claims than their premiums cost.

TomBradysmom,"To be fair, there is some merit in terms of correcting a trade deficit....the bigger a trade deficit, the bigger risk you have so you're exporting more of your currency (more dollars out for more imports in). The more currency that's held outside of your country can hurt you. If China decided to sell all of our currency they hold, it would make the value of our dollars lower, which in turn causes inflation to rise and only widens the trade deficit. That being said....trade wars are still not usually successful and end up being a losing proposition. The biggest risk to China is them losing ground of selling to one of the largest economies in the world.",2.5929332e-14,3.680198e-31,3.4739366e-12,1.3717368e-16,6.372569e-12,9.403304e-17

During the 80's they tried to turn it into Vegas II but it never really caught on at that level. Most of the casinos (both his and others) had lackluster performance. Then he built the Taj, which was the most expensive casino in the city. It did better, but given how it was financed required several debt restructurings (his bankruptcies) before it was financially viable. At that point the writing was on the wall. Connecticut opened a casino, and Pennsylvania followed suit. Now if you are coming from NY, DC or Philadelphia, you have to pass multiple casinos to get to AC. He actually did do quite a bit to try and boost AC, for example getting Tyson to fight there on several occasions. But alas, it just wasn't to be. As for how it was ""just"" his casinos, the vast majority of his casino operations were in that one basket. Now that a bunch of the casinos have closed the market is smaller, which should help those remaining. Anyhow, the main point is, a casino in AC isn't the money printing operation it might seem like. He did have a good run in the mid-90 (after a restructuring or two) but was hit pretty hard by the downturn and eventually sold off his involvement in those business units.

And I honestly don't think CNN is biased against the GOP/President, I think they are biased toward the tabloidy end to attrack readers (so is Fox to an extent, can't go there without one of their top stories being celebrity gossip or small town shock story) But Fox News is the only place where you will see them blatantly not cover objectively major news stories if they are bad for the president. The kind of stories that are on the front page of every network, every print news, down to the local papers that run national stories. I remember the day after McCain's thumbsdown killing health-care repeal it was everywhere, but wholly absent from Fox News. If there is a bad story for the President, Fox News consistently exercises one of the following options:1. Don't cover it, true blackout on the story2. Cover it, but bury it deep in the page3. Cover somebody else talking about it (I.e, Instead of writing the headline ""X Happened"" write ""PERSON Says: X is a made up conspiracy""4. Actually cover it - but this only happens until they can find a suitable quote to go with option 3Sorry for the rant, Fox News is just so blatantly propaganda it blows my mind that anyone defends them.

From his public statements Trump seems to believe that Trade balances (i.e. the US populace buys $100B worth of Chinese stuff and the Chinese populace only buys $50B of US stuff) actually mean something significant, as if a trade deal negotiation actually means the leaders sit down and figure out ""we'll buy 50 horses from you and take 10 iron in exchange"" like you're playing civilization. Trump sees that $50B a year trade balance and because of this incorrect starting point comes to the conclusion ""we're getting ripped off!"" without any further understanding of international trade or how the chinese actually DO cheat on trade deals. Because of this incorrect understanding, he seems to believe that if we have a $50B trade deficit, and we kill all trade with china, we're up $50 Billion and we're ""winning"" even if nothing else happens. In fact, everyone who supplied that $100B in goods from china has to look for other suppliers (only a fraction of which can come from US in short term) and pass prices onto their consumers, and everyone who sold that $50B in goods to China gets killed by retaliation.",3.8078127e-08,6.968787e-14,1.2531159e-06,8.1720503e-07,1.5844573e-05,4.56324e-07

I was a US Infantryman and I would never say I was poorly trained and a lot of what I have seen and read supports that. You are missing other points as well. Sure China could convert factories to war production but currently their gear is not as good as their US Counterparts nor do I think they would be able to make that technological jump. Then we have the elephant in the room. China relies on their Oil imports. The US could shut down the Persian Gulf and limit other oil imports. The US can also project power better and probably disrupt internal production as well. The US also has allies and more importantly it has allies in the area. I am not sure if Canada or Mexico would go to bat for China....

The domestic producers of those metals won't keep their prior prices out of the goodness of their hearts, they'll raise prices to at least match the cost of the imports. If anything, they'll also make the imports less common, which creates an additional cost when trying to purchase those materials because that industry operates entirely on bulk and there's a substantial time and manpower cost when arranging the import of materials from a new supplier (not just the process of finding the supplier and making the deal, but also checking and QC'ing the materials as they come in to ensure everything was communicated correctly and the companies are cooperating well) - so by kicking foreign suppliers out of the market, the domestic companies make it much harder for them to come back in.Let me put it this way; if you have a car factory and you stamp metal sheets into door panels, you probably built your machines to do this with sheet steel that is 1/8th inch thick. If you get sheets that are 1/8th inch plus a bit, it breaks your machines; if you get sheets that are 1/8th minus a bit, it breaks your machines. If the alloy is different, it breaks your machines. If you check the thickness (fairly easy, but requires a lot of man-hours) and the alloy composition (a chemical process that is more difficult and much slower) before putting it through your machines, then you avoid breaking the machines. But then you have to send all that metal back, and now you don't have anything to run through your machines at all, so the factory shuts down until you can get new sheet metal. If one of those factories has to shut down for a week, it could go bankrupt from the loss of revenue, failure to deliver on contracts, and damage to its reputation. Some other company is waiting on the delivery of those door panels, and so your problem causes the same problem to their factory too.In industry, it can be hugely expensive and time-consuming to change suppliers, even for a material that is supposedly the same.",1.0562117e-09,3.22429e-20,7.893409e-07,9.793462e-12,1.3290667e-08,4.7060825e-13

Bickering about an election that happened a year ago is not helpful. This is not a democrat thing or a republican thing. This is about whether or not your Walmart tab is going to go up 25% in the next two years. How many small US manufacturers are going to shut down because they don't have the capital to make the jump from Chinese sourced material to US sourced materials. Or the companies that are going to lay people off because their international markets are going to be halved. What about those who find themselves suddenly over leveraged when revenue initially drops? Will they have the floating capital to deal with decreased sales while consumers get used to higher prices? Probably not. Yes, incomes may go up from this and there could be some good job growth in industries that haven't been targeted by China and the EU. Both would happen in five years, maybe. But inflation and the first round of lay offs would happen a lot sooner. Remember, they don't call it a trade war for nothing. In a conventional war, the only ones really at risk are American soldiers in some far off land. In a trade war, your enemy can very easily destroy the economy of your small town if they choose.

ZeJerman,"In the soy situation, other exporting countries could be winners, as the barrier of entry has been lowered due to the increased price of sale. Worked in Trade and Logistics in Aus and currently working in Germany, I havent seen a situation where businesses dont pass on the cost of a tariff, as it lifts the cost of the entire market. It will also take time to ramp up the economy of scale as current EU producers (Read EU as non-US producers) already have orders that need to be filled with their existing customers. This ultimately shifts the worldwide soybean market but, again it is often difficult to shift customers from one producer to another, as there is some amount of ris in doing so.Just because the US Soybean is cheaper, doesnt mean that they will be bought by importers immediately, there is often different Quarantine requirements on products from the US, as they have different plant based diseases to other regions, and if they dont have an established market in the country they want to sell to that barrier to entry may be prohibitevly high.It will be intersting to see what happens here.Almost everyone is a net loser, although some non US or China parties may win a little as they fill in the gap left by the tariffs.",1.0852683e-11,2.1179665e-25,1.9798079e-09,9.2127396e-14,3.6556672e-10,2.2699157e-14

ZeJerman,"Correct. It takes effort, investment and risk to change suppliers, especially overseas suppliers.If the tariffs are removed and the supply chains have been solidified with non-US suppliers, US suppliers would need to make it economically worth while to Chinese importers to change over back to them. This is also difficult because the US suppliers would have lost a significant section of thier economy of scale and the non-EU supplier gained the advantage of a larger economy of scale.Not to mention the other factors, such as less ship space US to China, because as the demand of US products drops so does the demand for ship space, making previously economicaly sound shipping lanes no longer economicaly viable.This isnt just onesided though, the same exact points can be made for China also, just that China has much more influence on the rest of the world markets than the US.This trade war can cause serious long term issues for both the US and China.",1.0588211e-14,4.877561e-28,3.6230008e-10,1.6509681e-15,8.235243e-12,1.9494229e-16

The United States retaliated by imposing tariffs on an array of goods, including French brandy, light trucks and Volkswagen buses. The United States even threatened to reduce its troop presence in Europe. Despite those pressures, the newly formed European Economic Community did not back down, and in that sense the United States “lost” the war.>The biggest losers, though, were American and European consumers deprived of choices in the marketplace and forced to pay higher prices for what was available.>There were also unintended consequences.

As prices begin to drop people begin panicking and start dumping investments to accrue as little of a loss as possible, and the cycle repeats.What you should do, IMO: is hold.

But what happens, in 10 years, when the student loan bubble pops, and many people are defaulting on their student loans, and can no longer afford to buy things?

NAN,1.5mil won't be enough to retire on in 30 years. It will be worth 3x less bc of inflation. You need at least 5 mil. And yes there will be a crash of some sort in the future but the point is that you have enough time to recover. If there is a crash in 10 years you have another 20 to recover from it before you are 65. So who cares. It takes a few short years to fully recover from a major crash it's only relevant for old people planning to retire in that time window. But for you it's pointless to be so conservative. It's low risk no doubt. But there is no need to be so low risk. If you were going to retire in 10 years I would say ok that makes sense.

I_inform_myself,"so, between my IRA and my 401K, i am set to have about 2 mil by 65 (less if I retire early).2 Mil by about 2057-58 will be worth the equivalent to about 785K now.Now, taken some good advice from my finance class, you want your investment to grow through retirement (since you don't have pull it all out when you retire).So it was said you want to have returns of 4% and only pull 3%.So, by the time I retire, 3% of 2 mil is $60,000 a year, or $23,500 now. So When I retire, I will basically have an income of $60K a year, plus social security (if it is still a thing). With my current contributions, and not getting a new job, or title change, and keeping a 2.5% raise each year.We were also told, not to have any outstanding debt when you retire. No mortgage, no car payments, no credit card debt. That way you can plan your retirement and still make money. But, I plan to get bigger raises, find a new job. Potentially go back to school and become a lawyer (practicing environmental law and workmen compensation). If I go that route, I highly doubt that I will need to really worry about my income, especially into retirement.But, even if I don't.

The tariff is designed to make American soy more expensive than growing the local industry. American tariffs won't work, America isn't 3 cents away from being the best place to produce these goods and they have no longevity. As soon as the tariffs lapse China goes back to being the best place to produce (assuming it wasn't when tariffs were in place). That isn't true the other way around. Once American made goods move overseas (pushed by Chinese tariffs) they are very unlikely to ever return.

Under Obama, there was the first positive job growth in manufacturing starting around the 2nd year till the end of his terms.

I do lean left on most issues but that doesn't mean I even like either party due to how both sides use wedge issues to drum up votes and are both heavily influenced by political donations instead of the citizens who they are supposed to represent.Here is one example of a Democrat who has had $456k in donations from oil and gas groups and heavily favors pro oil and gas policy and is ranked as the worst Democrat in environmental issues. Although pushing for oil/coal/gas will create jobs in that sector, I feel that almost half a million dollars is a pretty nice reason to vote in favor of it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi_Heitkamp#Energy_and_environmenthttp://www.ontheissues.org/International/Heidi_Heitkamp_Energy_+_Oil.htmhttps://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/summary?cid=N00033782&cycle=2018http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Heidi_Heitkamp_Environment.htmNo matter who you are, you shouldn't feel comfortable with any politicians whose campaigns are being paid for by corporations and billionaires because it is not your best interests they will be voting for. Personally I think that it would be better for everyone no matter what party if there was less lobbying and corporate donations to political leaders who are supposed to represent us. Right now, many news stations are owned by a single company who will give you highly biased news so it will be hard to see what is real and what is not. A good representation of this is the Sinclair Broadcast Group paying millions of dollers to own local stations who all use the same exact bias script to tell you that other stations give you ""false news"" and they will be reporting in your best interests due to them being the ""local station"". This is one of the most unnerving Black Mirror/George Orwell's 1984-esk videos of the propaganda machine I have seen when all over the country these news stations will be pushing whatever story they are told to say. Try to double check news/statistics from reliable sources because a lot of things you will hear will be ""alternative facts"".**I really hope you watch this 1m:39s video below**https://twitter.com/Deadspin/status/980175772206993409This isn't a team sport or an us vs them situation, citizens should stand united against things like this.

farmingdirt,"Thanks. I was fully aware of trump's hard stance on trade before the election and anyone with half a brain in agriculture was aware that we are a nation that needs to export grain. I didn't vote for him but I understood his appeal on many topics. Global grain production and imports and exports are TYPICALLY a zero sum game (hopefully). That is, China will take more soybeans from Brazil and Argentina (like they do every year already) and less from us. So this, in theory, will lead to higher prices in Brazil. That will lead other countries to buy from us instead of Brazil because of assumed price differences and so on and so forth. It doesn't always work that way and governments can get in the way of the free market sometimes.This was a vastly simplified version of things but I hope people get the point. China isn't going to starve their people and the rest of the world won't quit buying grain. Will these tariffs devastate US farmers? They might. They might also just cause short term disruption in the markets while the world shifts around where they get grain from.

GaydolphShitler,"TL;DL: Tariffs are generally a bad idea.Slightly longer version: placing a tariffs on imported widgets can offer protection to US widget producers by increasing the price to consumers of imported widgets. Unfortunately, if widgets are needed to manufacture doohickies, increasing the cost of widgets will fuck over the doohicky industry. If doohickies are a consumer product (extra points if they're something like gas or food that you can't really opt not to purchase), the added price will hurt consumers. If consumers have to spend more money on doohickies, they don't have as much money to spend on, say, widgets. Also, if doohickies are used in the supply chain for widgets, the widget tariff may end up *hurting* the widget industry by increasing their raw material costs. That's not even including the possibility of foreign counter-tariffs; if Country A increases tariffs to protect their domestic widget industry, the obvious choice for Country B is to simply apply their own tariffs on widgets exported from Country A. If the increase in local demand for widgets in A doesn't outpace the reduction in global widget demand (for example, if A exports more widgets to B than it imports), then the reduction in sales may end up screwing over the widget industry instead of helping it. Basically, the world economy is so interconnected nowadays that throwing tariffs around willy-nilly is a little like trying to hurt your neighbor by lighting their roof on fire.

GaydolphShitler,"They don't really go into it in that podcast, but tariffs can be useful in certain circumstances. You just need to be *really* careful about how you use them, because they tend to have weird, unexpected consequences.For example: Country A's economy depends largely on widget production. Most of the widgets made there are consumed domestically (only a small portion are exported), and most of raw materials to make widgets are also produced domestically.Now, Country B enters the scene. They want their own widget industry to thrive for whatever reason (maybe they have a powerful widget lobby, or maybe they're doing it for strategic reasons), so they start subsidizing their own widget producers. Let's say they give them a 20% subsidy. That means widget producers in B can now sell their widgets at way lower prices than A's widget producers can.If B allows its producers to export their widgets (exported widgets would usually be excluded from the subsidy specifically to prevent this kind of trade dispute), the world widget market would suddenly be flooded with artificially cheap, B-made widgets. Consumers in Country A start buying these cheaper widgets, causing the domestic widget industry to tailspin. That would be a good reason for Country A to slap a tariff on widget imports from Country B; increasing the price of B's widgets by 20% would eliminate their unfair price advantage, allowing the domestic widget industry to compete on an even field again. In that case, B's move to export subsidized widgets would be a hostile trade action, and the tariff would just be return fire. Failure to do so could have disastrous consequences for A's economy, since the failure of the widget industry could very easily cause an economic death spiral.* This is called ""dumping,"" and it is usually countered with tariffsThis current situation is totally different though:1) It isn't a tariff on one particular thing, but on a wide swath of products. The wider the tariffs are, the weirder, larger, and harder to predict the effects will be. Even without a reaction from China, chances are a lot of these tariffs would end up having serious negative consequences for the US. 2) In the case of the steel an aluminum tariffs, Trump wasn't totally wrong; China has arguably been dumping steel and aluminum in the US and other markets for decades. However, he seems to have missed the fact that the US is a massive metal *importer,* and our domestic steel and aluminum production industries are tiny compared to the industries that consume metals. What that means is Trump just jacked up the prices of the raw materials needed by a huge sector of the economy in order to protect the much, much smaller industries which produce those materials. What's more, the steel and aluminum industries also rely equipment produced by the metal consuming industries these tariffs are raising the prices on. That means that while it could theoretically help their sales, it will make buying new equipment way more expensive. And they're going to have to buy a lot of equipment, because they're going to have to increase production MASSIVELY to accommodate the increased demand for US made raw materials. Again, even without a response from China, Trump just shot himself in the dick with that one.3) A lot of the things we import from China are mass market consumer items, and a lot of the things China imports from us are luxury items. We buy things like machinery components (think radiators, switches, gears, belts, etc), basic consumer items (toothbrushes, straws, flashlights, computer keyboards, dildos, etc.), electronics (smartphones and PC components for days), and raw materials (steel, aluminum, lithium, rare earth metals, plastics, etc.). They buy stuff from us like cigars, motorcycles, whisky, and cars. They also buy commodities like soybeans, chemicals, wheat, etc, but there are plenty of other sources for those materials (although costs may rise somewhat). If rich Chinese people can't get reasonably priced American cigars and Harleys, they'll just buy Cubans and Triumphs instead. On the other hand, alot of the stuff Trump is placing tariffs on don't really have solid domestic pipelines to replace them. In summary, Trump barreled right past any potential diplomatic resolution to our trade disputes with China and jumped directly into a totally unnecessary trade war. Not only that, but the actions he's taking are extremely stupid even if you ignore the Chinese counterpunch. He's obviously convinced himself that he knows more about economics than the economists, and he's obviously the only person he has convinced of that.In fact, I'd like to revise my earlier analogy. This isn't like hurting your duplex neighbor by lighting your own roof on fire; this is more like taking vengeance on your roommate for eating your ice cream sandwiches by eating their leftovers, then lighting yourself on fire inside your own locked room. HA! *That* will show them. *Here's what I mean by ""death spiral:"" the collapse of the widget industry causes a reduction in tax revenues and a spike in unemployment simultaneously. The welfare system suddenly needs to support way more people than usual, but the government has less money to pay for it. At the same time, all those unemployed people stop spending money. That means less people buying things, and sections of the economy completely unrelated to widget production start to feel the strain as well. With reduced revenues and a huge glut of unemployed people looking for work, companies can't/don't need to pay their employees nearly as well, and wages start to tank. That further reduces revenue, and the cycle continues. It's a feedback loop:1) People spend less money and stop buying as many things.2) Companies reduce wages, lay people off, or close their doors due to reduced revenue3) Repeat.",2.5836437e-13,3.7008527e-30,1.1081244e-11,4.1198184e-16,2.335242e-12,9.407825e-17

ItzSnakeMeat,"This is coming from a perspective that business is redemptive no matter what. Not only that it ignores the fact that if this is a ""Trade War"" we already know it will be costly, the question is who will it be most costly to? There are certainly some positives to less cheap Chinese electronics being mass produced only to break and be replaced filling up our oceans and landfills with crap and forcing people to pay a higher premium for consumer goods they didn't need in the first place.

I have no affection for Trump at all but the left all the sudden turns up FOR big business it's seems when it might serve to degrade the Commander in Tweet. Maybe we should consider the ethical implications of promoting business that is likely not good in any other sense than dollars and cents.

Let's not be naive and examine tariffs as if their impetus and outcomes are purely economic. That is reductionist and a fool's game. I'm not qualified to speak more than somewhat broadly on America vs. China economic strategy but I think there's a decent chance the overall goal is to protect American economic hegemony globally in the long run. Trump is likely and idiot but that doesn't mean this was even his idea. Perhaps you could elaborate on how damaging this may be to China or at least the impact of this decision more broadly to economic alone? My understanding is the Chinese command economy has been producing the Lion's share of the world's debt and thus, a major hit to production could spiral the forced March of their economic engine into a ""death spiral"".",1.3138157e-08,2.4819548e-22,7.583376e-07,3.264931e-12,1.8252601e-08,1.7810597e-13

AtheistAustralis,"Yup. Trying to bring low value manufacturing jobs back to the US is like a the $1000/hr lawyer firing the kid next door from cutting his grass and doing it himself to save $5. Congratulations, you saved $5, but lost $2000 in the time it took you to do it yourself.What the US should be doing is keep importing cheap goods from China, and work on increasing the volume of high-value, high-profit exports to other countries (and China as well, naturally). Of course this relies on a highly educated and well trained workforce, which in turn relies on a huge investment in education. Oops.The US became the economic powerhouse of the world by expanding its manufacturing base massively when other countries didn't (or couldn't), putting them way ahead of the game in productivity. Having enormous stockpiles of easily extracted natural resources (hello oil!) also helped a lot. They stayed ahead by being one of the first to transfer into the new economy of high tech goods, software, service industries, R&D, finance and IP, while other countries were catching up with manufacturing. Now it seems the aim is to go back in the other direction again to ""regain"" manufacturing jobs. I can't wait until 2050, when 80% of the US workforce is back in agriculture again..",3.4269054e-10,9.4913895e-23,2.0823711e-07,6.379197e-12,6.5794072e-09,2.0420067e-13
Dworgi,"The biggest problem with this strategy (and don't get me wrong, it's a good strategy) is that it leaves behind the other half of the normal distribution. Not everyone can program or act in movies. Where Europe has differed while following the same strategy is that they have a social safety net, so there isn't as much backlash from rural regions and the uneducated. What's good for the economy is good for the safety net, which is good for them.You can see this exact phenomenon in European and American politics. Where Europe is overwhelmingly liberal and much less polarised, the US is completely divided. While Trump and his supporters have a misguided about the solution, they're not completely off base about the problem.Agricultural and manufacturing jobs are in stark decline, which threatens their way of life, but that's by design. Restoring coal and factory jobs seems like a logical solution, but it runs counter to the strategy.",8.250009e-15,1.8476729e-28,6.046451e-10,1.1733943e-15,2.1375186e-11,1.1028229e-16
Icemasta,"Well, the classic idea is that specialization of the population would help transition away from the need of manufacturing jobs and what not and that service jobs would cover the lower end, but that was with several assumptions that aren't happening. For instance, the rate of education and the cost of education was assumed to lower over time as the population grew more specialized, but we saw the opposite; education cost is rising, which creates stagnation. Lower specialization jobs such as service and manufacturing jobs are getting replaced by automation and corporate optimization faster than the specialized market is growing. It's not so say that countries aren't making progress there, just that it isn't happening evenly, so you get people that are left behind, or for the US, you get the ""hole in the middle"", where people of ""middle education"", like college, come out of school with large debts for salaries that aren't much better than minimum wage. Like right now, there is a sweet spot in trade jobs like plumber, electrician, etc... because of the aging population and those are the kind of things that can't be automated, it's also the kind of job that went unpopular for a long time thanks to mainstream media. It's an interesting thing to witness though. In the next 20 years, there will be big shifts in the job market.",3.2610942e-10,9.1320384e-21,2.527645e-07,1.4441536e-11,2.1827676e-08,1.1228339e-12

EngineerKE,"Yeah, but consider that the room for growth in Africa is huge. It's why the US and China are basically battling it out for control right now. Look at just how many countries the Chinese are investing in. As you've said, it's a tall order for the Chinese to find a market replacement for the US. But it's not really a path to replacement in as much as it is them hedging against US economic hegemony. With the recent intra-African free trade deal, assuming discipline is maintained between signatories, Africa's GDP is set to rise significantly over the next 2 decades or so. This makes it a ripe market for Chinese goods. While the US bars Huawei's telecoms technology, they find a big market in African countries in need of such infrastructure. And with the Chinese always playing the long game, their industries are set to find big markets in developing countries. That's their long-term target. Same thing with SE Asia. They're taking advantage of infrastructure needs in countries like Vietnam, the Philippines and Pakistan to expand their industries. Cutting loose dependency on the US off as a trading partner sounds far fetched when you look at it across the next 5 years. But once you start looking 20-30 years, factoring in growth of the African Economy, rise of Chinese geopolitical influence across the Indian ocean, Chinese infrastructure projects across developing countries and the subsequent influx of Chinese goods, the strategic network of Chinese funded/acquired ports, and the massive investment of critical infrastructure (rail and road networks) from resource-rich areas leading to China, you can see the likelihood of it happening.

SpeedrunNoSpeedrun,"Well, the US position has been that free trade is preferable. This is an attempt to push back on a trade imbalance. My understanding is that China has been gaming the system and imposing tarrifs and restrictions and not allowing free trade. The real problem is that this was allowed in the first place. So as far as I can tell if China were to be willing to open up trade and let it balance out then US would reciprocate. US steel has been decimated already by China flooding the market with subsidized steel while kmposing tarrifs in incoming steel. Other industries as well. So the answer to your question is most certainly it does hurt, but we've been the target of unbalanced trade for decades and this is what happens when something is done about it. It'd be nice if we open up completely free trade with some countries to offset the Imbalance while dealing with China. India for instance has just as many people and is friendly politically.

SovietBozo,"Uhhh, a few points...1) George Bush picked up votes in his second election. That means a non-trivial number of people who voted for Al Gore declined to vote for Kerry and switched to Bush instead. And this after Bush's first term which was pretty much a disaster. Trump will likely benefit from the same dynamic.2) When a party is in power for a full eight years, and people are ready for a change enough so that if there's a replacement from the other party, he also gets a full eight years. The one exception is Jimmy Carter (a poor campaigner, as Trump is not). Before that you have to go back to Grover Cleveland, and I'm not ever sure of that.3) Because of the above, *IF* the economy is doing decently, Trump will almost certainly be re-elected. Trumps *approval* rating is about 40%; virtually all those people will vote for Trump, and many people will be of the mind ""I don't approve of Trump at all, but I'm sure not going to vote for Kirsten Gillebrand"". On top of that you add any shenanigans, the fake-news stuff we saw in 2016, done even more cleverly. Sinclair controls the local news now, and a whole lot of people who don't watch Fox News or any news stuff do catch the 5:30 local news. There's no attempt to counter Russian influence, which by 2020 may very well include actual hacking of voting machines on a large scale. The electoral college favors Trump as we saw in 2016. The Koch Org and similar entities are rich and ruthless and have had that much more time to hone their technique. The Democrats don't have an obvious good candidate (Sanders and Warren are quite old and both have weaknesses) and will quite possibly select an uninspiring center-right Wall Street neo-liberal candidate like Kristen Gillibrand. Russian covert aid to Jill Stein will probably be even more extensive than in 2016. And so forth.So... as long as the economy is decent, I'd give 10-to-1 odds that Trump will win.Sorry.

LincolnTransit,"**Warning**: Article has a dumb auto play video. Text, without an annoying autoplay video can be found below: China announced additional tariffs on 106 U.S. products on Wednesday, in a move likely to heighten global concerns of a tit-for-tat trade war between the world's biggest economies.The effective start date for the new charges was not announced, though China's Ministry of Commerce said the tariffs are designed to target up to $50 billion of U.S. products annually.The 25 percent levy on U.S. imports includes products such as soybeans, cars and whiskey, Beijing said. The full list can be found here.**Trade showdown**The move comes less than 24 hours after President Donald Trump unveiled a list of Chinese imports that he aims to target as part of a crackdown on what he deems as unfair trade practices. Sectors covered by Trump's proposed tariffs include products used for robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.The trade showdown between Washington and Beijing has rattled investors and fueled market fears that the dispute could soon spiral into a full-blown trade war.When asked whether global markets were now officially observing an all-out trade war, Goldman Sachs' chief global equity strategist, Peter Oppenheimer, told CNBC: ""I think it is clearly a trade battle at the very least.""""I think the anxiety the market is reflecting is that it could escalate into a generalized (trade) war,"" he added.China's proposed countermeasures prompted U.S. stocks to plunge on Wednesday. The Dow Jones industrial average tanked more than 450 points, with Boeing and Caterpillar leading all stocks in the index lower.Meanwhile, Wednesday's announcement also prompted European stocks to extend losses, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 hitting a session low of 0.8 percent shortly after the news. ""I think Beijing is very keen to show that it is not going to be bullied, too,"" Neil Dwane, global strategist at Allianz Global Investors, told CNBC on Wednesday.""(China) is going to position this as them responding to American aggression rather than necessarily being part of the problem,"" he added. The Chinese yuan also suffered its biggest daily fall against the dollar in two weeks after the measures were proposed.

Anon4comment,"Maybe so. But I'm in Indonesia, which is a very pro-Japan country, and you should see the way Chinese tech is gaining popularity here. Everyone's buying Oppo, Vivo and Honor phones. Sure, Samsung and Sony and iphone are selling, but only to the upper middle class. That is dwarfed by the popularity of cheap Chinese goods among the new generation. Quite the same is happening in India. In fact, some of the really rich folk in India are abandoning apple in favour of buying an oppo and vivo every year. Still comes out cheaper.Wuling motors just launched in Indonesia and I've already seen plenty of their cars on the roads in Jakarta. Huawei and changhong are also gaining traction instead of LG. And sure, these are all cheap low-quality rip-offs of well-designed products made in other countries. It doesn't mean that China's not making a quick buck off this short-term sale and building an industrial base that's ready to compete with the west.When electric cars are launched in Indonesia, I absolutely expect the main competitors to be Japanese and Chinese companies, not any from Korea or western markets.

DapperDanManCan,"It's the structure of your sentence that conveys a different meaning than what you've intended. Here's your quote:""But to be fair they were confused when someone said UPS was part of the united states postal service so the bar was quite low.""What that says to most readers, especially with what you've prefaced it with, is that your boss was (rightfully) confused when someone claimed UPS was a part of the USPS, while you, the narrator of this story, believe he was confused due to being wrong. Since UPS is in fact a private company, anyone in the know would rightfully be confused by an obviously false statement.

sobrique,"It's both extremely easy and hideously complicated. The easy bit is - you buy a piece of a company. That company rewards you via dividends (sometimes) for the money you gave them. And if the company expands, the slice you bought expands too.That's really all there is to it. It gets complicated because the value of a company is actually pretty subjective. If there's a bad harvest coming, companies depending on that harvest might be expected to do worse this year, pay a lower dividend or not grow. The company itself is unchanged, but people want to sell their slice at a discount. Which makes the value look lower.

FranklinAbernathy,"Why are you under the impression that the United States is under the thumb of China? We are the largest importer of their goods and being that China's economy is largely propped up by exports, we have more leverage. If the United States we're to impose major tariffs on Chinese goods their economy would take a major blow, which the reporting they issue on their economic growth is largely bullshit and this is known throughout the world.Secondly, China already has tarriffs as high as 30% on American imports. China isn't a large importer of American goods so we don't have much to lose if they add more tariffs to our goods. Them putting more tariffs on our goods was a symbolic stunt for the American media to try and pressure Trump to back down because they already hate him. You've already taken the bait considering you're already referring to this as a trade war.Any effects from us telling China to cut the bullshit of placing tariffs on American goods, which they already do so again their announcement of tariffs in kind was bullshit, will be short lived as we have major trade agreements with numerous nations more than happy to fill the void. Just so you know, the EU is pretty close to being as big an importer to the U.S. as China and we don't have nearly the same trade deficit with them. Mexico and Canada are a bigger importer to the US than China if you combine the two.Our economy isn't going to collapse if we tell China to go fuck themselves; we would just have to pay more for a short period until those voids were filled by other exporters.

This is just a discussion.Anywho, my opinion seemed to be that the current trade situation would not end well because China has the better cards. This doesnt really change. They arent bowing to our interests. If they did, the easing on Auto import tarriff would have involved some of the other things that are important to us. We targeted end products that make their way to China. They targeted products that we need for our end products. If anything, something like the soybean would be better off being not being imported because it means the Chinese would be motivated to make their own, especially when it would now be cheaper to do so. It feels more like an indication that they aren't quite yet prepared for what the lack of US auto products would mean to China.

China doesnt wanna hurt Trump as a businessman, only as a politician and the same goes for Trump to the Chinese. This would make it so that Trump has an easier out than most other men in his situation, but it doesnt mean diddlysquat until Trump backs off his tariffs. Xi only warned about Cold Era tensions.

tritter211,"Bernie sanders and Donald Trump are populists in democrat and republican party respectively. Nearly every economist out there will tell you tariffs are bad. Why? Because if you win in one aspect, you lose in other aspect. Add it all, and you are basically at a net negative effect as a whole. For example, if certain american manufacturing is back thanks to the trade war, then US agricultural farmers and dairy farmers, and poultry farmers will lose. In this scenario, do you consider it as winning? Populists usually promise the moon to get votes. Just because bernie sanders is a democrat doesn't mean his policy positions are sound or rooted in reality. just like how Donald Trump is not building the wall, if bernie won the presidency, he probably isn't going to follow through with his insane promises. The structure of US government doesn't allow for that kind of promises to happen in short term. Tariffs sound good in paper, but the general population doesn't care about the complexities of trade deals that take into account the whole country. A coal miner is not going to give a shit about solar energy worker when given a chance.

JarJarDidNuffinWong,"Generally both countries benefit from trade, China just might be benefitting more proportionally. This is because trade allows both countries' markets to specialize in what they are good at. Otherwise US has to spend more resources to i.e. mining rare Earth elements or making steel, which US is not as good at as China. Or China has to spend more resources on universities, financial services, or pharma, which US is better at.Trade deficits are not bad either. You have a massive trade deficit with your grocery store, for instance. It's not a bad thing as long as you make more money than you spend there. You get to specialize in what you are good at (i.e. your job), the grocery store gets to specialize on what it is good at (i.e. providing food and everyday items).The example scales up.

ZTLee,"""I'm guessing the Trump administration wants to get far more out of the Chinese than merely new understandings on steel, aluminum, intellectual property rights, and North Korea. The White House appears set to link a host of until-now unlinked issues. Issues like agriculture and freedom of navigation, manufacturing and the South China Sea, finance and hacking, market access and policies on Iran, reciprocity and Russian sanctions. It is a heavy list and even if the Chinese were to simply roll over on it all (which is not very likely) it would take quite a bit of time to work out the details. In my opinion, folks convinced of the Chinese rise aren't very good at math or reading maps. The Chinese financial system is the most overextended in history and every country that has followed its investment-led model has eventually crashed hard. The one-child policy has destroyed China's future – it is now the world's third-fastest aging demography. China's strategic position is horrid – a line of islands parallels its coast, preventing it from projecting power into the sea lanes upon which its economy depends. It is utterly reliant on global energy imports and global merchandise exports – imports and exports which are under the thumb of the U.S. Navy. The linkage the Americans are about to impose is the opposite of what the Chinese have become used to the Americans doing. It is precisely what the Chinese do to everyone else whenever the issue of Hong Kong or Taiwan or Tibet comes up. The Chinese are going to hate/fear this sort of strategic thinking in the United States because it cuts to the heart of the Chinese political system and strategic policy. And there's far more to this than Beijing knowing they lack the leverage on the Americans to win. The Americans are in effect putting a dollar amount on their Korean alliance, and the same thing can now be done to any other aspect of American policy – including the China relationship.""

The damage china can do with tarrifs and even currency influence is far greater then the damage we can do to them. How will this be an ""easy to win"" trade war. For those who just don't get it. This president doesn't know what he's doing or what he's talking about the vast majority of the time.

CivilServiced,"A tariff is an additional tax. When goods from country A are subject to an import tariff in country B, it makes them more expensive overall in country B. This means less of that good will be purchased in country B if there are cheaper alternatives domestically or frm other countries.One market response is that prices of the good fall due to lower demand. Imagine you are a farmer and typically sell $2 million of soybean crops per year. Now you have the same amount of soybeans, but you will only be able to sell them for $1.25 million. People also invest in commodities futures, which is essentially betting on future values of those commodities. Those people are losing large quantities of value with sudden drops, just like drops in the stock market.Since tariffs can artificially raise the cost of imports, they can be used to encourage purchase of domestic goods, domestically and/or internationally (via more complex trade agreements). However, enacting tariffs is seen as a hostile action against a current trade partner, as shown above, and can be retaliated against in turn with tariffs on goods from the offending country.

ed_merckx,"the tarrifs Trump has proposed take something like 6 months before they can actually go into effect, and for the ones he's proposed the EU, Canada and Mexico is exempt from the majority of it. I really think this is about bringing china to the table and get some agreement about them actually enforcing IP protection, anti-dumping and perhaps getting some concessions on foreign policy. The economy really is the place you can pressure china, as the government in power controls the media they are immune to pretty much everything, but one thing you can't lie to the people about is strength of your economy, eventually people take a look at their bank account and realize you're lying. And you can get away with significantly less shit when the economy is bad. So from a negotiations point of view I can kind of understand what Trump's doing, although he keeps rambling about the raw numbers of the trade deficit (never mind we have a very large surplus when it comes to exporting services) for some idiotic reason instead of pointing out the violations China does.He didn't even do a halfway decent job of explaining the steel/aluminum tarrifs which is one of the more black and white areas of china doing stuff that does hurt US and other domestic industry. Basiclly our output of these has continued to decrease (we are at something like 65% of production capacity, where as we were in the low 80%'s I think before the recession) while global demand has increased. The main reason is that during things like a recession or natural slumps in the commodities markets, US output naturally decreases. However when the economic cycle changes and demand/prices come back up to the point where we should have production increase it doesn't. Because during this time when we had to shut down production for economic reasons, china via massive government subsidies kept their output the same or even increased it. Not to mention we've got the added cost of putting production back on line. In the case of steel/aluminum specifically only something like 40,000 new jobs (I could be off on that number though) would come back if we get our production as a percentage of total capacity back to historical highs, meanwhile the industry has shaved off hundreds of thousands of jobs over the last decade. Telling me that a limited amount of those job losses are the direct result of dumping, and most are a result of efficiency increases in production methods, IE automation. Not that I agree with subsidies, but if Trump's end goal is just to bring back those 40k jobs that were lost because of dumping then just pushing a government subsidy would be a much less damaging way of doing so and he'd be much more effective in bringing these jobs back if he passes infrastructure spending and continuing to peel back inefficient regulations that do nothing except reduce our productivity, specifically in the manufacturing and industrial sectors. For the record though I don't think our infrastructure is in that bad shape when it comes to his rhetoric of ""it's all falling apart"", and you should worry when both parties use these buzzwords for cover of massive infrastructure bills funded by debt spending like Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc, etc all eventually propose. Because ""hey! it's our infrastructure, you're right we should always be fixing it"". Yes, there are areas that need spending directed, but overall it's not in that bad shape. Trump could easily show that with clear numbers, and pressure china. Or on things like theft of IP. instead he focuses on raw numbers like the total trade deficit. I hope his advisers are going to take this route and plan to use the mandatory wait time until the tariffs actually take place to negotiate and get concessions, it's what our government should do, and past administrations were complete pussies when it came to deal with china malfeasance on trade, shit even Europe took a very proactive approach to protect against inefficient trade practices in some areas. But the tarrifs are one area where trump alone, at the end of the day can cause some major damage. All this noise about Russia, ""how america sees us"" whether the presidency is respected by upper class people in new York, all that shit gets overblown to be the end of the world every day when it's really not that big of a thing, government is a massive machine that keeps churning.

ed_merckx,"> American Society of Civil EngineersSo not to say that they don't have good analysis, but they are a trade group that represents Engineers, so they have a natural bias to push for spending bills that would give their members work. My point on infrastructure was less that we don't need new investment in things like public transportation (heavy rail around major metropolitan areas instead of stopgap measures like lane widening on highways for example) for new development, especially in the areas seeing massive population growth, but rather this idea that our current infrastructure is totally falling apart and is some ticking time bomb. It just feeds into this all or nothing political stratedgy that both sides practice, sell the panic and then put some massive spending bill when we maybe need half that, or in many cases much of the funds go to areas that don't need it. A big problem with some infrastructure development and/or repairs, especially in major cities, is unfortunately how large the bureaucracy is in these places. It's exponentially harder to get something built in the bay area than say Cleveland or Phoenix. Look at airports and transport run by the port authority in the Manhattan/NJ area. I used to live/work in the city and Newark airport is the same shithole it was 10 years ago, but any updates to it require so much bureaucratic oversight, appeasing dozens of different groups, environmental stuff, unions that have a vested interest in not changing things, horrible contracts that they are stuck in from 20 years ago, etc. Where as compare that to some of the cities in the Midwest and south that have seen massive new growth with large companies putting their new regional HQ's there, and they can do large infrastructure development in relatively fast times.The de-regulation especially at places like the department of the interior, department of transpiration, EPA, really is one area he should be getting way more credit for, but we are so hyper-politicized and media only wants to demonize and sell fear on everything. Remove a 20 year old environmental rule that studies have shown has done zero to reduce Co2 emissions and does nothing but add increased delays and costs to building a road, and the headlines read ""trump destroying environment by removing protections"". And I don't want to sound like some far-right conspiracy person, rather that people don't read beneath the surface of headlines very often, and give in to rampant speculation. In the US, politicians love to do things that make government bigger, even republicans. They talk about how much they want smaller government, how we aren't like all those ""socialist European countries"", blah blah. Yet they fund and support some of the largest socialized programs and bureaucracies in the world. And specifically in the last 20 years, D's and R's both found that it was easy to kind of sneak by increases to the federal government by expanding the federal agencies. So you can pass increased rules that might only benefit one large donor in say the construction industry, by requiring two more large environmental impact studies, even though the 5 you already have to do are more than enough, but by adding these two extra ones it pushes out a lot of competition when it comes to bidding for these contracts. I saw this firsthand in NYC with large development, and how many of these huge building companies support ultra restrictive land use and zoning laws, but the CEOs are very republican. Like you think to yourself, ""why would the CEO of a pipeline company support more environmental regulations""? Then you realize the regulations they lobby for have nothing to do with C02 emissions or actually protecting the environment, but just adding more layers of legal work you have to go through, which is nothing for a multi-billion dollar corporation, but for the small local builder with a staff of 20, no in house legal team, it's just another barrier to entry. To circle back to China, I think these will work in a way. China would feel much more impact from a ""Trade war"" than the US, at least in the sense of looking at the current state of their economy. The government is doing everything in their power to keep high gdp growth (its 6.7% now, and they want it higher), and taking on massive deficits to do so. They've already seen GDP fall from the 10%+ range which is natural, because economies can't stay in rapid expansion forever, and eventually settle back down to reasonable growth in the 3-5% range. While a squeeze to our economy might stagnate it, we are already planning on seeing large GDP growth from the de-regulation and tax cuts, and as someone who works in the investment industry, our fears of a trade war are more the worries of the effect on the stock market, and in terms of GDP worries that it might make some of the growth not as good as we were expecting. Read that as none of us see a $5 billion hit here or there from tarrifs as sending us into a recession, but rather maybe we see 4.12% gdp growth instead of 4.15% for 2019. Which isn't a good thing, but we still have a very positive outlook on the US economy. Where as when it comes to china, it's not that at all. Not to say we see china going into a recession or anything, but we don't see them getting back to double digit GDP growth anytime soon. Also when it comes to Trump, he seems to be the person that wants to just take any victory, even if it's way less than what he origionally wanted. Look at taxes, immigration, healthcare reform, etc. It all starts out as ""I want the biggest reform and change to the system we've ever seen"", $25 billion for a wall, and total overhaul of the current immigration system, and then he's willing to accept just a little extra funding for border security with no major changes to the current process. Or taxes, wanted corporate at 10-15% bare minimum and wouldn't go higher, but then settled on 22% corporate rate. If china came to him and gave him some minor concessions, appologized for companies stealing IP and promising to work harder to stop it, maybe agree to build one less artificial island or something, maybe it costs them a few billion over the next year or so, but in reality nothing changes, Trump would probably accept it. Because he can then go back and say ""look I got the greatest bestest deal of all time with china when no one else could""! when in realty nothing really changed.",9.949884e-09,1.6175835e-24,1.7719139e-10,3.4438793e-12,9.988855e-11,1.0028532e-12

China is fucking enormous, it is hill and tree country, lots and lots of marshland, and they have a *huge* population of people. You think Vietnam was bad, you ain't seen nothing if you want to try and take down China. Our navy (purely the navy, not the combined airforces that use the navy as staging areas/bases) can't even reach most of the country in force projection regarding their guns - which means it's going to be an air and ground war. As that goes, imagine the US Forces being asked to 'hold down and ensure victory' on literally the entire United States - because that's about what it'd be to ask them to take and hold China.The only thing China would need to do to win such a war is to shut down the flow of supplies and the military forces there would eat themselves. Supplies that must be shipped from overseas by plane or boat - supplies that come from nearly half the world away. Meanwhile, China has plenty of anti-air capability - and lots more if they conscript Japan into it who might feel obligated to do so if we're brazenly attacking China of all places.It's simply and flatly a bad idea. It would be an extremely god damn bloody war, our economy would be in tatters from overexertion, and our military forces would be strained to the breaking point fighting on such uneven terms. The last thing we should want to do is repeat the folly of Germany's stupidity in attempting to attack Russia.Meanwhile, while we're on an adventure in China that's costing us dearly, Russia's got the green light to do whatever the hell it wants because the US has already been forced to over-commit and over-extend to win a land war in china.

OnABusInSTP,"I'll try explaining basic economics to you one last time. China is able to produce many consumer goods at a lower opportunity cost than the US. Why? Because China doesn't have the same level of technological sophistication as the US. The US is able to produce the same consumer goods as China (and even more efficiently than China), but that would mean our capital and labor are going toward production that is less valuable than it otherwise could have been. That's called an opportunity cost. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in terms of productive efficiency for most goods over China, China has a comparative advantage in comparison to the US. This idea of opportunity cost holds true for most individuals. Farmers and grocery stores have a comparative advantage in providing people food over people providing their own food for themselves. Thus, you go to the store. It might be possible for everyone to grow their own food, but most people earn more doing something else with their time. As to the other things you said, we already have anti-dumping tariffs on China in regards to steel. In fact, China exports a small amount of steel to the United States. China does steal IP. Instead of starting an open-ended trade war, which is what Trump has done, we are better off requiring American companies to engage in protective IP practices if they do business in China. And we are better off coordinating anti-IP theft practices with the international community to maximize pressure on China. Unfortunately, that's the opposite of what Trump has done.",4.734472e-12,2.9290042e-20,7.545026e-09,1.0869801e-10,2.1818443e-07,2.0476067e-10

Just because ball bearings are manufactured in China cheaper today than anywhere else at the moment does not mean it's inefficient or wrong to plan to make ball bearings in the USA or tax import into the USA. Ball mills are a field of study. Manufacturing engineering is a field of study. Labor costs are studied. Mining, Energy, Market projections... Hundreds of variables must be considered before you can accurately project ""Opportunity Cost"".

China's import taxes on cars have been around since 2001, when the industry was relatively new to China (new industries are often allowed protection in their infancy so they can get off the ground.) We should work with our allies to sign multi-lateral trade deals that force them to bring down barriers. Once again, this is the opposite approach that Trump has taken.

blackwarrior1105,"when some people talk about a deficit, they don't really understand how the economy works. US government wants a DEFICIT, because US wants US dollar to be world currency. Just simply think about it for one second, if you want the other nation uses your currency and only yourself can produce US dollar, how could other nations get US dollar??? The only way is US has a DEFICIT which means buy more goods and give US dollar to other countries. US long purpose is to gain more goods and let the worldwide have to use US dollar. After that, US government can easily change the value of US dollar to let the other country losing the actual value of production by making more US dollar.I am surprised that many people don't even know if US dollar wants to be the worldwide currency, there must be a deficit.",2.9955521e-10,1.2193934e-21,1.2845743e-07,2.3211428e-12,2.9729679e-09,2.2330677e-13

A state that Obama won in 2012 by 350,000 votes, Clinton lost by roughly 10,000. Why? She received 300,000 votes less than Obama did in 2012. Detroit and Wayne County should kick themselves because of the 595,253 votes they gave Obama in 2012, only 518,000 voted for Clinton in 2016. Mote than 75,000 Motown Obama voters did not bother to vote for Clinton! They did not become Trump voters – Trump received only 10,000 votes more than Romney did in this county.

They also share the blame for whoever is elected because they consistently don't care, or don't bother to educate themselves. But they have the same blame they always do, but the liberals who didn't vote because they wanted Bernie now share in that blame too, and they did it not because they're uneducated but because many of them were bitter.

These are all Nimitz-class carriers, meaning they are a class of super-carriers that can hold about 90 planes each, travel at around 30 knots, and house 2 nuclear reactors for propulsion. **These motherfuckers can go over 20 years without refueling!** That means the US has 10 mobile air force bases that essentially never rests. The US is the undisputed Queen Bitch of the seas.And that's only the carriers. Globally, there are 28 Cruisers and 150 Destroyers.

Technologically, the Russians have come out with an almost equivalent air fighter but the US has a much larger air force and the logistical capability to fight anywhere efficiently.* As if all these conventional weapons aren't enough, the US's nuclear capabilities are mind-boggling. Everyone knows the US and Russia generally have the same amount of nuclear weapons (around 5,000) but the US's delivery systems are unparalleled. The US holds 71 of 134 total nuclear powered submarines in the world. Out of these 71, 18 are Ohio-class. These are capable of holding 24 Trident SLBM missiles that each hold up to 8 MIRV (multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle) nuclear warheads. Each of these MIRV warheads hold a firepower of 100 kilotons of TNT. **That means each of these subs could hold 24 missiles that can each separate into 8 nuclear warheads, totaling 192 warheads, each with a range of 4,600 miles. That means a sub off of NYC could hit Anchorage. You read that right. We essentially have 18 mobile nuclear launch bases that can move underwater.**Say there is knowledge of an impending nuclear attack by, say, North Korea. Suppose that US satellites saw North Koreans fueling the missiles and that they were going to launch a warhead.

Patents in the US are public, in order to patent something, you need to explain what you're trying to patent in full detail, and how it works. For example, [here](https://patents.google.com/patent/US8040326B2/en?assignee=Apple+Inc) is Apple's patent for the touchscreen of the original iPhone back in 2007. A Chinese company can come along, see what Apple did, and make their own. They are similar, though not exactly, like blueprints. It's more like an ingredient list. There is also corporate espionage, where insider information is stolen and then utilized for manufacturing purposes. [Chinese spies have been stealing corporate secrets](https://www.thecipherbrief.com/chinese-industrial-spies-cast-a-wider-net) for some time now.In the US, Apple is protected against other companies stealing their designs by looking at the patent and corporate espionage because they hold the ""rights"" to that patent for a certain amount of time. Only Apple, and companies Apple gives permission, can do what Apple did. Chinese companies don't have to follow US law, so they can steal that intellectual property, figure out how to manufacture it, and then sell it, all without the billions spent of that initial research that Apple had to do to get that patent.For your reference, [U.S. accuses China of stealing patents in WTO complaint](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-trade-wto/u-s-accuses-china-of-stealing-patents-in-wto-complaint-idUSKBN1GZ1BV?il=0)>“China appears to be breaking WTO rules by denying foreign patent holders, including U.S. companies, basic patent rights to stop a Chinese entity from using the technology after a licensing contract ends,” the U.S. Trade Representative's office said in a statement.",1.094862e-10,4.5827005e-24,8.366964e-10,5.3671905e-13,3.686019e-10,2.2254906e-13

Auxilae,"> Who enforces these patent laws?The [Patent Cooperation Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_Cooperation_Treaty) provided the framework for 'protecting' international patents. It does not offer enforcement, it is a treaty, similar to other treaties, it just means ""we'll respect you, if you respect us"".There isn't a one world government that can control who can actually make anything. If you're in Nowhere-stan and wanted to make and sell an iPhone in Nowhere-stan, then there isn't going to be police showing up to stop you. However, it is in the best interests for individual countries if the patents of their citizens are protected, this applies mostly for international brands like the iPhone. Except if you're China. Chinese companies will often look at the publicly-published patents, find out exactly how to build it from it, create a product that is eerily similar, use cheap labor (average factory worker's salary in China is $4,755) by exploiting workers in terrible working environments, then undercut the international competition who spent billions in research to build it. That is what has been going on.The gist is that if you make a patent for an international product, other countries will ""respect"" that, like a treaty (hence the words patent treaty). There is no enforcement, but countries have the ability to retaliate against repeat offenders, in this case, tariffs. Is it the *right* decision?, some economists say yes, others say no. I'm not here to tell you that it's a good or bad idea, you can figure that with your own research and opinion forming. I'm just here telling people that Trump did *not* start this.

China isn't going to put its hands up on the IP issue unless it is worked out diplomatically. Especially not now, this is evident.

They'll hurt Americans equivalently.There is one world leader rubbing his hands together at this fact. **Putin.

Then when you crown yourself President for life, people get scared.Many 中国人 I know believe that Xi cares too much about economic growth and is willing to sacrifice long-term outlooks to gain short term growth.The Bohai Strait project is a perfect example of him doing exactly that.There is a reason the meme of Winnie the Pooh eating honey with the caption ""find something you love and stick to it"" was circulating Weibo and WeChat.

I am not saying if this is the right or wrong way to do it for the US, as I said i am looking at this from a economic perceptive. what we know now is that foreign stocks are performing really well compared to domestic US stocks lately. Over time tariffs may contribute to a better US economy when trade can balance more in the the favor of the US, though it will with certainty sting initially. This will hurt people close to retirement, obviously and that is a very real crisis.Most stocks on the market are currently very overvalued from my knowledge as well. We are probably reaching the tail end of a bull market, tariffs or not. This will let younger people get better returns in the decades down the road when the market balances more in the US favor **if the tariffs correct trade imbalances**.

Hiriko,"It's basically a tax that the Chinese government will place on the products being imported for their own consumers.So say there's a 25% tariff placed on US cars. A US car company is trying to export their products to China. When exporting product you have to list the value of the product you are trying to sell. So say the cars are worth $10,000 each. A 25% tariff will increase the price of the cars to $12,500. So when the middle man in China wants to secure a supply of cars, instead of buying them for $10k each they have to buy them at $12.5k each. The extra $2500 tariff is taken by the Chinese government and the $10K price belongs to the US company.The way this is bad is because it it drive away consumers. The middle man will have to raise their own prices or operate at a loss. With such high tariffs, they are way more likely to just switch supply. So in my example a company in China will just try to find another supplier of similar cars who would not have the tariff placed, which means the US company will have a very hard time finding Chinese buyers.EDIT: The US company can also lower the price on the cars to work around the tariffs, but that obviously hurts them. So to get around a 25% tariff and allow the Chinese consumer to buy the cars at $10k, the US company has to drop the value of their car to $8000.

redline42,"Presidential Authority over Trade:Imposing Tariffs and Dutieshttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44707.pdfhere is the mission of the WTO The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only global international organization dealing with the rules of trade between nations. At its heart are the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by the bulk of the world's trading nations and ratified in their parliaments. The goal is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and freely as possible.I do not believe the WTO has any say in this matter due to no formal trade agreements signed between China and the United States. The WTO could hear disputes on these tariffs but it would take many years to come to a settlement. The tariffs are being created as leverage to negotiate a fair deal with China and to get China to play fair. Either by opening their market to American goods like the US market is open to Chinese goods and to stop stealing American Intellectual Property by forcing companies that want to trade to disclose their products and their practices. This is a battle not a war. If anything it is merely a skirmish. If you noticed the Chinese are targeting products from states and corporations that support the President. A shrewd move meant to put pressure on him. I look at this as a gamble that will backfire because the goods the US is putting tariffs on are goods that China needs to move out to prevent oversupply and value depreciation. The Steel tariffs will directly hurt the Chinese economy due to its subsidizing the companies in that industry. That debt will not go away and be as much of a burden as the debt incurred in the Ghost Cities. At the same time, the US doesn't consider nuts and coffee vital domestic exports like they do with Computers and Airplanes. Yes they account for around $21 billion in agriculture trade they are not going to starve themselves. Are all these tariffs helpful? Probably not but they are at least a signal that the US is serious about fair trade and China needs to start complying to world norms. One issue with American companies over the last 35 years is their over dependence on the ""1 billion"" customers in China and not the rest of the world. This is coming to hurt them.

FblthpLives,"> Presidential Authority over Trade: Imposing Tariffs and Duties The fact that tariffs can be imposed, does not mean the President routinely controls or interferes in trade.> I do not believe the WTO has any say in this matter due to no formal trade agreementsThis is incorrect.> The WTO could hear disputes on these tariffs but it would take many years to come to a settlementWhen the U.S. imposed steel tariffs in March 2002, the EU, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, Switzerland, and Brazil filed a dispute with the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. The ruling against the United States came in November of the same year, wich means it took 8 months or less.> This is a battle not a warThe tariffs imposed by China affect nearly 40% of U.S. exports to China.> I look at this as a gamble that will backfire because the goods the US is putting tariffs on are goods that China needs to move out to prevent oversupply and value depreciationThe U.S. will lose this trade war just as it lost in 2002 (and for the same reasons).> Probably not but they are at least a signal that the US is serious about fair trade and China needs to start complying to world normsThe tariffs imposed by Trump are universal and apply to all nations except Mexico and Canada.

Sogdiana,"I think in this case it hurts both as the trade for example in soy beans happened because China was paying the 'right price' and USA was selling for the 'right price' times the quantity. Now that China has imposed tariffs on imports it means it will be cheaper for soy bean importers in China to avoid tariffs and buy from the runner up soy bean exporter after USA, which is likely to be slightly more expensive. So in the end Chinese importers pay a little bit more than optimal for soy beans and soy bean exporters in USA sell their produce for a little bit less to a different country. Which means both parties are negatively impacted. But the impact is unlikely to be as dramatic as some commenters in the thread would like to present.But if the supply and demand of the good is rare e.g. mars shuttles then the impact is huge on both sides.

The costs of production are lower for a reason. When you export the labor, you cut the purchasing power out of the economic base. For decades the U.S. has been losing industry because of regulation.

Here are a few quick examples:https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227362598_Externalities_and_Free_Trade_Agreementshttp://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/education_materials/modules/Trade_and_the_Environment.pdfhttp://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/019251298019004001I think the question is why tariffs are not often viewed as a solution despite awareness of and discussion on environmental externalities.

I don't want to ""bamboozle"" you with discussions of international law, so I guess I won't go there to the extent I can avoid it.I'd feel more comfortable if these tariffs were imposed with a specific negotiation position that China could achieve more cheaply than the cost of the tariffs (unless the United States honestly thought it could argue from some sort of moral imperative to China). I don't see that in the tariffs imposed; I see this idea that this is supposed to help America get back to 'winning,' by somehow revitalizing our steel and aluminum industries, the remainder of those industries reliant on certain exports from China (or elsewhere) to do the work they still do domestically.I've also seen discussion of theft of American IP, which is a huge issue (but again likely would need some form of treaty or international court the parties could not walk away from in litigating those disputes).I understand your argument, and it has some intuitive appeal. I'm not inclined to believe it will work absent very clear proposed changes for China to undertake (preferably those that would be cheaper than China eating the cost of the tariffs, and cheap enough for China to decide it's not worth trying out the temporary tariff war to see if the United States will back down). I'm skeptical of moral high ground arguments or appeals to China altering the economics of any analysis in China changing its regulations or other policies.I'm also not inclined to believe the currently imposed sanctions have much, if anything to do with the points you have made. The United States is not going to bring back American Steel and Aluminum jobs from these tariffs. The United States likely is not going to resolve IP issues with China through these kinds of sanctions (and the current sanctions don't appear to target anything related to IP theft concerns, anyway). Why tax solar panels and washing machines? Is there IP theft there? Or is that just to try to do damage (while also not upsetting one's political base, a portion of whom might think solar panels are a joke). Perhaps there are IP concerns in the aerospace industry and medical supply industry, but nothing there looked particularly remarkable to me (as in, relates to patent infringement of some kind).Perhaps the current administration will become more refined and granular about their goals and approach in due time.

john22544,"I have a few thoughts on this. First of all nobody wins in a trade war. Secondly most people agree that China has been kind of screwing over the West on trade, but everybody is afraid to do anything about it. Thirdly that the majority of vocal redditors would like to see China badly hurt the United States if it is bad for Trump. I have another thought here. I think China just blinked. A lot of people are looking at this like a tit-for-tat because the Chinese proposed tariffs are roughly equivalent to Trump's proposed tariffs. But given the trade imbalance it is more like China just went all in. The DOW has already recovered half of what it lost. Soybeans have already recovered half of what they lost. So maybe I'm not the only one thinking along these lines. I hate Trump's style. I can't stand the man. And I wish he weren't President. And I am very scared that he is going to fuck up and crash the economy.

SegoLilly,"It is true that China has been cheating and stealing for a long, long time, and on that note I am glad it is being addressed at last. I am not enthused about the methodology however.Were it up to me, I would just start collecting paper. Lots of it. Proof of China's cheating and massive intellectual property theft, and then I would publish it. If the emperor won't walk down the street with no clothes on, then take his pants down. The data dump would be YUUUGE. It would be multilingual. It would name a lot of names. More on this later.Next step, there would be a lot of Chinese nationals getting the boot from the USA. Can't speak English worth a damn and lied about your abilities to get into college?Buh-bye! Law's changed! Adios! Using real estate to hide illicit money from the government?-It is ours now. The money you smuggled out of China was ill gotten gains to begin with and violated the law. But-new law- you compounded it by buying property that you had no intention of residing in and solely wanted to use as a slush fund. The US is not in the business of letting that property collect dust and rot when a large generation needs housing NOW. Using your plane ticket for birth tourism?-You have a court date and your child's citizenship can be revoked, since in truth you and your family do not give a damn about this country and are no better than conmen. You are only giving birth here to take advantage of laws meant for residents of the US who are culturally American and want to go to college. It is not the US's problem that China has a corrupt university system and not our job to subsidize your kid's education if he didn't make it through the gaokao. GET IN LINE.Getting back to the paper, every illegal deal, every violation of the WTO going back to 1989, and every embarassing detail of how party officials and Chinese companies REALLY operate would get dumped in multiple languages around the planet. I would move in for the kill and tell the tech monopolies in CA that they'd better get used to the idea of manufacturing anywhere but China and behind the scenes I would work on incentives to bring back more factories HERE. (I would also detail the Chinese dealings of Steve Jobs. I have a feeling they are dirty.) I would then flood the WTO with multiple instances of fraud and corruption. As for tariffs, they'd find that I have another report on my desk regarding pollution...and a little red button that I can push if I decide to dump more data. Tick tock, CCP. Tick tock..",4.956513e-11,1.6866817e-21,8.986798e-08,9.553905e-12,2.702692e-07,8.577192e-12

SegoLilly,"I would create an acid test just for that case, and make crystal clear within the language that the law is not to be applied to other groups as its purpose is to stop the corruption of Chinese birth tourism.It is very simple.It is a test. It has more than one edition and its answers get changed regularly for each edition. On the test are very simply questions about law, culture, and history. It would have an oral section and a written one. You can't write in Chinese-English only. You also automatically fail if you do not speak a word of English and it combines with you having no record of ever living anywhere in the US full time for a prolonged period. Example question: Who beat the Japanese and did most of the fighting in WWII, the Kuomingtang or Mao's Red Army?*Chinese nationals have been lied to for generations about this. Mao hid like a rat and let Chiang Kai Shek take the hit in numbers so he could finish him off once the Japanese left. This question is by design: it proves where someone was educated. And political beliefs. The Chinese government is unlikely to change their textbooks anytime soon, and it would be difficult for them to protest the truth on a test.*There would also be a very simple question for someone to answer: ""have you or any member of your family, immediate or otherwise, had any business or political ties with the CCP?"" If they lie, buh-bye! A lot of these people DO have those ties. The CCP in practice indirectly owns most businesses in China.The point of it would be to prove how connected you are to the USA. If you cannot speak the language at all, if you know zip about any US film save for what the CCP has allowed to be screened, if on paper the only thing you seem to care about is getting to college, that is it. Do not pass go, do not collect $200. The Chinese government can scream like toddlers about the Chinese Exclusion Act Take Two, but silkily the reply will be, ""You always say 'do not meddle in our internal affairs!' whenever the world does not like what you do. We're returning the same message this time. And by the way, reform the gaokao and actually build more universities and stop paying for sex from 21 year old girls who should be in school and not whoring themselves out to gross old men like imperial concubines.""It would be sweeter when a sudden hack on WeChat gets through long enough for the entire message to flow through China like a torrent through Niagara Falls. And a virus opens up a rather humiliating file that shows a CCP member in flagrante delicto with a young girl... and video of exactly HOW MANY OF THESE GIRLS HE HAS ON THE SIDE AT A TIME WHEN THE BIRTH RATIO IN CHINA IS INSANELY SKEWED. (The message behind the scenes to the others on the Central Committee would be to think carefully about what they do next. Unlike the Soviet Union, we don't live in a time where information is transmitted in manila folders and written on typewriters. We should take advantage of that and more aggressively try to break through the Great Wall with the truth.)",2.4154997e-12,1.365633e-24,5.320347e-09,1.3100138e-13,5.7914606e-10,1.9653216e-14

kocorin,"It wasn't senseless though. It is a stupid move, but a meaningful one. China has been abusing trade rules for decades. They already have restrictions and tariffs( they have a 25% tax on foreign cars) on many American goods for a long time now. Forcing companies to give up IP, banning certain companies outright, so their domestic company can have no competition. Foreign companies have to form 50/50 ventures with local Chinese companies (many owned by the Chinese govt). This usually ends up with the Chinese company stealing all the know hows and compete with the foreign company. That's what happen to two high speed train manufacturer. Siemens(Germany) and kawasaki(japan), formed joint ventures in China with local chinese companies. Did they make money? yes, but after a few years the very same chinese companies were expanding and selling designs identical to the Germans and Japanese. The bottom line is, China does not follow most of the rules that everyone else follows. They will do whatever it takes to get their hands on foreign IPs. That's the main reason why President Obama worked so hard to try and get the TPP to pass. It formed an alliance with other countries and tried to force the Chinese into submission.
