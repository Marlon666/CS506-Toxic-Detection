I should've just explained how gun violence is vastly overstated and over-reported, primarily because it fits a lot of people's, including the mainstream media's, preferred narrative (and most importantly it makes them money, if it bleeds it leads or whatever the saying is).The CDC found that 61% of firearm related deaths are suicides and out of the approximate 30,000 some people that die per year from guns, they estimated that up to 2.5 million people save their own lives by using a firearm.

In my country you are more likely to be beat to death with a blunt object like a baseball bat, than be shot by an assault rifle.",0.20722519,0.00015013303,0.22990291,0.0006827345,0.026344923,0.0018437892

THExLASTxDON,">Last I checked australians have like 0.14 guns per person while the USA has 1.01 per person.For sure, but then there is countries like Switzerland which also have very loose gun laws and a high rate of gun ownership, yet their gun violence is extremely low. I feel like that is a good example that can be used to prove that the inanimate object isn't the problem.Also, we can even ignore other countries (because it's kind of hard to compare with the differences in culture, the way crimes are reported, etc.). There isn't a single peer reviewed study that shows more guns = more crime. I've been linked blog posts, 8th grade book reports, etc. that'll say stuff like ""If you have a gun in your home you are more likely to be shot by one."", which is the equivalent of saying ""If you drive a vehicle, you are more likely to be in a car accident."" or ""If you live in a two story house, you are more likely to fall down stairs."". I feel like if guns really were the problem and they make you more likely to be a victim of crime, then that would be easy to prove.>but you guys do have states where citizens rock around with a sidearm openly carried and to me that's insane.I definitely understand how that could scare people, but I promise you, those aren't the people you have to worry about shooting you. You don't even have to trust me on that either, just look up the stats. Law abiding concealed or opern carrying citizens are not the ones shooting people out here. In fact, you should actually feel safer when you see that IMO. That means the area that you are in isn't a gun free zone (which is somewhere near 98% of where mass shootings occur, because these sickos/cowards look for the path of least resistance).>Understand the average iq is one hundred...so potentially half of people are under that number and they could be holding a lethal weapon on their belt or in their handbag and can be prone to emotional instability.Fair point. I guess I just don't look at people with a lower IQ as more likely to be evil. It's just anecdotal evidence, but some of the most emotionally unstable and evil people I know, are borderline geniuses. You might be right tho. I never looked into the effect that below average IQ has on gun violence.I do know that there is definitely a correlation between high population + low income areas, and crime tho. Speaking of, I saw a study the other day that showed 68% of gun related deaths in this country, comes from only 5% of our counties. It is sorta frustrating to me that people think the answer to that problem, is to not focus massive efforts towards fixing those areas, and instead just blame the inanimate object. That solves nothing IMO and doesn't get to the root of the problem.>I'm sorry if I'm being mean.Nah, you're good. These conversations usually get way more heated than this. By now I'm usual told that I supposedly don't care if kids die, and that the person I am debating with hopes that I am shot in the next mass shooting.>The presentation of you guys in pretty much every film I've ever seen has half of not more citizens wielding.There is definitely a different culture in my country. It actually severely damages and warps people's opinions on guns IMO. Because of it, some people think that suppressors actually make the sound that they do in the movies, and that all assault rifles are fully automatic. And then these people will advocate for stripping certain freedoms, based off of fallacies. I definitely don't think the answer to that is to ban or blame that type of entertainment, just think we have to combat and counter it with education.>Anyway my point is my belief of your country being full of gun toting crazies is heavily reinforced by the media so sorry bout thatAll good and that's totally understandable.

bel_esprit_,"> Yeah, because they wanted our money.Wrong. First, the monetary contribution wasn't even a requirement, it was a suggestion that we assist *voluntarily,* along with other wealthy developed nations. Bc we are ~~the top contributor~~ **the top contributor of all time** to ghg emissions, *which has directly resulted in climate change,* we are *expected* to take responsibility for our actions and hold ourselves accountable, by trying to make up for it on a global level. It's common decency, at the very least.These poor, underdeveloped nations in Africa and Asia haven't contributed *anything* to climate change. But guess what? They soon will. Many of these countries are on the brink of their own industrial revolutions, just like we had back in the 1800s- you know, the official kick-off to man made global warming as we know it?! Their economies and middle classes are growing, just like ours did in the last one-and-a-half-centuries. What do you think that means? The people in those countries will soon be entering middle class status- they'll be getting cars, having electricity, riding airplanes, all kinds of things they've never done before that we do every day- they'll be living our *dream.* And there's *billions* of them. We can't stop them for wanting the same comforts that we enjoy- that would be hypocritical. And we can't stop their economies from growing and them from enjoying the benefits of that. That's anti-capitalist. There's literally nothing we can do to stop their progress. What *we can do* is help financially provide environmentally sustainable infrastructure for when these countries do make the switch to middle class societies. We can teach them to learn from our mistakes- the mistakes we made in screwing up the environment so they aren't bound to repeat them. **We have a moral obligation to help them with environmentally sustainable solutions,** so they don't revert to cheap coal and oil, launching us full speed to climate change destruction.Is it the most ideal situation? Of course we never want to just shell out money to other countries haphazardly- who does? But there would have been major benefits if we had agreed.What Trump sorely missed is that The Paris Agreement would have cemented us in an *excellent* geopolitical position in 3 ways:1. Puts us at the forefront of all the new, cutting edge technology to appease climate change. Green light Go. This means jobs, an entire new industry centered around our research, being the global leader, and ultimately increased health and prosperity for Americans. Regardless of what the coal and oil industry want you to believe, renewable energy *is* the future and the whole world is on board with that (see Paris Agreement). China is super stoked about it and they're gladly taking over what was supposed to be *our* #1 global leadership position. 2. If we are funding the sustainable infrastructure in select developing countries, then we literally have inherent control and say over how/where to implement it- putting that sweet geopolitical power right into our hands, without having to shed even a drop of blood. There's not a better way to low key gain control of desired regions if that's what we so wish. 3. Even though we didn't want to shell out the extra money, it will brand us again as the “good guys.” Our American image has been tarnished in recent history and we are no longer admired by the world as a shining beacon of light, hope, and goodwill. Assisting other countries in sustainable development for the betterment of the whole world is a *noble-as-fuck* cause, and we would have been cherished for that for a long time to come. Instead we forfeited our model of excellence to be like everyone else. Lame. > We are still on track to meet the goals without us having to fork over money to other countries. Yea, *we* may be on track now bc of our light pivot toward a more renewable model (though I doubt it bc Trump and the GOP slash environmental initiatives every day in favor of their oil and land development cronies' greed), OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES who are approaching their industrial revolutions **are not on track.** Which is the whole point that's been made above and by anyone with a conscious who sees through Trump's charade.",0.001992373,2.159995e-06,0.0014669151,5.9092406e-05,0.0004382114,8.208612e-05

Also, I have zero problem with demanding equal respect from our ""allies"" and expecting us to treat them as they treat us. For example, the tariff on steel. China taxes our car imports 25%. Why shouldn't we tax them back? If they don't like it, they can lower their import duties on us and we'll do likewise. But we can't go around getting hosed at 25% on many of our exports and only taxing imports 3-5%. I would like to say that although we seem to disagree one a number of issues, I really appreciate the attempt at a reasonable, rational discussion here.

I haven't seen a single credible poll that points towards him being very popular at all. Voter turnout in america is, without trying to be rude, pretty pathetic. For a country that prides itself on ”freedom and democracy”, yall sure don't exercise it very much. Trump won by accident, and by corruption and an obviously flawed election system. Do you honestly think that Trump is the most qualified and ample person for the role of President? Regardless of who he was running against. The American system as a whole is the problem, not necessarily Trump or the GOP, or the Dems, as I see it. It is deeply flawed and completely owned by those who already have money and power. I think that Trump (with the help of a lot of external powers) simply used those flaws in order to aquire power, and to put themselves in a better position financially (this being proven by the multiple leaks of Trump admin people, including Trump himself, using their positions in order to trade with, for example, Russia and the middle east).

The tariffs won't have any effect on Russia as they don't sell steel or aluminum to us. And frankly tariffs are paid by the receiver.

Why not put tariffs on machinery if we wanted to hit China where it hurts? I don't think the tariffs and the meeting has anything to do with each other.

Toolset_overreacting,"Not necessarily. In August of 2015, after NK emplaced box mines on a SK patrol route and things were looking pretty hot and escalated to the point of an artillery exchange, China stepped in and sent a very subtle message. China moved a few thousand troops and a mechanized Force that looked specifically designed to destroy the NK border guard. This was a big deal because China didn't mobilize their Air Force or Navy. The message was “Look, SK, the only way we'll get to you is if we storm through North Korea and our forces meet in the center. We aren't preparing a force that is capable of direct action against you.”China's only interest in NK is keeping a buffer state between a very large concentration of US forces and themselves and maintaining what the current status quo is. China has stated that they would only become involved if SK and US forces start the war. If China did join in a war that the North started, the US would invoke article 5 of NATO so fucking fast that our heads would spin. There goes a good 70% of China's production and trade. The US would probably nullify all debts to China as well. And we owe them a lot.

USA hesitates to start a total war due to the size of china and blames mostly north korea for the death of the president. South Korea attacks North Korea with the help of the US and sees major success until they reached the newly sent chinese army before reacing the capital of NK. China drives South Korea back and China offers North Korea to South Korea under the condition to form an economical union with china and demilitarize North Korea and send US soldiers out of Korean lands. Korea agrees and unites with economic help of china to easen the trouble of the north korean people. Korea becomes gradually more and more dependant on china.

LurkerInSpace,"> SK doesn't really have the resources to deal with essentially pulling a failed post feudal state after the war into the modern age.I don't think South Korea really needs to throw enormous amounts of resources at North Korea to get it on the right track:**1)** South Korea is a very attractive country to invest in; under RoK control the North would be as business friendly but with much lower labour costs - it would be a pretty attractive place for foreign investors, and easy to get rapid economic growth.**2)** The RoK would need to manage the movement of North Koreans for a while, since a lot of them moving could put pressure on the South's public services, but providing public services in the North itself isn't that expensive - labour costs are extremely low compared to the South. That said, anything which hands out commodities like food would not benefit as much from these low costs.**3)** The biggest expense would probably be repairing and upgrading all of the North's transport infrastructure, but the South's transportation would probably only need to increase by about 20% to manage that - again due to the very low costs of North Korean labour.> enough powerful people with control over their power bases and stake in the status quo that a post decapitation war is not going to be neatly as simple as a 'liberation' war would seem.Maybe not, but East Germany had a similar number of powerful people with a stake in the regime, but it was still swept away. One could also say the same about the Confederate States during the American civil war. The solution is to integrate those influential members of the North Korean state who can be integrated, and purge the rest (which dictatorships do anyway). Most of the state's workers are there because working for the government is the only way to have a good standard of living after all.In short, I think fixing North Korea would be difficult, but China has fixed itself (economically anyway) without needing to be joined to much larger and wealthier nation.",0.00010082335,3.824822e-09,0.000204035,2.65221e-07,1.5361738e-05,9.3505025e-07

This is a control mechanism as much as any real belief by the elite, but their actions seem to show that on some level they believe their own propaganda, and the Nukes are there to counter that threat; imaginary as it may be.

And so NK has settled into a routine where it makes overtures such as this one, in exchange for food and other such aid, then goes back on their word. It's almost expected, but the real danger of the Nukes and war is a powerful bargaining chip. Lastly The Kims position in power is dangerous, he has survived several attempts on his life so far, and has had to purge many rival. And the very real fear is that he may lash out and start a war if only to rally the people around him.

EavesthePayne,NK has been trying to have a meeting with the US President for 40+ years. The prerequisite for any such meeting has always been for NK to de-nuclearize. This meeting will only serve to legitimize NKs nuclear program (not to mention scores of human rights abuses).Meeting with Kim without the promise of any sort of concessions from NK is not a strong move. Maybe as a gesture to initiate dialogue you send an ambassador or the Secretary of State but you don't start off with the POTUS.Before anybody starts in with the claim that 'NK is going to suspend nuclear testing until the meeting'.It is highly likely that they were not ready to test anything new in the upcoming months.Not doing something you weren't going to do anyway is not a concession.,0.000866205,1.1812291e-07,0.0018911833,3.5214139e-06,0.00018176767,1.1540741e-05

Need_More_Gary_Busey,">This is fucking huge, more than you can imagine.Look, I think the prospects of talks is always somewhat encouraging, and that it is usually much better for potential adversaries to talk then not to talk, but you are getting way, way ahead of yourself. The North Koreans have stated a number of times in the past that they would be prepared to de-nuclearize in exchanged for regime security, and that they have nuclear weapons only as a way of maintaining nuclear assurance. North Korea has also sought on numerous occasions, direct bilateral talks with the US, but this has been rejected based on US policy of refusing bilateral talks until certain steps have been undertaken by North Korea. US policy for quite some time after the break-down of the Agreed Framework, was that they would only only engage in six party talks, which include other actors in the region. Guess what, during these six nations talks, North Korea also agreed to denuclearize when the Bush Administration was in power.>And now they are giving up such a top principle for nothing. They have given absolutely nothing away, they have only given words, and very similar words to what they have given a number of times before. The 1994 Agreed Framework was a very significant agreement made during the Clinton Presidency, whereby North Korea would receive aid and energy assistance if they did not produce work towards producing Nuclear Weapons. They did not fulfil their side of the agreement and they didn't fulfil their agreement from the six nations talks. Trump and Kim don't even have an agreement, they haven't even met yet.>This means some real serious shit happened to them, at the backstage. You are drawing conclusions based on what has only amounted to words and a seemingly new dawn for improved relations between North Korean and its adversaries real or perceived. There have been many other false dawns when it comes to North Korea's behaviour and posture. Having said that, there are probably domestic and backstage issues that are influencing this new posture of seemingly reaching out, as there have been influencing much of the different posturing to foreign powers and the international community that North Korea has engaged in at different times.>Maybe this is their usual dice-with-death bluffing but I don't think North Korea is stupid enough to choose the life-risking bluffing this time because it will cost their lives if it turns out to be a complete lie. I think North Korea is sincerely desperate to beg for life, and this didn't happen before, and we don't know the reason.You should have stopped at ""bluffing"". Why would this time be different in that them lying would result in them ""losing their lives""? How have you come to this conclusion? Based on what?As far as ""begging for life"", this is just hyperbole. NK are putting forward the possibility that they will be willing to negotiate. They are not begging for their lives. The regime knows that in a full-scale conflict with the United States, that they would mostly be obliterated, but they could cause some massive devastation to hundreds and thousands, if not millions of people, in exchange. They know they have chips on the table, and they know that others know that they have chips on the table.It is good to optimism but we haven't even got to the point of an official agreement for denuclearize that has been reached on occasions before, only for the DPRK to breach it. All we have is statements of intent from The DPRK, and we don't know why they are adopting this stance now.

And, he seems to frequently disregard the advice of those that do. This tends to pull me towards the hope that he only lasts one term. Not that i hope he fails, just that I would rather have someone more level-headed in control of the most powerful country this world has ever seen. Our world has been relatively stable since WWII, but the edge we're balancing on can be easily dislodged and chaos follow.

People on the far left screaming racism for everything, everyone is a victim, and claiming conservatives just don't understand, only fuels hatred for them from the right. Even people who I know that are moderates are being turned off by The victim mentality that seems to permeate those on the left. The far right also disgusts these people though, so it's not like they're swinging in the opposite direction, they just see the ridiculousness all around. The rise in nationalism on the far right, involving rhetoric aimed at racial purity, echoes the evil of Nazi Germany (not trying to bring Nazis into this, but when they chant ""Jews won't replace us"" and blame everything on ""globalists"", it reminds me of every historical account I've read from Germany in the 1930s. Hard to ignore). Unless we suddenly all forget the horrors of WWII, people will always fight to the bitter end against this thought process, but none the less, the ideology is gaining ground.Unfortunately, modern social media helps fuel this divide. Yes, Russia is involved (I tend to side with the intelligence agencies of us and our allies, over the claims of anyone from a particular political party), and they're playing both sides. They want us in the west to be divided. It makes us weaker. The more we become divided, the more likely we can't reach a solution to a major issue, and the ultimate outcome could very well be war, whether with another nation or ourselves.We need to get back to being able to discuss and debate on an intelligent level. Understand the other side, and work with them to find what can be agreed upon, and not yell fake news at stuff we don't like.

Which felt like a huge betrayal to some of the French armed forces (who felt like the losses they suffered up until there were for nothing), and also the colonists living in Algeria (who were in a very bad position because with independence they'd either get killed or have to flee to the mainland with nothing, and a lot of them were farm or store owners).So disgruntled soldiers formed a ""secret army"" (they actually called it the ""organization of the secret army"", OAS in French) and they tried to kill De Gaulle at least twice. Since they were professional soldiers they didn't fuck around and had access to heavy equipment (and knew how to use it). They tried once with a bomb, another time they just fired at his car with automatic weapons. Both times he barely made it (and there was luck involved at least once because the bomb malfunctioned).He's recognized as a great statesman in France (for good reason he did do awesome things) but he was also good at doing things that were convenient. And kind of an asshole at times.And it's an issue where whichever stance he'd take would bring a lot of problems his way. The OAS guys were pissed off. But on the other side the algerians (and some of their supporters on the mainland) were also pretty good at terrorism and assassinations (at the time lots of them were WW2 veterans).",0.11700632,3.479408e-05,0.12966505,0.0003144011,0.024486471,0.000901251

justletmewrite,"I don't like this meeting. And I'll give you several reasons why:1. North Korea has a history of gaslighting everyone by claiming it will denuclearize and then not going forward. Their claim can only be taken seriously when they allow investigators back into the country as proof they want to denuclearize. 2. By taking Un at his word and taking his promise seriously, you legitimize him as a ruler. The willingness of an American president to meet with and legitimize a man who publicly assassinated his half brother and who runs concentration camps across his country makes the US look stupid and is akin meeting with Hitler after we knew what he was doing to the Jews. That's insane. 3. Whatever agreement is made, however illegitimate because the NK won't be serious about it, Trump is likely to use it to praise both himself and a dictator whose raw power he's been clear he admires. That's bad for everybody. 4. Why are you so sure that two men with fragile egos won't end up starting WWIII over this meeting? Why assume only the best can come from this?

Under these final rules, we will identify, on a prospective basis, individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (Act) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under title XVI of the Act and who also meet certain other criteria, including an award of benefits based on a finding that the individual's mental impairment meets or medically equals the requirements of section 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments (Listings) and receipt of benefits through a representative payee. We will provide pertinent information about these individuals to the Attorney General on not less than a quarterly basis. As required by the NIAA, at the commencement of the adjudication process we will also notify individuals, both orally and in writing, of their possible Federal prohibition on possessing or receiving firearms, the consequences of such prohibition, the criminal penalties for violating the Gun Control Act, and the availability of relief from the prohibition on the receipt or possession of firearms imposed by Federal law. Finally, we also establish a program that permits individuals to request relief from the Federal firearms prohibitions based on our adjudication.

permatway,"Color me skeptical. I'm just a random idiot on the internet but it just doesn't make any sense to me that NK will trade its actual nuclear capabilities for theoretical regime assurance. There was an incident I believe in 2007 or so during the final phases of the six-party talks where the US delegates essentially promised the same thing, a peace treaty and economic aid and a written declaration that would have been signed by POTUS that the US will not attack NK in exchange for verifiable denuclearization. NK delegates (and KJI, KJU's dad) were mulling over the offer for several days, and during back-door talks with 'its side' (Russia and China) eventually told them they would reject the offer. Apparently, the Russian delegates were flabbergasted, their jaws dropped to the floor, they couldn't believe what they were hearing. They half explained half yelled at the NK delegates that such an agreement was more than ~~what the USSR wanted during decades of the cold war~~ what they considered reasonable and a signed declaration to not attack was more than what the USSR wanted during the cold war. Nothing has changed imo for what is essentially the same deal to be more attractive to the NK regime. In fact from the NK perspective it seems worse - they now have their weapons. It would be great for all parties involved if I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong, but it seems to me this whole diplomatic offensive is just a setup to drive a wedge between SK and USA. Most likely NK will start by asking for a sweetener to attend the meeting, a loosening of sanctions or something, as an indicator of good faith. The SK side will almost certainly agree (left wing in charge, SK left wing are USA-skeptics, optimistic on NK and peaceful reunification), the US side will almost certainly disagree (right wing in charge, idealogically committed to the idea that sanctions are a positive force for change). Proposed talks will collapse on this point, SK and USA will blame the other, driving a wedge, which is what NK really wants.I hope I'm wrong though...",0.00012744927,6.5386487e-09,0.0002457012,4.1059894e-07,2.253304e-05,1.2093823e-06

Maybe sanctions with, again maybe, help from China are in fact being effective. I find the announcement of tariffs aimed at China to be interesting regarding the timing of this (Perhaps a warning from Trump to China, as NK would have serious problems without Beijing's support). Additionally, we just landed a hell of a blow on Russia in Syria and the Russians would certainly be considered a superior military as compared to NK. I would also mention that Trump, unlike his predecessors appears to be following through on campaign promises and has a very different style/approach to diplomacy than they did. Also, remember that the NK test launch site collapsed and that is all the more news we got from it.I don't know that we are, but I imagine that our NSA/CIA does their best to infiltrate their cyber systems and perhaps they have and screwed them up.So again, I am skeptical, but maybe the writing is on the wall and Rocket man sees it.",0.023148203,1.3336219e-06,0.0074363328,3.694768e-05,0.0032231598,0.00017592295

One these exercises was that US agreeded to send a token amount of oil by ship to NK once a month. At the time Clinton was President but both houses of Congress were controlled by the Republicans. The Pentagon was still shrinking due to end of the Cold War and was affraid that is peace occured in Korea that it might lead to base closing inside South Korea. The State Department didn't like peaceful Korea peninsula because they would lose leverage against China and Russia. So they spun the agreement as Clinton acting weak and appeasement. Generals and admirals were paraded in to Congressional committees to trash talk the agreement and make threats against North Korea. Congress also passed a series of laws that was tailored in such a way as to sabotage the agreement reached with North Korea.
