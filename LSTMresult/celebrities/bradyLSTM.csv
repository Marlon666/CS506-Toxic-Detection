Hesi_Pull-up_Timbo,"TL;DR: Sixers fan knows Jerry Jones will never hire a good coach, still loves Romo dearly1. I'm a Philly native who now goes to the University of Oklahoma, so my appreciation for my home town has drastically increased2. I've become a huge Sixers fan3. After re-discovering this year that Jason Garrett is a weak willed, limp-dicked purse dog for Jerry Jones who did NOT deserve coach of the year in 2016, I realized that after Jimmy Johnson, Jones will never hire a strong coach who will take control of the team. Jones will also never sell the team, because it's the most valuable sports franchise on the planet. So if those two are true, I'll have to wait out Jerry Jones' death to have a chance to see the cowboys make a deep playoff run without the miracle player health and performance that lead to our 2014 and 2016 runs. Yeah I'd want to see the Boys do well, but I don't want Jerry Jones kissing the trophy as if his ownership hadn't hindered the success of the team for the past 20 years.In the end, I will always root for Dak and Zeke and Dez and Sean Lee. I'll ESPECIALLY always root for Witten and claim Romo as my favorite player ever, because I grew up watching those two take it to the NFCE (in the words of Phife Dawg [RIP] ""I tell ya that's vision; like Tony Romo when he's hittin' Witten"").Maybe I won't actually give it up.

We drove there, and we all decided we'd go out to dinner together. Tom being who he was, he usually couldn't come to a team event like that. We might be at Capital Grille and he is sneaking in the back door and then people realize he's there and he has to leave. But this was impromptu at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Rochester. The whole team is there. And it turns into a beer-chugging contest. You have linemen, Julian Edelman, they all think they are going to win. Then someone says, 'I heard Tom is really great at chugging a beer.' We don't usually get to experience him like this, but we finally coax him into doing it. He does it, and let me tell you, you couldn't have poured out the beer faster into a glass. It was unbelievable. And he slams the mug on the table and puts both fists in the air. He walks away with a look on his face that said, 'You really thought you were going to beat me on this?'

moldy_cake,"I could see a sequel to American Psycho (not counting the sequel that already exists) where the main character has made it into the national spot light as a highly successful star quarterback, being touted as the greatest player of all time. He has a very rigid workout routine each morning. He spends time in his office listening to his music, not taking calls, pretending to be talking to others who are very important. All the while, a dark, sinister side is brewing. Sure, he threw for 372 yards on Sunday at home, and the city is going nuts over the fantastic victory against a hated rival. Some little mini-riots are going on, nothing too intense, but just enough to draw all police attention elsewhere. And that's when he strikes. He's just cruising around a shadier side of town. No one would ever mess with him, and anyone who saw him wouldn't believe it's really him, anyway. He pulls off next to a bank, parks and locks his car as he begins a stroll through the alleyways. He takes the long way around. He knows these streets well, having grown up only a few blocks from here. He had time to learn every little nook and cranny. Ah, a homeless man. Just what he was waiting for. So her does a little murder, and back into his car he goes. It starts off as a few homeless men dying in the streets, then maybe a prostitute winds up missing, they never find her. All the while this star QB has all of these media appearances, major football games, excessive training sessions. Everyone in the locker room knows that he's always working, and so they know when he has his off time to not bother him. His off time only comes but 4 or 5 times during the regular season. It's during these times that he can be himself. Anyways, I think Tom Brady is a serial killer.",0.005702951,5.967078e-06,0.0014756984,2.805722e-05,0.0005603146,4.2958378e-05

I don't get the mentality, I was always able to be friends with Lakers and Yankees fans at the height of those rivalries with my teams, and I thought their great players were awesome. (I was a weirdo Celtics fan who loved both Bird and Magic.)The most fascinating side-effect of the Patriots dynasty, after about 3 decades of fandom where my teams didn't win all that much, is how people are suddenly dicks to you for no other reason than the team you root for.
