What is to stop them from releasing the information once you pay them?Not much, which is why you shouldn't really think of blackmail as a one time thing.

Clearly, they don't want the information out there, so if they paid you at all, they would probably be willing to pay you again later.

Schmuckey,My high school did the same thing but with “mmm bop” by Hanson for like 2 weeks until they got a certain amount of money. This was back in 2009. They stopped when someone wrote an anonymous note stating if they heard the song one more time that they would commit suicide. Edit: I went to Desert Vista in Arizona. It seems a large amount of schools across the county conspired in these extortion tactics. Probably something that was on MySpace.

jooes,"I helped with fundraisers all the time when I was in high school.We did it for things like school dances and the various events that we ran. School dances were pretty expensive and would easily cost a few hundred dollars once you factor in the cost of the DJ and rent-a-cops and stuff. We'd often make money off the dances (so they were like their own fundraiser), but still, that initial money has to come from somewhere. And then that money would go on to funding the other events that we had throughout the year. So, things like Halloween days or Christmas events or whatever. These things cost money, and it's something the kids want (at least so they can get out of class for the day) but it's not something the school itself is willing to pay for.Prom/Graduation was a big thing too. Those things are pretty expensive. I went to a super small high school, and that thing was still probably a couple thousand dollars to run....We occasionally fundraised for a specific cause as well. Like raising money so certain kids would shave their heads, and then giving the money to some cancer charity. Or at one point, we bought a goat for an African village or some shit. I personally thought that one was pretty dumb, but these two girls were super into it and wouldn't stop going on and on about it so that happened. That was like $400 too, it was ridiculous...Most of the more expensive classes ran their own fundraisers as well. Things like shop, music, even gym class, all to try to get new equipment.... Or I know our English/History classes would raise money to send kids to museums or plays and things like that.At the end of the day, you don't *have* to donate money, but schools can't really afford to pay for a lot of the fun things kids want to do, so fundraisers seem fine to me.... unless you're raising money for a goat, then that's just stupid.

TinyLittleFlame,$400 is pretty expensive for a goat (my father in law is in the giat business). I suppose they don't buy the goat from the african country.

Wilthywonka,"A combination of several factors:-~~the fact that a lot of teachers teach as a last-resort career.~~ Ok so I'm a little bit off on this one. In the state I grew up in (WA) You need to have a BA and gone through a teacher's training program. Not necessarily last resort, but can easily become one for a struggling college graduate as your BA does not need to be specific to teaching. At least for public schools.-lack of funding/ broken system; teachers lower their standards so students get A's and therefore get from the system more federal funding to compensate for their lack of funding, to play the system that was trying to heighten standards. This lowering of standards allows crappy teachers to remain teachers.-teachers union; also allows shitty teachers to remain teachers. A lot of the time, once past their probation period (which is like 1-4 years in most cases) teachers can sit on their ass or be the most toxic people in the world and not get fired as long as they ascend to mediocrity during teacher observations (which aspire to be like random inspections but the execution and result is laughable)-over-prioritization of sports; some teachers are just there to be a coach rather than to actually cause students to learn (some exceptions of course, I've had good teachers that also coached). And I'd say a significant portion of the time these 'teachers' get promoted to principal. -bureaucracy.Source: went through school with a healthy amount of cynicism and observation.Of course this just paints the negative aspects. On the flip side, a significant portion of teachers teach because they wanted to teach in the first place and are good at it.

Bobthemime,"I went to a Welsh Language school.. they were even stricter in the classroom. Asking a question on anything but perfect Welsh would get you a detention.. though that was abused so often that only the strictest teachers upheld it.It got really bad when we got a substitute teacher in (well more like a semi-perm teacher, as our notmal teacher was on maternity leave) and she was teaching English. We had to read English poems in welsh despite it being practice for our English Oral exam.

Needless to say our class had near a month of detentions thanks to that teacher.Detentions in our school, especially at lunchtime was 80% of the alotted time. So school dinners, which we werent allowed to bring our own unless with written permission for allergies, or go out of campus until later years, meant that we got the burnt crap dinner that nobody else wanted.Good luck getting anything to eat or drink during break.

Xerox748,"This was my school! Technically not Chicago, it's Evanston, the first suburb north of Chicago.The headline here is very misleading. It wasn't the administration's idea. This was organized by students and the money was raised for a non profit that gave free music classes and provided a free recording studio time to people in the community. Playing music between classes was already really common, and this was sort of a “Hey, we know you hate this song too, help us provide resources for people who otherwise couldn't afford it, to make better music” Evanston has always been very supportive of the arts and especially music, is no exception.Also, to really put this in context, you need to understand the demographics of the school. The population of the entire school, students and staff, was over 5000 people. And it was a fairly well off community. Not super rich, but fairly well off. Most of my friends all got cars for their 16th birthdays, or graduation. I graduated with a kid who was **Personally** worth over $40 Million (Dad died in a skiing accident).

Colley619,Lmao guy you guys are overreacting. They did this at my school too once. Playing music over the intercom was definitely not torturing anybody.

HappyMeatbag,"Ethically questionable, but the fact that it was two seniors who suggested it makes it seem more like a prank for a good cause than the administration being greedy and mean. After all, as students, the seniors were volunteering to be tortured along with their classmates. I'm also relieved to see that the article specifies it was Evanston Township High School. For those of you who don't know, Evanston Township IL is a pretty affluent area.
