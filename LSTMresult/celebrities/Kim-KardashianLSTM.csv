Perturbed_Spartan,"I definitely wouldn't call War of the Worlds an ""action"" movie. Sure things blow up but the tone of the movie is much closer to horror. But it's not jump scare horror. Its a pervasive and consistent fear of something much more powerful than us finally come to sweep humanity aside. The movie nails this. Everything about the tripods is unsettling. The way they move, how they just make people disappear with no effort, and that fucking foghorn. A sound that simultaneously and clearly communicates two things: **Alien** and **Power**. In an action movie that first scene with the tripod would be used to set the stakes. To establish a threat for the hero's to over come and next scene they leap into action. But in War of the Worlds that scene IS the movie. We spend the rest of the film running *away* from that not towards it.Whereas a movie like Independence Day which is similar in plot (Aliens invade, aliens kill humans, aliens catch cold, humans kill aliens) focuses on characters who present a broad view of what's happening world wide (or at least America wide), Tom Cruise's character is in the dark for practically the entire movie. He doesn't know what's happening out there. If we're winning or losing. All he knows is what he sees which is a world inexorably being overtaken by an unknown other. This radically changes the tone and feeling of the film.I challenge you to name me another ""generic alien invasion movie"" that captures an ounce of War of the Worlds tension and dread.",8.0042955e-06,1.9728613e-12,2.9799987e-05,2.9385573e-08,1.1500517e-07,1.272388e-09

FrenchCuirassier,"My feeling is that there is a shady PR company out there pretending like so many people saw her sex tape back in the day and then she sued and the tabloids kept talking about it.But the reality is, no one saw her sex tape at the time. It is all a big shady PR campaign and everyone was looking at other types of porn on the internet because no one even knew Kim at the time. It's all fake. The idea that people saw her sex tape when it was released, even that was fake. No one gave a shit, they manufactured the rumors that attempted to gossip about how people saw her sex tape and then people finally saw her sex tape as a result of rumors of people seeing her sex tape. People searched the sex tape, because they thought other people were watching the sex tape. They were duped.
