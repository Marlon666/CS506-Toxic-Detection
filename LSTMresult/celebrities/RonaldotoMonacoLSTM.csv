SeanTayla21,"Why?If Monaco are willing to overpay, just to make him the biggest transfer fee and the biggest wages in world football...why would that be 'silly'?I'm not saying this is guaranteed to happen. But I am saying that just last night...Sid Lowe was on TV, pointedly making the remark that...everyone is caught up in this Bale-Must-Go theme, when, in reality...there's every bit as much of a chance of it being Ronaldo who is the 1 of the Big 3 to leave...thus freeing up the space for Mbappe. His argument for saying that was based on things he had heard from some in the Spanish press apparently. That, plus the logical argument that...if Zidane is trying to make the team younger, and fitter...then Bale is the one he wants to keep. And it's Cristiano Ronaldo that is the most expendable...And now this post/theory/story shows up today?...We'll see what happens but, it just doesn't seem all that far-fetched at the moment, all things considered.(""Where there's *smoke*...there may be *fire*."")",0.0008534847293049097,4.2706509439938145e-09,0.00034373754169791937,2.3331527643222216e-07,0.00011853440810227767,5.78416393182124e-06

FiskoSC,"Many people will find this stupid, it's really not. I'm a long time Monaco fan, I learned during the years lot of stuff about Rybolovlev and the russian side of his business. This guy goes really to details about some stuff. When you talk about Monaco team you always talk about Rybolovlev and Vasiliev, people always miss a big piece of the puzzle : Alexey Fedorichev, this discreet guy own Fedcom (ou Fedcominvest), he's a big fan of AS Monaco and wanted to buy the club before Rybolovlev did it, the prince of Monaco said no, if you want to know why make some research about this company, there is some shady sponsors in football but forget everything you know about them, Fedcom is the next level and you won't find any serious journalist research about this company, no one really want to stick their nose in this for good reasons. This guy bringing Fedorichev in the table is the reason on why he got my attention. Rybolovlev (our president) always tried to bring Ronaldo to Monaco, he's a big fan of the player and it's clearly a bilionaire fantasy, yes Monaco is a toy for him, PSG is a toy for the qatar sheik so is Chelsea and City. Those people build toilets in pure gold to shit on them so heh ... why not ... He never succeded / tried very much before of the FFP. Is this guy serious ? I don't know, the fact he posted on this forum (We call it ""Le Vizu"" and it's mostly used by old Monaco fans) and the fact the admin on this forum checked his IP and it was a positive match straight to Russia add even more mystery to this. It's really not 100% stupid, either it's (partialy) true or we are dealing with a genius of fakes, like the Al Pacino of the internet trolls. I'm not biased at all, the last thing I want is Ronaldo coming here (I like our projet like it is right now and making this type of investment is like doing a coinflip with the future of our club) especialy when it imply selling 3 of our best and promising players.",0.040486373007297516,8.539061724377461e-08,0.0073496075347065926,5.037109076511115e-06,0.003955722786486149,5.963404328213073e-05

Flikker,"People act like it is out of this world. I don't see it happening at all, but I would still like to offer some support to your theory:Ronaldo is becoming a different, lesser player. He's 32 and stated he wanted to play 5 more years in 2015. Last season proved he will always be able to score 30+ goals a season, but he lost part of his speed, stamina and his drive. He's not as influential to the teamplay, not as he was, not as the top 5 players in this world are now. Second, to add to his tax rage, a supposed motivation to leave: he always FIRMLY stated he saw the end of his career at Madrid. The first ever contradicting statement was confirmed by teammates and happened 2 months ago. That doesn't mean he wants to go, but it does mean he is not as sure to end his carreer at Real as he was.Thirdly, Mbappe money is real. Offers by City and Madrid have been confirmed and would make it FFP possible.Fourth, Ronaldo has spoken often about his business ventures after his career. (i.e. AFP 2015: ""Many football players end their careers not knowing what to do. For me it's clear - I want to take care of my brands.""). Finnally, AS Monaco will seriously compete in the CL and the increasingly more interesting but less intensive Ligue 1. It's a serious top team that quality wise is just one tier below Madrid. This transfer could help transition his career, while decreasing the possibility of losing face. I'm rooting for it to happen. Not even for Monaco AS, though business wise it might be a smart decision and that is how things are being run there. It would be better to keep most/all talent and build a squad for the years to come, but it seems AS is being handled as a business. Plus the first Neymar to PSG rumour was tossed out of the window exactly the same way this is.

juggernaut8,As theories go it's not that unbelievable. Rybolovlev has the money and Ronaldo has the ego to be the most expensive player of all time. A massive paycheck for the last 4-5 years would be great too. The only hitch to this theory is Ronaldo leaving Real for a weakened Monaco.

archtme,"It's a well written and compelling story but I doubt CR7 will leave RMA this summer. And here's why:1) all the rumors about him leaving exploded once his tax case became public, to divert attention and reduce damage done to his image. As the case went a bit colder the rumors kind of died out. 2) RMA are enjoying their greatest period in decades right now and CR7 is playing to be considered the GOAT. Messi still has more titlea than him, and RMA are in a great position to pick up more. RMA are also way more likely to pick up more UCL titles. CR7 currently sits at a record 4 UCL titles along with the likes of Xavi, Iniesta, Pique, Messi etc. Adding more would give him more of a GOAT argument vs Messi.3) I truly believe RMA would have considered selling him this summer if it wasn't for his goal haul at the tail end of the UCL. People who watched RMA in the last few years know that CR7 has declined but he kept posting good numbers. For 80 % of the 16/17 season he was equally invisible during the games but for the first time he also weren't scoring as much. He had like 2 or 3 goals up until the UCL quarter final and wasn't producing that many goals in the League either.But vs Bayern and onwards he had a crazy scoring spree which showed he can still be decisive. If it wasn't for that I think the ruthless Perez (who nowadays seem to finally have gotten the great team he always wanted to build) would have forced him out.4) I think CR7 intends to play at the very top for as long as possible to try to outlast Messi. This rivalry motivates him and Messi is posting better goal ratios and has more titles. Messi will retake various records from CR7 if CR7 quits before he does, So to beat him CR7 needs to play for as long as Messi does or beyond Messis career. CR7 is an incredible professional, second to no athlete in the world so he can probably play for many more years. Off the pitch he seems to leave almost everything out because he knows he's hitting the end of his career and once that's done he can do all that other stuff.If your goal is to be considered the best It is prefarable to play at the very top in a club like RMA as opposed to a top15 club like Monaco. The question is whether he can stay relevant and as I mentioned above, he did have a scare in 16/17. Messi's style of playing would allow him to play and stay at the top for many more years but he has never given the impression of someone who wants to play into his 40's. Nor is he driven by the rivalry and will likely just quit/go to Newell's when he feels like it. Many believe that might happen when he's 34 or 35. Chances are CR7 will try to hang on to RMA as long as Messi is still in Barca.5) Thank you for the downvotes.",0.0006154977018013597,1.6638718847161726e-08,0.0006851464859209955,4.127020076793997e-07,0.00017637258861213923,9.491101081948727e-06
