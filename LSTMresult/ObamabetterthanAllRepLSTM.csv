That is a fair enough opinion but may I ask what you suggest we throw that money at? Give me some ideas because since the 1970s our education spending has drastically raised while test scores have not. [Here is a graph showing the increases](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_otfwl2zc6Qc/SqgYwPKlGCI/AAAAAAAALSA/XJI3BUM5Mn8/s400/cato.jpg) It certainly seems to me that throwing more and more money at education hasn't done much to help, but if you think it will please supply actual solutions rather then just bash another party. Furthermore, the last Republican president (the party you say cuts spending to education) increased student financial aid by 20$ billion.

That's VERY different from barraging 12 year olds with tests.Tests NEED to be given, of course, but standardized tests are disastrous in elementary/middle schools especially. Let kids just LEARN in those grades. Teachers can give tests for their subjects (this would require admins to release some power).

Articles are deadly dull and outdated (how this happens on tests that have had millions spent on them is beyond me), questions have more than one viable answer.

teacherdrama,"I maintain two things: 1)that's very limited thinking about educational policy, and 2)we have zero control over the test. The administration (re: the school board) decides on the test and buys it from an independent company (capitalism at its best). We are stuck with whatever test we get because the district has a contract to give out the test for x amount of years. Supposedly in two years we're changing tests - to one that tests four times a year. Brilliant, no? Additionally, why do we need standards across the country?

How about giving teachers the responsibility to deal with their students' advancements?In an ideal world, teachers would have that responsibility, tests would be long forgotten, and students would learn as was appropriate to their needs.

JustAnotherJon,"Thats a relevant point as to the age of the test takers. When I went through grade school we took one standardized test at the end of the, but it didn't determine whether we passed/failed. It was just to make sure the private schools were up to par with the public ones.I'm 26 so I'm not sure if I got the rigorous testing that our current generation is receiving. Call me sick, but I've always looked forward to tests. It's a chance to compete against my peers and put my learning into action. I just don't see anyway that we can get good data without testing.Do you think that the dumbing down of our kids could possibly have more to do with the ""cool"" culture? It seems to me that often times certain segments of society just simply teach their kids not to care about education. They get it from the TV, movies, etc. I don't really understand this. In high school there were some of my friends that could most likely be stereotyped as ""rednecks"" and if the succeeded in school it was like they were betraying some strange sense of culture.

Washington has known we were on this path for a long time yet did little to nothing to stop it and just kept spending and spending. I am not blaming any single party here as they have both helped get us to this point. The only recent president I can give SOME credit to would be Clinton who at least slowed the growth of government to be less then the growth of the private market which overtime would fix many problems. While raising the debt ceiling was necessary at the time I believe it is insane that it ever had to get to that point, and that many people view it as an actual solution, rather it is just a quickly peeling band-aid. > Also, you completely ignored my comment about military spending.I apologize for not addressing your comments on military spending, but I mostly agree big cuts can be made in forms of military spending. However at this point just sending everyone home is not easy and will still take years to accomplish. Cuts can be made in minimizing our presence overseas other then Iraq and Afghanistan. We have huge military bases all over the world, many times within a few hundred miles of each other. I don't believe that is necessary and I believe we could shut down and bring home at least half of those bases which would be a nice chunk of change we would be saving. If that were to happen though we have to be carefully to make sure the money saved is going to not just be spent somewhere else as if often the case. As for blaming the credit downgrade, I don't think you can really blame on party. If you want to blame republicans for not raising the debt ceiling fast enough then you could equally blame the democrats for not getting behind the republicans proposed cuts. This is a game you could play all day in the end you'll never win. Are we really surprised that the republicans and democrats are often in political gridlock? It doesn't take someone with a degree to figure that one out.

rmmdjmdam,"Ah excellent - I did misunderstand your point of view. You're irritated that they got to the point where they needed to raise the debt ceiling, not that raising the debt ceiling itself is a bad idea - just bad that we got to that point. Okay - you and I see much more eye-to-eye than I originally thought, always a good thing to focus on.Yes - raising the debt ceiling was not a solution, it was a necessary patch that the federal government (Democrat and Republican) has done numerous times. In this instance the Democrats wanted to raise it again, while the Republicans used it as a political pawn to force discussing the deficit (not the most honorable thing, but understandable as a political move, though risky). I guess my problem with this is I don't understand why we are all of a sudden panicking about the debt - the deficit has been there for over a decade now that the last vestiges of the prosperity revenue levels and pre-Bush tax rates have passed and existed well into Clinton's first term, but all of a sudden with Obama in office, its the Republican issue in vogue, particularly given that they can't criticize the President for being weak on foreign policy.Looking at the raw numbers I do see massive [spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_public_debt) (forgive me for linking to wikipedia but their page is quite comprehensive) in the debt during the Obama administration and Bush 2 successfully doubled the debt over 8 years, giving the appearance that there is something relatively new to the extent of out of control spending that I do not understand. I take issue with the Republicans for patently refusing to raise taxes on the ""job creators"" despite not providing evidence that the lower taxes actually result in more jobs than giving that money to the middle class, or to paying down the debt! That said I can easily go after either party for not making any proposals on entitlements or the military - when our defense budget equals the next 15 combined, something seems amiss, like we're mounting a defense for an enemy that doesn't exist. We very much agree about the need for and size/cost of our military.Regarding the military; the biggest potential geopolitical controversy I can foresee is China forcibly invading Taiwan, but that's about the limit of where I can see China claiming as that territory was truly their's a few hundred years back, but mounting a war against Japan or Australia would be political suicide and would compromise their economic success that has been so crucial to their rising world standing, furthermore they don't really have a legitimate claim anywhere else (plus Taiwan is a bit of a sticky personal issue dating back to a changing dynasty if memory serves). So we don't need a huge military to defend against a Chinese invasion. The hype about Iran is just hype - Iran with nuclear weapons is a threat to Israel, not the US, because Iran for all its other faults has a stable federal government that wants more than anything else to stay in power, where giving a nuclear weapon to terrorist to bomb a US city would completely remove their ability to stay in power and even bombing the Israelis would be a massive risk because of US-Israeli relations. So basically, we don't need a huge air force or army for either of these scenarios. A strong surface fleet from the navy can still project force as necessary to help smooth situations in favor of the US, which again begs the question of the purpose of the US military, but I'm already far enough off track that I'll stop without addressing that, just to say a big navy may still be a good idea.So all that said my BIGGEST concern out of all of this is that while we need to decrease federal spending, we're still in a recession. Unemployment might actually be above 8% because the state and local governments had to balance their budgets and thus cut employment, which is where the danger of austerity comes in. Trying to balance the budget when revenues are strong is comparatively trivial - hey Clinton managed it(!), but also a lot LESS dangerous to the health of the economy that the cuts you make while we struggle to meet the critical mass when consumer spending is consistently high. I am not an economist and they seem to disagree on the correct approach, but from what I've seen in Europe austerity seems to be closely connected to high unemployment, which is very bad and borrowing now when interest rates are so low is not as expensive as borrowing during high times when the rates are higher, so running up the deficit to get people working and spending money doesn't seem like such a bad idea. The Federal Government is in a weird position that unlike a business, when things are bad, I can very reasonably see why it would NOT be beneficial to cut spending as you cut funding to things that keep people working (like the auto bailouts) and in doing so keep towns floating above water both in the region where the cars are made and in the towns where parts are supplied, which allows other small businesses like pharmacies, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurants to maintain enough business that they can keep operating. If all those towns hugely dependent on one business lose that business, everything else that was supported by that will fail as people can't afford to eat out, or buy the higher margin items at the pharmacy or grocery store, hurting the profitability and viability of those businesses, while the town has to make cuts which can limit its police force and fire departments or DPW, which coupled with higher unemployment results in higher levels of crime, further harming those businesses. People will do what they need to survive, so its best if you don't push them to that limit or give them time to try what might be crazy ideas... Look at New Orleans after Katrina...So basically, we need to get control of the deficit, but wild and drastic cuts are likely to hurt us more in the long term, while running the deficit higher for the time being to reinvest in infrastructure could help modernize the US and get people working (and spending money) that will restart the economy. That and I feel like I need to be an economist to actually make appropriate judgements here.

As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain.This is such a rudimentary element of right-wing thought that the only way you could possibly say such a thing is if you are ignorant (there's nothing wrong with that if you're willing to learn) or you yourself are the victim of a propaganda machine.If you don't realize that the idea that people on the right are racists that hate poor people is a product of a propaganda machine then I dunno, just think about it for like 1 second.

Fox News took the lead running positive stories and actively promoting their meetings. C-SPAN followed suite covering pretty much every meeting where more than three of them showed up.

TwoDeuces,"This is why we need more parties. I figure there is some truth to the OP's statement. The Koch brothers, Newt, O'Reily. None of these people are actually republican. They don't believe in conservatism; they believe in conservation of their own wealth. They don't believe in upholding the constitution; they believe in adjusting the laws to suit themselves. They don't care about anyone but themselves. We should come up with a new party name, the Gekko's. That's what they are. They're the embodiment of greed. I, for one, feel bad for truly republican voters who have no one to vote for because the politicians that pledged to speak for them have sold their souls. And so many of these voters, out of desperation, come to the defense of these people because they hope that maybe they still share some common ground, and that maybe by voting for them, this politician will speak for them. But it doesn't happen, I'm sorry, it just doesn't. This is how Boehner got elected, by playing out that ""common man"" card and pledging to get out a broom and sweep away corruption. But he's a catastrophe, too idealistic to know how to play the game, too stupid to realize that he he's too idealistic. And for the record, I'm not a democrat either. Because that party is no better.

JordanLeDoux,"It's plainly apparent that Republicans have things which they would not sell out or budge on philosophically. Among them, I believe, is the preferential treatment of Christian values, which is something that some people want in our society.Another, I think, is the ability of our military to assure the destruction of any other individual country if we had to, which there are a great number of people who view as prudent. Many people don't think too hard about it, but America as a society was deeply scarred by WW2. (Which is not to say that many other countries were not left with deeper scars.)I think in a lot of ways, the US people came out of WW2 going, ""holy shit, we've just been over here doing our thing and the whole rest of the world is batshit insane!"" For some, there was a feeling that we had been sensible and steadily improving for the past 150 years, and that the rest of the world appeared to be like overly destructive children. It's a description of the emotive response of the populace.Republicans are still mostly in this mindset. They view us as the adults, and think that the rest of the world is full of 5 years olds that will cause a mess as soon as we turn around. It's not strictly speaking a crazy position to hold, but it is a very ethnocentric one, which IMO is primarily caused by the fact that we teach very little history to people, especially history of the rest of the world.To many Republicans, no one ever taught them the series of connected events and circumstances that the rest of the world went through in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, and without that information history really does look kind of like:""Oh hey, here's America, just doing our thing and making progress...

someotherguy4112,"I promise this isn't a sock puppet, I'm a lurker who felt the need to chime in here. I will preface this by saying I'm a moderate and neither Conservative nor Liberal and if it helps anyone my favorite senator (who the republicans loathed) was Olympia Snow.Anyhow the US's Military policy isn't about WWII aftershock or some idea of us as a grown adult policing children. That is an incredibly childish point of view and the people who advice our President and Congress on military policy are not children.What happened during at after WWII was that the policy of isolationism the US had been practicing was proven to be false. That events happening on the other side of the world could have repercussions and effect the USA, those repercussions could be both negative and positive. The logical following this is that if the US wanted to have an effect on those events and attempt to coerce them to what is good for the USA.I know the instant reaction to this is shock and horror, please realize that nations have no morals nor are required to have them. Nations are composed of people and therefor what is best for those people is best for that nation. The government of any nation's first priority should always be to seek the best for the people it represents. Nations are in effect self serving entities. That's how it's been since the first gathering of walking apes decided to form a tribe. This isn't so say governments always do their job, that's a different argument altogether.The Military is a tool, nothing more nothing less. It's purpose is to create and control violence as ordered by the government. This violence may be offensive or defensive, again controlled by the government which is supposed to be representative of it's people. Ultimately the military serves the national interests. One of the way it serves a nations national interest is in projecting power, which is just another way of saying to make another nation do what you want them to do. Again *shock + horror*, yet nations are amoral and seek their best interests, hence the presence of a military.Now that we've went over that, this is why the US does what it does. It is in the US's best interest that no aggressive superpower is formed that could incite another World War. Under this policy small limited regional conflicts are acceptable if they prevent the creation of a World War. For the better part of 60 years this policy has worked, there have been no major conflicts. We're counting dead in thousands not millions. I honestly hope our future leaders understand this policy and that the military isn't a police force for ""World Peace"" but a tool to ensure no World War III happens. Using this policy it should be clear to anyone why the US builds bases where they do and why they spend so much. It was determined to be cheaper in the long run to fund an advanced active military capable of stopping anything on the planet then it was to have another World War. Korea was an attempt to stop the spread of communism and thus prevent a large alliance between the USSR and other communistic nations. Vietnam was the same. In both case's the US was fighting Chinese fighters equipped and funded by the soviets. We won once and it yielded a country that ranks in the top 15 of world economies, we lost another and anyone can freely look up how that turned out. Also remember both Korea and Vietnam were started by Soviet backed communist factions who decided they wanted to run their respective countries. Afghanistan was a UN operation not a US one, this is commonly forgotten in world propaganda. There existed an aggressive force that decided it would like to go around attacking and harassing the USA and anyone else it liked. If the USA wouldn't of done anything then it would be been very bad. Iraq was a sh!t storm that we never should of got into. There was absolutely no geo political reason to deal with the utter nightmare that turned into. There is also no reason to stay around in Afghanistan after their ruling religious faction was destroyed, it's not the US's business to go around creating nations. I hope our future leaders learn these lessons and do not ever commit the force to any situation that isn't in the best interests of the USA.Now I'm not arguing how effective our leadership has been in following this basic principle, they are humans and humans make mistakes and can be wrong. Honestly IMO I think Obama has done a great job so far. He has not caved to the extreme left members of the Democratic party and he is obviously not a conservative.

You have to realize that that's extremely subjective, and truly a matter of opinion, not fact. That's what is biased about your claims.You then went on to list examples of those ideas that you believe to be the best, without acknowledging the fact that many of those that you brought up have caused much debate and speculation throughout the past years, many of which are still occurring today. Therefore, you cannot just assume an ‘end-all, be-all' approach and stamp your seal of approval on something and call it a ‘great idea', without first understanding the flaws and criticisms involved with them which has sparked debate. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Food Stamps are all things that require major reform in modern times, as they are just not sustainable for the future. Obamacare is an extremely hot-topic debate, and the issues of government vs. private-run healthcare are disagreements that will occur far into the foreseeable future, I'd imagine. Glass-Steagall has even had many pitfalls within the bill, which has caused loopholes for corporations to slip through the cracks, and/or cause over-regulation for corporations that didn't previously require the heavier burden. Same thing for the Depts. of Education and Energy. Just like Obamacare, those departments have caused the ever-continuing debate of having government-run programs vs. private-run programs.

sspaiva,"Your argument is interesting to me. You say I've 'provided no argument, no substance, no facts', and yet you wrote your entire post degrading mine, without offering any shred of those same arguments, substance, or facts. Interesting.Having said that, let's talk about what I believe was substance in my original post. I'm not supporting either side here, but I was trying to make the case that you can't so easily judge a person or entire political party based on purely one-sided arguments that you may hear from biased sources. Therefore, I found it funny that you chose to ignore that point, while simultaneously proving my exact point when you said the ""US GOP wouldn't get any traction because everyone would dismiss their stupidity"". Who is 'everyone' anyway? Surely, there are plenty of GOP members who would refute that. Same goes for your 'stupidity' claim, which I worry is just the term you immediately conclude to when you don't agree with someone else's opinion.Thirdly, I don't see how offering the idea that 'no party is perfect' is counter-productive here. We have an extremely polarized political system, arguably one of the worst we've ever seen. While you drive the idea of polarization further by refusing to listen to any opposing opinions, I tend to believe that understanding that both parties have flaws can be a crucial gateway to having some true bipartisanship and cooperation in our government, a trait that I believe is truly lacking. Lastly, on a side note, I'm not exactly sure why Fox News is being brought into this debate. Neither the OP or myself mentioned the organization. I fear that you bringing them up merely has to do with a common thought process that I hear often that somehow revolve around the idea that all Republicans and Fox News are intertwined together. Let me once again re-iterate the same point I've been trying to make here all along. Not all Republicans are the same. Do not treat them as such. Funny thing is, I'm not even a Republican.",0.0002058978279819712,2.888487449226318e-09,8.6160383943934e-05,4.150547283643391e-06,5.962579962215386e-05,2.8059071155439597e-07
executex,I don't understand you at all. You think Republicans are the party of intelligence? You don't think the risk of war with Iran increases when you criticize Obama and pretend he is an equal to Romney?

sspaiva,"I've noticed a continuous trend in the posts you've sent to me: you tend of jump to conclusions extremely easily, don't you?Allow me to, once again, try to explain what I'm driving at here. Nowhere in my posts to you thus far, have I made the assertion that the Republican Party is the ‘party of intelligence', while the Democratic Party is not. To quote myself from earlier, “I'm not supporting either side here, but I was trying to make the case that you can't so easily judge a person or entire political party based on purely one-sided arguments that you may hear from biased sources.”. So let's just toss that assumption from you out from the start here. So, I ask that you don't put words into your mouth to fuel an argument that you've perceived to exist, when in reality, I've never said anything of the sort.Another trend I've noticed has been the fact that you also tend to bring in side subjects that no one was mentioning earlier, and yet bring it into the argument like it was discussed all along. The first example of that was when you brought in the idea of Fox News out of right field (which I'll touch on later in this post), but then the second example just in your last post about Iran. How in the world did the concept of Iran get pulled into this? Where did that argument even come from? How is debating the equality between political parties increasing the risk of a war with Iran? Also, how does criticizing Obama also increase the same risk? Is he the only one allowed to tackle the issue of Iran?Lastly, I'll tackle to idea of Fox News again too. While I'm still not really sure how that got brought into this, let me re-iterate my last comment which actually re-iterated my first post on the subject. Maybe the third time will work here: “Not all Republicans are the same. Do not treat them as such.” So, to answer your question, no. Not ALL Republicans are intertwined with Fox News. I know it may be hard to believe. On one final side note, I have never once sworn or used vulgar language towards you in any of these discussions, so why are you swearing at me saying things like ‘are you fucking kidding me'? Why are you getting so frustrated and aggressive when someone wants to debate on an issue?",0.2775038778781891,0.00024159809981938452,0.23419839143753052,0.0007663709693588316,0.04145648330450058,0.0004356801509857178

sspaiva,"Okay. I can't keep repeating myself over and over again here. I'm going to try one last time by taking in the 5 statements you mentioned in your last comment, with the hope that in conjunction with our debate we've having in another thread, you can understand where I'm coming from. >Because the things you say are insane. You don't deserve a debate.This is the core issue here. Just because you don't agree with someone's standpoints or ideologies, does not make them insane. If you're not willing to sit down and have an intelligent debate with a person who's ideas are different than yours, then you're never going to be have perspective, a trait commonly lacking in today's polarized politics. It's okay to compromise on some things, it's okay to make mutual sacrifices, we don't always need to have this 'winner take-all', or this 'us vs. them' approach. >You actually claim Republicans are not intertwined with Fox News.This irrelevant subpoint has been going on for way too long as well. How many times do I have to say this? Are some Republicans involved in the broadcasting of Fox News? Yes. Even some Democrats are involved in the broadcasting of Fox News. But, I've said it before, and I'll say it again, not ALL Republicans are involved with the broadcasting of Fox News. Just like one would say not ALL Democrats are involved with MSNBC. It's just not fair of you to cast an entire party onto one organization, and to assume that every single person within that party is doing the same thing.>You actually claim that saying both parties are equal---is not creating a huge advantage and benefit to the Republican party including increasing the risk of war with Iran.Please refer to our debate thread for a longer analysis of this. But essentially, and I know this may be hard for you to hear, but yes. The two parties are equal. No one party is better than the other, as great ideas that have helped shaped our country into what it is today have had their genesis in both of parties. You mentioned in another posts that Democrats have increased the quality of life in this country, and if you truly think the increase of quality of life has come from solely one party or faction, then that's incomprehensible to me.Also, what is with this Iran thing? Do you honestly think that the Republican party are the only ones interested in disarming the possible nuclear capabilities of Iran? Do you not think that covert ops are already swarming that country, and disarming and disabling the Iranian technology that helps Iran create weapons?>If you felt that Iran is an important issue. If you believed that what Romney says in his speeches are true and that war in Iran would be bad.I actually don't know where you got this from, I actually don't feel that Iran is that important of an issue. The covert ops occurring in that country is suitable enough to withhold any further technological advances. In actuality, most Republican candidates, including Romney, have said the same, and have only offering the idea of striking militarily as a method of 'keeping all options on the table'. Hell, President Obama has said that.>You wouldn't work so hard to be a partisan and advocate that the two candidates are the same.How am I being partisan? I've been the one advocating the two parties are same in character, not in ideology, and I have never said Romney and Obama are exactly the same. Obviously, the two parties have differences, but that doesn't make them enemies. At least it shouldn't. The people who do make them enemies, such as yourself, are only serving to hold back to the country and remove the idea of anything progressive occurring in this country. We need compromise and unity to move forward. When there's this much polarization in Congress and in this country, that cannot happen.

The OP is demonizing an entire political party, based on thoughts he/she believes to be true, without factual evidence to justify that the literal entire party is all 'only caring about their bank accounts'.

someotherguy4112,"Has nothing to do with money or really power. Romney is running because the leaders of the GOP said he was running. Presidential candidates nor Presidents themselves are leaders in their respective party's. All parties have an agenda, goals and things they want done. To achieve those goals they have nominations and primary's to select the best candidate who can achieve those goals. After that selection all party resources go to fueling that candidate in an attempt to put them in a place of power that then can be used.

Obama also kept Bernanke for that matter.I don't think Dodd-Frank is terrible, but it just does not do nearly enough.

He also doubts that Dodd Frank resolutions will work: Will the new resolution procedures be adequate in a major financial crisis? Big banks often follow parallel business strategies and hold similar assets. In hard times, odds are that several big financial institutions will get into trouble at the same time.14 Liquid assets are a lot less liquid if these institutions try to sell them at the same time. A nightmare scenario of several big banks requiring attention might still overwhelm even the most far-reaching regulatory scheme. In all likelihood, TBTF could again become TMTF—too many to fail, as happened in 2008. A second important issue is credibility. Going into the financial crisis, markets assumed there was government backing for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds despite a lack of explicit guarantees. When push came to shove, Washington rode to the rescue. Similarly, no specific mandate existed for the extraordinary governmental assistance provided to Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup and Bank of America in the midst of the financial crisis.15 Lehman Brothers didn't get government help, but many of the big institutions exposed to Lehman did.16 Words on paper only go so far. What matters more is whether bankers and their creditors actually believe Dodd–Frank puts the government out of the financial bailout business. If so, both groups will practice more prudent behavior… The pretense of toughness on TBTF sounds the right note for the aftermath of the financial crisis. But it doesn't give the watchdog FSOC and the Treasury secretary the foresight and the backbone to end TBTF by closing and liquidating a large financial institution in a manner consistent with Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (see Box 1). The credibility of Dodd–Frank's disavowal of TBTF will remain in question until a big financial institution actually fails and the wreckage is quickly removed so the economy doesn't slow to a halt. Nothing would do more to change the risky behav- ior of the industry and its creditors.""",7.449177064700052e-05,2.012475164292482e-08,0.00012924820475745946,3.784328782785451e-06,2.5555591491865925e-05,3.6193134178574837e-07

The very fact that Khamenei sees fit to praise a point that should be taken for granted in international affairs - only in the delusional, toxic imperial ideology of the Democratic and Republican parties is it taken for granted that the United States has an incontestible right to inflict mass violence and death against any society it pleases - is a good measure of how extraordinarily aggressive Obama's posture has been. The latter has never even repudiated US military aggression against Iran as a legitimate 'option.'> [5] Politifact - President Barack Obama's campaign promise to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center has switched from In the Works to Stalled and back again (and again). All that movement reflects a simple dynamic: Obama really wants to close the center. But Congress really doesn't.This is deliberately disingenous, redefining Obama's 'campaign promise' and public opposition to Gitmo as a debate over geography. The problem with that prison camp was never the fact that it was located in the Carribbean, with Obama's (failed) effort to relocate it to Illinois or elsewhere a perfectly acceptable solution. The problem was and still is with the practices and abuses Gitmo involved - the indefinite detention of 'enemy combatants' without charge, the US military kangaroo courts and the like. None of which the Obama administration has any interest in abandoning (indeed, Obama will go down in history as the president who enshrined indefinite detention into US law by signing the NDAA). > Isn't it run of the mill to have to the best legislative record since LBJ. This one is actually pretty close to accurate. The notion that Obama and the Democrats have been ineffectual, incompetent or 'obstructed' is an apologist myth - they've actually been fantastically successful in pushing through a right-wing, class war agenda and furthering the interests of America's super-rich, corporations and banks at the expense of everyone else.

Not really a whistleblower. Steven Kim - Leaked classified about North Korea. How is this whistleblowing?

She was detained and searched, perhaps invasively, at the border when returning to the U.S. but was never arrested or charged. John Kiriakou - Charged for outting CIA agents.

Obama is making some minor policy changes here - as most presidents have over the last few decades, for better or for worse - while leaving the whole rotten structure of the drug war intact.> Shamai Leibowitz - Leaked classified FBI reports on the Israel EmbassyThose leaks [exposed a secret Israeli propaganda campaign](http://972mag.com/shamai-leibowitz-and-jonathan-pollard-a-comparison/22537/) aimed at stirring up US public opinion against Iran, in the context of a clear danger of an Israeli military strike against that country to boot.> Jeffrey Sterling - Seems to have leaked some unidentified classified informationThat classified information was leaked to a US journalist and [""exposed CIA torture, rendition and other illegal and barbaric practices.""](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2011/feb2011/ster-f04.shtml) In addition to past CIA dirty tricks against Iran.> Steven Kim - Leaked classified about North Korea. How is this whistleblowing?I agree with you on this one. Kim himself [claims the information he passed to the media was nothing controversial or notable](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/27/steven-kim-state-department-contractor-charged-leak_n_697734.html). This seems more like an example of the Obama administration's vindictive obsession with secrecy than their targeting of those who bring official crimes to light, though the distinction doesn't make them look much better.> Laura Poitras - An independent reporter who spent two years living with Iraqi Sunnis in 2004/5. She was detained and searched, perhaps invasively, at the border when returning to the U.S. but was never arrested or charged. Journalists and filmmakers being repeatedly (not just once) detained, searched and harassed by the state for their political views and activities is perfectly OK... so long as you're not charged with a (non-existent) crime?> John Kiriakou - Charged for outting CIA agents.CIA agents responsible for the torture of detainees, yeah. Kiriakou and Manning are both proof that exposing crimes is far more likely to end in criminal prosecution than actually committing them in the USA.> Julian Assange - Hasn't been charged, doubt he ever will be or NYT, etc. will have to be charged as well.If an indictment under the Espionage Act is the official response to people like Kiriakou, it goes without saying that Assange - who's exposed ten times what the others have combined - will be seeing something similar. To say an Assange prosecution would mandate indictment of the NYT (which [worked hand in hand with the White House to frame their coverage in a pro-war, pro-government light](http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/jul2010/time-j28.shtml)) ignores that American law is now pretty nakedly political and arbitrary; the refusal to prosecute (or to hold to *any* standard of accountability) Bush administration officials and CIA operatives who now [publicly boast about their war crimes](http://www.salon.com/2012/04/25/crime_boasting_for_profit/) is a case in point.And all of this goes back to what I said about a political motivation. The only way you can claim most of these cases aren't instances of whistleblowing is if you're claiming the stuff that was exposed - like the CIA waterboarding somebody who was never accused of a crime 83 times - is perfectly OK, so much so that it needs to be hidden from a public that's too stupid to make up its own mind.> You should look up the history of Iran US relations, the kind of endorsement Obama got is extremely rare in that regard.Except it plainly wasn't an endorsement of Obama. It was an endorsement of a single statement *from* Obama urging diplomacy over war, in the context of an extremely punitive campaign (one that's always been backed with the threat of outright military aggression) against Iran.> You are ignoring the point that relocating these prisoners would have given them rights as they would be within US jurisdiction, the issue of geography is actually very important.Not so. Gitmo has been explicitly under US jurisdiction since 2004, when it came up in two key Supreme Court cases. Obama's 'relocation' plan was [overtly designed to maintain everything that made Gitmo such an international outrage,](http://www.salon.com/2012/07/23/the_obama_gitmo_myth/) including indefinite detention without charge. > As for indefinite detention, can you explain how Bush was able to indefinitely detain TWO US citizens before NDAA if it was Obama who enshrined it into law.The same way Obama legally justified his indefinite detention regime: claiming these vast powers were implicitly granted to the executive branch under the post-9/11 Authorization for the Use of Military Force. If you look back at the NDAA 'debate,' Obama initially opposed the detention provisions because it was detailing executive powers that he already claimed and exercised under the AUMF.> Please explain how is taking out banks from the student loan market, raising capital gains taxes on the super rich to pick just two examples a 'right wing class war agenda'.First, he didn't take the banks out of the student loan market. Sallie Mae, the banks and other private interests (especially those who service the massive federal loan program) are still making hefty profits on hundreds of billions in student debt. What you're talking about is a 2010 'reform' that ended federal subsidies for private loans... but to save the government money, not students, who are more fucked now than they've ever been.Second, Obama hasn't raised capital gains on the super-rich. He's *proposed* a marginal increase for 2013, to levels far lower than what we saw for most of the 20th century at that. And since it's a proposal, this is basically meaningless - the Democrats specialize in 'populist' pledges and rhetoric when it comes time to win an election (remember ""Hope and Change""? ""Main Street, not Wall Street""?) that's ditched not long after they come to power. The Democrats' extension of the Bush tax cuts - pretty blatantly reneging on a promise they'd be making for almost a decade - is a perfect example.",4.210776387481019e-05,1.0103694547680675e-09,1.689145756245125e-05,2.5794017801672453e-06,1.487080953666009e-05,1.6960375148755702e-07

stewbeef,"The problem with this country is the ""us vs. them"" attitude of liberals and conservatives alike. This is a problem even the founding fathers warned against that arises when political parties come to be. If you can associate with a team, you can associate against one. The biggest problem in our country (and with the most recent elections) is that when it comes to the media (whether fox news, msnbc, cnn, or many papers/internet sources) there is an intentional effort on the part of executives and the editors they control to steer public opinion away from meaningful issues and toward divisive, frightening, and enraging distractions that boost ratings. These, from both sides, distract you from the fact that policies of Obama are ineffective or the budgets proposed by Romney and Ryan are dangerous for the future of America. Our country is built on greed, so it's not surprising that around half the population (conservative or not) is pissed they lose money to taxes, want to pay less, and want to make as much money as possible. But it's also a great point to make that when it comes to netting 6 million dollars in a year as opposed to 8, it's not socialism. Those two million dollars prevent the fights over money and groceries in my middle class home, prevent the bankruptcies and foreclosures because the middle class boosts the economy and therefore creates the jobs.

Republicans were elected to end the Korean War. The Republicans were elected to end the Vietnam War. There's a strong tradition of being anti-war, in the Republican Party. It is the constitutional position. It is the advice of the founders to follow a non-interventionist foreign policy. Stay out of entangling alliances. Be friends with countries. Negotiate and talk with them and trade with them. Just think of the tremendous improvement of relationships with Vietnam. We lost 60 thousand men. We came home in defeat.

Fizjig,"I do not claim to be a Democrat, and I have been open minded to hearing ideas from Republicans. Here is the problem I run into. Many Republicans force feed their religious views into everything they do. At times they do this to the detriment of their own party, because frankly, many people who claim to have Christian values don't understand the concepts their own religion teaches. Paul's writings in the Bible, and the teachings of Jesus are not one and the same. There are fundamental differences between the two that contradict each other. Instead of understanding their faith and trying to come up with an educated opinion of their own on the subject, they choose to tow an ignorant party line that makes them sound like uneducated assholes. I believe, at their core people with Republican views have good intentions. I just feel that their party has become so extremist that it is hard to take anything they say at face value. Romney comes across as an Arrogant fuck that will lie, beg, cheat, steal, and sell your mother to win the election. Maybe that's not a fair view, but it is the reputation he has built in many peoples eyes. Even John McCain is like WTF is wrong with this guy. Instead of putting forth a decent candidate people on the Republican side are willing to vote for this clown simply, because he is not Obama. That's like gouging out your eyes, so that you don't have to wear glasses. If you want people to stop bashing your party then get some representatives in your party who are not batshit crazy, extremists. One more thing.

EasyTac,"This is actually an excellent critique of American politics. It's not perfect, but it's very good. The reason it's good is that it accurately characterizes a major component of the Republican party: Really rich people or corporations who want to use the government to protect their private wealth. I don't think anyone can dispute that that is a major component of the Republican party. Let's have a look though, just to be sure. Yay!The Republican party caters to these people in a number of ways. First, there are tax cuts. That puts money right back in their pockets. Of course, the sister to the tax cut is slashing the government. In the extreme case (read: Paul Ryan's wet dream) you get rid of any and all government functions that don't benefit the rich. That's a lot of government functions. Medicare, welfare, Pell grants, Social Security... On and on. It leaves you with what Milton Friedman (not necessarily a bad guy in my view) and Paul Ryan (are you serious?) are happy to inform you are the essential functions of government: more or less just basic infrastructure and the military. These things are percieved by the rich to benefit the rich, so they get to stay.Besides taxing and spending policy, another great way to protect wealthy interests is to ensure that their cash cows remain viable in the face of major changes to their business environment. The Koch Bros. are bank rolling Romney, and Harold Hamm is his top energy advisor. See where this is going? Fossil fuels are not a long term solution to our energy needs. Solar and wind energy are. Any forward thinking government would subsidize the hell out of this stuff so that we can meet our energy needs in the future. But that would amount to undermining the Koches's and Hamm's cash cows. It would mean that sooner rather than later, someone would replace those guys as America's energy tycoons. Instead of the really-rich-guy-because-he-owns-the-oil-company, we will someday have the really-rich-guy-because-he-owns-the-solar-company. Despite all of their money, the Koches and Harold Hamm are too stupid and lazy to try to become the really-rich-solar-guy, so instead they just bankroll and advise prominent Republicans in hopes that the energy revolution never takes place. It's a much more cost effective way to stay rich.The amazing thing about Romney is that it's all just become so fucking comically obvious with him. What's he running on? Whatever gets him votes. He didn't decide to run for president to ""Repeal and Replace Obamacare,"" *he invented Obamacare!* But he'll stand there with a sign that amounts to saying, ""My own program sucks, vote for me and I'll get rid of it"" because it gets him votes. A weaker man would crumble under the sheer hypocrisy. But not Mitt. Mitt's campaign must go on.So why is he really running? I think part of it is just good old fashioned egotism. This figures he should be president because he smartest and handsomest and his sperms only carry Y chromosomes. But the bigger part is to protect and serve whoever is wealthy *right now.* He's not helping out the future energy tycoons. He's helping out the current ones. And by getting rid of Pell grants, he's increasing the chances that any future energy tycoons will come from rich families. So when the day does come that the solar guy has more money than the oil guy, we can all rest easy that the social order didn't get shuffled too much in the process.TL:DR-- OP is right and here is why.",3.0993096515885554e-06,5.575064368490423e-11,1.9017026033907314e-06,2.2053683323974838e-07,1.0847370504052378e-06,1.1148465262067475e-08

MrMathamagician,I know it's the /r/politics way to demonize everything on the right without any reason or evidence but this is the worst one I've seen in awhile.Romney is massively wealthy and has spent a significant portion of his fortune running for president. Be as hateful to him as you want but you sound like an idiot when you claim he's doing it for his bank account. Practically any other reason you could come would make more sense.,0.0056233578361570835,6.950952524675813e-08,0.00033297704067081213,7.774712139507756e-05,0.0008059688261710107,9.361902812088374e-06
