I thought we were in agreement about late term abortions. 20+ week ban is not comparable to an altogether ban whatsoever.>If abortion is a matter of women's rights then Americans have this whacky tendencyI don't think your *wacky tendency* dig was necessary. Whether it is a matter of women's rights or not is clearly what is debatable. You agree that late term abortions are a human rights issue against the baby. Don't you see that someone else could feel the same way about a week 6 abortion?Back to the wacky tendency, Americans actually apply that worldwide, and especially within the United Nations. There are levels to what we consider worth pushing regarding human rights at the state, USA, UN, and world levels. Do you think we should push for legal abortions throughout the UN? If not, why not? If so, what about the entire world?I agree there are some people on the right who believe that abortions should be banned throughout the USA, and those people are most likely driven by religious reasons. I don't agree that the people who want a state to decide for itself are necessarily religious. On a side not, but not too important, why does it matter to you if their reason is religious? If I told you theft was wrong, and I wont change that conviction because of my religion, does that make my opinion invalid to you? You may make up your might on a question of right vs wrong based on whatever branch of metaphysics seems correct to you, but what argument do you have against those who subscribe to a different philosophy, and why is that argument any better or worse than someone whose convictions come from religion?>Those trying to ban it aren't doing so because it would be fiscally responsible. They want to ban it for religious reasons. It isn't a states' rights issue.For me, it is a states rights issue. I have no religious issue, but I support states rights.

It is; what dose, what precautions, what alergies, what symptoms, what age permission, prescription or not, how avalable, etc. 2 SSM has never been a right. It's a new 'right' concept. It has nothing to do with acceptance. People know knowledge and death are real, but the concept of putting your brain into a computer is a new futuristic idea.

Whenever possible, Democrats will prioritize prevention and treatment over incarceration when tackling addiction and substance use disorder. We will build on effective models of drug courts, veterans' courts, and other diversionary programs that seek to give nonviolent offenders opportunities for rehabilitation as opposed to incarceration.>Because of conflicting federal and state laws concerning marijuana, we encourage the federal government to remove marijuana from the list of “Schedule 1"" federal controlled substances and to appropriately regulate it, providing a reasoned pathway for future legalization. We believe that the states should be laboratories of democracy on the issue of marijuana, and those states that want to decriminalize it or provide access to medical marijuana should be able to do so. We support policies that will allow more research on marijuana, as well as reforming our laws to allow legal marijuana businesses to exist without uncertainty. And we recognize our current marijuana laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates.**Republican:**>The progress made over the last three decades against drug abuse is eroding, whether for cultural reasons or for lack of national leadership.

FFF_in_WY,"The electoral process is the problem. Bipartisan consensus is the problem. The power of lobbying money going to the red team and the blue team from the same sources is the problem.It's theoretically possible to reform the Republicrat party from within, but let's look at the practicality of that. Sanders ran as a Democrat for pragmatic reasons. I was at my state caucuses, where the long term legit dems were fighting tooth and nail to keep their delegates going to HRC, because they thought it 'unfair' that a career Independent / Democratic Socialist was trying to steal the nomination of 'their' party. Sanders won the caucuses 56% to 44% in Wyoming. However, once the super delegates got to play they're cards, HRC took 11 of the state's total delegates to his 7. That means she lost the vote by 12% but won the delegate count by 19%. Phrased differently, she enjoyed 31% flip.This is a pretty good analog or microcosm for what it's like trying to reform the legacy parties from within. Three - and preferably more - parties helps give the people an opportunity to address the issues in my first paragraph with a little less interference from entrenched systems.It isn't a magic bullet, and the biggest problem with our republic is much more comprehensive: we're occasionally voters, but we're almost never citizens.

I don't want to come off as really cynical, but don't you think that lobbyists would be able to buy influence in third parties as well? One thing this election taught me is that things like the Clinton machine are not as powerful as they would have us believe. Everyone everywhere thought she would win. I thought there would be no contest because I actually believed Clinton had enough power to not let herself lose. I was one of those people who complained that it was rigged anyway so why vote. This election renewed my faith in the process. My reason for bringing this up is that a few months ago I would have told you that even if 3 parties were popular, people like Clinton and the DNC would have rigged things against Bernie anyway, regardless of how he ran. I now believe it is actually possible to open up the system, despite it still being way more difficult than many people think. Just voting wont do it.

FFF_in_WY,"The intrinsic value of alternative parties in terms of lobbying influence is that those in-roads aren't established - yet. I have no illusions that they wouldn't be built eventually, but the interim time available would provide a party with a relatively clean slate and a real shot at people-first policy advocacy. Plus the people working in a new party have a high probability for being idealistic and more difficult to corrupt. Politicians in the legacy parties are often cynics looking for a pay off or a revolving door.This election merely confirmed my suspicion that Americans are still angry and only marginally rational. When given the choice between Giant Douche and Turd Sandwich by the legacy parties, this still persuaded almost no one to look further down the ballot for more palatable options. The outcomes simply serve to point out the massive disservice done to the country by the kingmakers of the RNC and the DNC. These two candidate were both objectively terrible candidates, and they forced them into the general election anyway.As it stands, the caucus / primary system gives a tiny portion of the country the standing to thrust their will upon the entire electorate. Sure, people could go join up and fight the battle from within, but the given how that went this election season (particularly for progressives that jumped in for Bernie), I doubt we'll see participation in the legacy parties increase. I hope I'm wrong.You're right that the alternative party candidates sucked again this year. What we need is enough popular outcry to pull in a charismatic outsider or two to 3rd parties. People don't want to go do the work themselves yet - Americans spend 4.5 hours a day watching TV. They need a symbol that they can rally behind. That's what Trump is: the awful piece of crap that was still marketed as the best symbol for change this year.On the whole, I'm not really hopeful that national-level politics will change until things get much worse. This year is a prime example. So, you're not the only cynic. But I won't recuse myself from the process, because I am constitutionally incapable.

[Source, October 2015](http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/hillary-clinton-book-tour-108571)* Regarding Chelsea Clinton, she did not say people died directly from marijuana use but that they had from interactions between other drugs and marijuana.

[Source](http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/hillary-clinton-marijuana/)All that being said, I'm on the internet and I would be remiss if didn't shit my own opinion into the fray here. So from this point on, it's all editorial:Hillary is a professional politician who notoriously plays it safe when it comes to public speaking. She waffles her opinions, just like every other politician, and personally that's not something I like. You can say people's views change over time but there are some things she champions now that she only VERY recently came out in support of, and the timing of that support is sometimes suspect (prime example, gay marriage support).Pot was legal in the US until the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. The reason it became illegal in the first place is extremely suspect, considering some of the main reasons for its illegalization were its:* ability to cause men of color to become violent and solicit sex from white women* association with Mexican immigrants who were being propagandized at the time as violent and undesirableUp until that point marijuana (more commonly known to the US population during that time as cannabis, and no one was trying very hard to make that association apparent to the layman) was legal and in fact used in many medicines. Because of this, it seems silly to me that there would be such grand discussion about if it's ""dangerous"" to legalize it when it wasn't considered dangerous in the first place until someone had a political axe to grind.On top of all of that, even though the MTA of 1937 was later ruled unconstitutional, marijuana was then immediately lumped into the most restrictive category (or ""Schedule"") of the Controlled Substances Act in the 1970s as a ""placeholder"". Its proper placement was effectively put on hold until then-president Richard Nixon could formally and officially provide a recommendation on its proper placement within the Act.Well, considering Nixon was full-swing on his War on Drugs it would make sense that he would come down harshly on any drug, and it's even less of a stretch to see why he would continue illegalizing a drug that two entire generations of his citizens had grown up only knowing as an illegal substance. He was met with basically no opposition and it kept its place as a Schedule I substance.Long story short, marijuana probably shouldn't have been made illegal in the first place and as such it's silly to have a debate about now making it recreationaly legal. That being said, if it's going to be used in medicine then it absolutely should be tested rigorously just like ever other substance identified as medicine. Currently the political and public opinion of it seems to be switched, however, and medical marijuana is seen as a gateway to recreational marijuana, when in actuality it should be the exact opposite.Thanks for reading!",0.0009297609212808311,5.6513112411948896e-08,0.00021322436805348843,2.37963813560782e-05,0.0001564223348395899,3.984966497228015e-06

berrieh,">Well that's not very fair. Do you really think Republicans currently are for slavery and segregation? I know that the parties have switched places several times so if we are going based off of current party platforms you can't really include those things.No, but that poster was speaking to what has been done in the name of States' rights and what hasn't. I would not say Republicans are pro-slavery and I do not think they want de juro segregation (many GOP seem to want to amplify de facto segregation, but that existed all over the US and was not a States' Rights issue). >True, but it was Republican appointed justices that voted for abortion rights in Roe v. Wade in the first place.Sure, some were, but not because the GOP supported it or anything. Because the Justices found it legitimately Constitutional. The two dissenters were of different parties (Renquist appointed by Nixon; White by Kennedy). That doesn't change that the States' rights people use it as fodder and want the states to have the right to restrict the rights of individual women... The GOP routinely passes laws that erode women's rights, like the recent one in TX to charge mothers to cremate the remains of aborted fetuses. >I will give you those, but as I said before Trump advocates for state rights on those issues.

What's important is their platform. It's not like picking a sport team. A summary of their switches: >Northern (and later coastal) “City” Interests: Federalists, Whigs, Third Party Republicans, Fourth Party Progressive era Republicans (like Teddy), Fifth Party Democrats (starting in the 1930's under FDR, then culminating with LBJ and then Clinton), Modern Democrats.>Southern (and later middle) “Rural” Interests: Anti-Federalists, Democratic-Republicans, Third Party Democrats, Fourth Party Progressive Era Democrats (Like Wilson), Fifth Party Republicans (starting in the 1920's under Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, then culminating with Nixon and then Bush), Modern Republicans.>The south is still the south, the north is still the north, a city is still is a city, and rural voters are still rural. That isn't what changed. In any era, geopolitical voters still have their unique vices, like those evidenced by shameful Jim Crow Southern politics or the under-represented Southern Black Belt, or those evidenced by Northern Ghettos filled with refugees from the great migration and working class immigrants. They also have their unique virtues, be they fighting for individual rights, fairness for the farmer, and protecting jobs at home, or for fighting for collective social justice, workers rights, minority rights, and the global trade and central banking that ensures America's status as a Hegemonic superpower. Sure, at times the divide in America is a single voter issue or economic class struggle, but the basic city/north vs. rural/south split is nearly constant.

Tuft64,"Except that doesn't matter if the party doesn't even resemble what it once was.If the Republican party 100 years from now started to advocate the means of production being expropriated from the capitalist class, it wouldn't be fair to say ""WELL LOOK AT 100 YEARS AGO, DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT REPUBLICANS ARE BIG BUSINESS CORPORATE SHILLS"".As far as specifics go, the republicans were a new party in Lincoln's day. They were a conglomeration of various northern former Whig constituencies and people that wanted to develop the west that coalesced due to issues surrounding slavery. Generally speaking, they retained a lot of the older Whig economic views that the government should be involved in the economy. It should promote policies that promote growth, they thought. That meant financing infrastructure, education, protecting native industries, policies that promoted commerce and rapid job growth. They did believe in more federal involvement in all these things, and it cost money. They were the forward looking, innovative party, and also vaguely speaking they were the ""big government"" party and had policies that promoted big banks, big industry, big business.The democrats were the more tradition-minded party. They were also the party focused on keeping taxes low and when it came to promoting commerce, etc... wanted to leave it to the states. Generally speaking, they were the ""states' rights"" party.The shift started after the Civil War and continued for over 135 years. After the civil war, the republicans started to split into factions generally divided between how deep ""in bed"" you got with big business, so they developed a conservative business wing often at odds with with the more progressive wing. The democrats pretty much stayed the states rights party and were marginalized at the national level for several decades.Key points in the shift to the structure we know today:1896: William Jennings Bryan incorporates the Populist Party vote, giving the democrats a sizable left wing on economics that it didn't have before. 1912: Theodore Roosevelt breaks from the republicans and runs as the candidate of the Progressive Party - this makes the republican progressive wing - once a third to a half of the republican coalition, much less committed to the party going forward and they never really reconcile. Republican leadership comes more and more from its conservative wing after that.1932-45: Franklin Roosevelt essentially adopts most of the old Progressive platform and pretty much incorporates that whole vote into his Democratic coalition. This puts the party on a collision course when it comes to social policy. 1964: Lyndon Johnson essentially divorces the longest marriage the democratic party had: the one with southern whites. By making Civil Rights part of the Democratic platform, the republicans lose basically all of what's left of their black constituencies - which had been a significant part of their remaining progressive vote in northern urban areas. The democrats start to hemorrhage southern whites rapidly - you see George Wallace run for president in 1968.2000: The process is 98% complete. By this time liberals are in the democrats and conservatives in the republicans for the most part.There are more complexities within and after that but those are the major turning points. The current situation we have was solidified during the Lewinsky scandal of 1998 and the ensuing 2000 election. So you can see this was a very, very long process. Circa the late 1990s you saw the last generation that had republican liberals and democratic conservatives.",2.476778900017962e-05,4.684703180934946e-10,8.873232218320481e-06,7.625874332006788e-07,3.1762829166837037e-06,8.863803913072843e-08

Look at Pence's obsession with gays, insistence that it's a choice, and support of conversion therapy.

We know he wants his VP to do all the work because he previously asked Kasich to be his VP and take care of domestic policy. When Kasich asked what Trump would be busy doing, he said, ""I'll be making America great again.""

The end result is university still cost more for CA residents now than it did even two years ago, which was more than it cost two years before that.

Like Gary Johnson said this election, we've got 50 labortories where we can try new ideas and then hopefully adopt the best.Take same sex marriage.

Its honestly a shame that the Colorado universal healthcare didn't pass, because that could have been another step in the right direction.I'm not an ideologue when it comes to libertarianism (e.g. not opposed to universal healthcare that works, etc), but I do think they have the right idea in terms of states rights. People always argue about the negative aspects of states rights, like states who defund planned parent hood, or fears of descrimination, but as same sex marriage has shown us, when something works the majority will adopt it, and drag those other states along.

We'd be two countries with some really fucked up borders.This assumes people would be willing to relocate based on how much they were for/against these issues. I'm really dubious of this as a concept, but it's the basis of your argument.Personally, I think what we really need to do is find ways to become more centrist as a country and stop letting the nuts on the far left and far right dictate where we go.I think one of the best things we could do is to get rid of the electoral college and make voting mandatory. That way you can get a clear view of what the majority of the country wants instead of who is shouting loudest from the far reaches of either side. I think this would provide wins for both sides. Many social issues would be won by the left (most people don't give two shits about who marries who) and a lot of fiscal issues would go right (most people think the government spends too much).I think we should be looking for ways to become more *united* as a county instead of more *divided*.",0.0004663048021029681,1.1268482147386294e-08,6.347259477479383e-05,1.0749901775852777e-05,6.998707249294966e-05,1.5572476286251913e-06

The san fran voter has very different interests than the out in the sticks voter, and the more populous the cities get the easier it is to drown out the sticks. That's a terrible, terrible fuckin' idea. A system that alienates any significant portion of the country is a bad thing, no matter what portion that is. Population trends and the switch to the service sector for most American lower middle class work ensure that those sticks voters are just going to get more discontent, and having one half of the people who make their laws theoretically represent them more than the other half of the country is a wonderful fig branch. When people feel their interests aren't represented in government, and that the government is unduly punishing them without their say, you get civil unrest. Every time.

auandi,"Really, even after this election you're still pushing ""they're both the same"" nihilism? The two parties are not the same, and if you think that you simply are not paying attention in an effort to feel superior to both in a misguided act of self-promotion and defiance.Change happens, you just have to expand your time horizon. There have been several major restructurings of the US government, but they took time. Do you think change comes easily? Have you never read about the history of the labor movement? Or the suffragettes? Or the Anti-Saloon League? I would also caution about how you talk about the US. It's going through a tumultuous period, but so has every major democracy on earth. And while the next few years are going to suck hard, we are very very far from a failed state.The larger problem to me is not even the senate's imbalance of power, or the electoral college giving the election to the person with the less votes, it's the fact that 60+ million Americans looked at Trump and found him acceptable. That's not a government problem, that's a people problem. There exist no set of real facts which could logically justify this unless you are an open white supremacist. We may have more racists than we like to admit, but white racists alone can't win an election. In the past when a party picked someone ""outside the norm"" like Goldwater or McGovern you saw 45+ state landslides against him.

auandi,"They did an amazing job...... for their time.Their instincts were good, some of their assumptions were off. They simply had no data of real life experiences to draw from without the *very* brief and not very democratic English Commonwealth or the ancient and failed democracies of the classical age.Good science requires that we adapt to the results and data we get. The founders were huge and unwavering believers in the scientific method and the enlightenment. They believed that observation of data would lead to truth and rightness. And after several centuries of political history, countless revolutions, and the failure and rebuilding of almost every other government on earth, we have new information today that they did not have back then.The reason they chose not to have a parliament is they feared what a prime minister could do. They feared that if the executive and legislative branches commingled, than a particularly charismatic leader could rise up and get his loyalists to amass power, shutting down democratic opposition.That is a rightful fear.But evidence shows this is less likely to happen for one key reason they did not think of. When a leader tries to amass power in a parliament, he can only do so with the help of the rest of his party. And dictators don't like to share power with anyone. So would be dictators have a challenge, they must convince the majority of their party to accept less power so he can have more. Members of parliament don't like to give up what power they have, so they usually don't allow that to happen. They serve as a natural check because it is in their self interest that the Prime Minister not amass too much power because power in government is a zero sum game.If a president wants to gain more power he can. Congress can refuse to pass laws the President wants, but the President is in charge of the military, in charge of law enforcement, in charge of executing every law and every agency as they see fit. They are the singular head of government. If the President simply starts directing the agencies he unilaterally runs to act as if a law was passed, there's not much Congress can do short of impeachment (and they have no mechanism to enforce that). The founders were concerned that the ones writing the laws and the ones executing the laws should not be in the same body, but by placing them in different bodies they actually ended up making it *harder* for congress to do anything to stop a dictator president.That's why in 1918 when there were dozens of new democracies flourishing across Europe, we suggested that every single one of them adopt a parliament. We also recommended proportional representation, but that turned out to have it's own dysfunctional problems. So in 1945 and beyond, any time a nation approaches the US to help them write a constitution we still recommend a parliament. I'm under no illusion that the US will change to that system, a president is simply too ingrained in us as a culture. But Prime Ministers must face off directly against other powerful members of parliament to have any power himself. Presidents are given power regardless of their relationship with Congress, meaning there is nothing to stop a dictator president.",0.0006804356235079467,3.824232663873772e-08,0.00017841039516497403,1.7360096535412595e-05,8.88675422174856e-05,2.7288165256322827e-06

The key here is that you have one overarching federal government where people still vote on the Commander in Chief every 4 years. Then there are 2 other sub-countires consisting of either the red or blue states from that executive election. Red states form one sub-federal government, and the blue states form another. These red and blue sub-countries get to operate their own legislature and make their own federal laws that have no bearing on the other.

urbanastronaut,"This is an interesting concept, but I think switching the legislatures and federal law every 4 years would be a nightmare. Imagine a swing state that would have to re-haul it's government every 4 years. Not to mention the economic cost of changing out official headings on fixtures and documents every 4 years that must have a ""Sub-Country"" heading. (Ex. Changing the signs every 4 years from ""United States Republic Postal Service"" to ""United States Democracy Postal Service."" And that's just a small problem in that sort of society. Imagine the split it would cause citizens in certain states. Right now, Americans are pretty split over our Presidential election. Imagine the anger it sparks during that period of time, and then also add the worry that your state's sub-countryhood might completely change the dynamic of your state. The elections suck, but I'm happy I don't have to suddenly worry about gobbled into whichever state the mid-West would become.

damnmachine,"Read some of the ignorant, closed-minded comments on the WaPo article. It's amazing how reefer madness ideologies continue to persist in a sizable subsect of our population in 2016. My argument almost always boils down to this: You don't like cannabis? Fine. You don't like people that *do* enjoy cannabis? You're kind of an asshole but still, fine. Do you enjoy alcohol or tobacco products? Cool. How is cannabis in any way ""worse"" or less ""acceptable"" than those? And even if you are some kind of puritan that has NO vices of your own (which is rare), what the FUCK does it matter to you what other people put in their bodies?Gets me fired up sometimes.EDIT: This comment takes the cake: **AMERICAN 4 TRUMP**6:27 PM EST""I know from college in the 1970s to raising children in the 90s and 00s that Weed is a very dangerous drug that should not be legal.

Because the Democrats wanted SO badly to pass this bill, they pushed it through so hard that they didn't bother getting it through the joint committees to get that ironing through because they knew that if they took too long to do so, it would involve getting trying to get more Republican support and Republicans in what are supposed to be bipartisan committees to iron out the bill.

Syliase,"I think I'm not communicating this well, so I'm really sorry. Also, checked my notes from my ConLaw and FedPol classes--we were told that the senate had a Republican minority although technically, the Senate was almost split evenly (not to mention, a lot of moderates on both sides, so right-leaning dems and left-leaning reps), but the house was dominated by the Democrats, led by Joe Biden, against a republican minority which was extremely vocal (so, yes, you're right numbers wise--but in poli-sci, at least from what I've learned, it's less about the numbers and more about the intricacies of voter will, constituency, lobbying, and all that factors into motives). That said, in the senate, all democrats voted for the ACA, and even in the house, it got passed (barely) despite some resistance there as well. Before the opposition could do anything to repeal it, the Dems pushed the bill too quickly through the system. Also, fun fact: When the bill was first introduced, it was passed by both H & S despite getting so much backlash by the Republicans. But it's not ~entirely~ true that the Republicans unanimously went against the ACA because none of them wanted it. In fact, some of the provisions of the ACA came from a past bill the Reps themselves tried to pass a couple decades before. I remember in class, we had a discussion on 'why the sudden change' and a lot of it had to do with the fact that it was more welfare, less private care. Not only that, but after the bill was enacted, all criticisms of the ACA were pretty valid, too, considering that it was not ironed out correctly whatsoever. Does that make sense? Again, sorry if I'm not being clear, a lot of this stuff I admit I'm trying to summon from the top of my head instead of digging through my notes.

Especially when he's taken executive action on other matters and that is being used by the red team to divide us further. So executive action, right or wrong though the actual action may be, _should_ be taken with caution. I'm not even saying that this action should or should not be taken mind you, just that having restraint itself is a quality, not a bug.Actually thinking a thing over, considering others beliefs, even ones you don't hold, and being cautious, is IMPORTANT.A president should not take all actions he/she is entitled to, even when the ends are just. He/She _should_ consider other factors. Executive action must be a very deliberate tool. And the powers give to a president, whatever they may be, should not be off-the-cuff.The tide is turning on Pot, but many in the heartland still view it as a dangerous drug.

You're right in that case - if someone didn't vote because they didn't care enough to, I don't think their opinion about the election is as relevant as somebody who was active in attempting to elect a candidate they believed in. But I think that if someone was genuinely unhappy with the choices they were forced to vote for and decided to vote for neither, their opinions are just as relevant as someone who didn't support one candidate or the other.tldr edit: I feel that someone who was displeased with both candidates has as much of a valid opinion as someone who is displeased with the current president-elect, even if they could/""should"" have put their vote towards third party as a symbolic gesture.

Jaxyl,That's how I explained it to my debaters after they questioned why Donald Trump wasn't ruined when any of his many scandals broke. Negative publicity is harmful to a candidate when you have an opponent that is well liked. Take Obama: his approval and likability ratings are at an all time high because people are constantly comparing Trump to him.The problem is that Hillary Clinton had terrible likability and trustworthiness numbers so when you compared Trump's latest scandal to Clinton you had a decreased effect because they're both bad. It's all about perception and the Clinton campaign let Trump and co. control her image because of reasons (hubris/they thought the electorate was smarter/etc...). Mind you the Clinton campaign didn't really try that hard to fight the allegations (i.e. when the head of the DNC is implicated in a scandal of corruption that benefited your campaign you don't hire her when she steps down).It all boils down to comparisons. Trump got away with it because Clinton had such negative perception that all of his scandals weren't viewed through a proper lens.,5.964916636003181e-05,2.335276638731898e-09,1.801828148018103e-05,2.9704383450734895e-06,9.921800483425613e-06,3.6792238233829266e-07
Penuwana,"Personally I see Trump as a blunt tool, and Hillary as a lethal, yet poorly aimed, weapon.

Jaxyl,"The other side, to me at least and this is my personal opinion with nothing to support my claim, is that our societal perception of Trump was different compared to Clinton. Now this isn't a sexism thing, it's more about the US' perception of the perceived wrong.The US hate cheaters and those that cheat the system. While I think, deep down, we all know that politics is somewhat dirty, we don't like to acknowledge it. Instead we turn a blind eye to the issues so long as they aren't glaring us in the face or cross certain lines. In Hillary's case, the e-mail situation exposed the underworkings of Washington in a way we haven't seen since Nixon. I liken it to the sausage analogy: Everyone loves sausage but they definitely don't want to know how it's made.From there we saw those same connections in the DNC and how they were used to actively hold down a surging challenger (note: I'm not looking to debate whether Sanders would have won without the DNC collusion, point is we'll never know because the game was different from the start). This gave Clinton a perception of a cheater that couldn't be denied. Mind you Republicans have been ""stacking the deck"", so to speak, for decades but they've never been caught this red handed before, so Clinton was alone and branded by public perception as someone who actively cheated to succeed. This, in turn, meant that any extra allegations were going to have an amplifying effect on her because she was already being viewed as negatively as she was.Trump, on the other hand, got away with it because of our countries racist and sexist history. Now I'm not saying we're racist or sexist anymore, but we have a lot of artifacts from that time in our society, namely Baby Boomers (not all, but some). I'd argue that most of us know at least one older to elderly person who is a great person with a lot of heart, they just happen to be a racist/sexist/whatever. This desensitizes us to a degree because when we see these people we, on average, ignore their respective-isms to accept them for the other parts of them. In the case of Trump, I feel like a lot of his supporters disagreed with him on a lot of his positions but accepted the rest of him because it's what we do to others.Of course that doesn't make it right and this is literally the ramblings of a single person on the internet with waaaay too much time on their hands (sitting at debate tournaments as a coach can get super boring). There is nothing to prove this and I 100% recognize that you, or anyone else, could just say it's bullshit and move on.Just wanted to share and see your thoughts.",0.04950496181845665,2.0316063000791473e-06,0.014597400091588497,9.342453995486721e-05,0.0033260961063206196,2.5607214411138557e-05

You need to look at what is scare tactics and what are facts. In regards to people being deported....yes, that probably will split up families.

Of course its not nice but at the same time, there needs to be enforcement in regards to immigration. That is not Trump's fault if people are here illegally, its the immigrant's fault for not going to the immigration process. Canada has a stricter immigration process than the United States does but I dont hear anyone getting up in arms about that. Its because its been established and enforced for so long that its just normal. But here, theres been no enforcement and the process is not refined.

Think how much more Americans will vote for Progress as presented by an actual progressive. I am very excited by the idea that America has this giant progressive undercurrent that is only held back by a conservative establishment, and only when they do everything in their power to restrict voting rights and gerrymander the districts and rely on a system that effectively gives conservative rural people extra votes. So, eventually it seems as though the system is going to snap under all that tension and progressivism will take over, and that certainly will be beautiful (I hope). Because once progressives actually win big, they could just unjerrymander (or regerrymander, hopefully not, but they might) everything and create a surge in voting rights that would cause a massive upshoot in support, by breaking the tension keeping that support back. But this also brings me fear, because I think most conservatives are aware of this too. And I think that their response might actually be fascistic. It might actually be to start creating tests to restrict voting to more and more conservative people.

-Gaka-,">Americans voted for progress, but our system elected regress. I disagree - the system didn't elect regression. Progress and regress are all entirely subjective.For example, I think that most gun control is mostly a regressive thing. Controlling what types of stocks and magazine limits and ammunition restrictions isn't going to stop violence or suicides or whatever ""evil"" things guns are used for. They're a tool and nothing more. If you ban guns, folks will just use the next most efficient tool... though that's dumbing down the argument by a lot.But there is an argument to be made that removing the *most* efficient option will make it less appealing (if that's the word) to commit violent crimes. It's pretty easy to rob someone with a gun, but a little harder to do with a knife. Is that enough discouragement? Is trying to keep people safe any more or less progressive than allowing them freedom to bear arms to defend themselves or to provide food?Of course, there is that whole ""right to bear arms"" thing...I also think that marijuana should be decriminalized, if not totally legalized. It's just like alcohol or caffeine or tobacco, with far fewer negative effects. For some people it even acts as a useful medical tool. Making it illegal does more harm than good. That's my ""progressive"" view.On the flip side, it can be argued that keeping marijuana illegal is a good thing for the country in that there are abuse cases. Perhaps you enjoy the feeling of being high, and so you start to smoke more of it until it's basically what you do on your downtime. (see chain smoking and those lovely alcoholics) The simple function of being high can be seen as a huge negative. When you're high or otherwise incapacitated, how does your work get impacted? Are you performing at 100%? Is trying to ensure that work gets done any more or less progressive than allowing personal freedom?It's really all relative.",0.003546634688973427,1.7354285830606386e-07,0.0002907983725890517,7.470404671039432e-05,0.0004215562075842172,1.631139821256511e-05

GideonWainright,"Also, the DEA's resources are not infinite. If Sessions raids dispensaries, then that means there are agents not focusing on hard drugs or marijuana operations in non legalized states. All the while, he's pissing off the locals who resent federal government intrusion by an Administration that failed to capture the popular vote. The important thing with legalization isn't only the dispensaries but that the state's resources are largely unavailable to the federal government, making enforcement very difficult and probably little more than symbolic. Some of the legalized operators will return to the underground and we'll have a more wild west type of market as was in California where operators largely flout the law while doing just enough of a fig leaf of legality to avoid state and local prosecution and take their chances. This could undermine the case for legalization. But, from my experience in California it actually cements the case for legalization because we want things regulated properly to get rid of the most disruptive groups or get them to settle down (i.e. the ones who engage in bad farming practices, crime, etc.). Now, we have someone to personify the argument that prohibition creates more problems then it solves -- Attorney General Sessions. Sure, the West Coast is strongly blue in the urban areas, but the states can get bluer. Especially in the rural districts where conservatism is defined by a hostility towards intrusive government. Also, they risk further alienating voters in Colorado and Nevada, which the Republicans do not want to see further erosion. Obama is making these remarks because marijuana is an excellent future wedge issue for the midterms. Plenty of conservatives, especially the libertarian-inclined, like smoking pot too or think paying 40-50k a year to incarcerate someone for smoking or selling marijuana is stupid. Lots of people who smoke pot don't vote, especially in the midterm elections. If you tell them, vote straight ticket Democrat and you'll eventually be able to access better quality weed at a lower price without fear of federal prosecution, they might show up for the midterms. Appointing Sessions as AG looks like a strategic blunder and I'm surprised it happened under Bannon's watch. Either Sessions is already reigned in (he can go after civil rights for minorities and the immigrants, but not weed) or Bannon is not nearly as clever as I think he is.",0.009242147207260132,3.2513594305783045e-07,0.0018550546374171972,6.410448986571282e-05,0.0015556514263153076,1.227229404321406e-05

Deeptrance83,"I'm very much a liberal. I thought this too. However, and hear me out, if Sessions does pick a fight against legal weed, that means he MUST go after medical weed also. Since all weed is still illegal under Federal law, he won't be able to go after pot heads in Denver without also going after cancer patients and children with ALS who use it to manage ailments.And that is why I think he'll howl and scream and demonize it but not actually do anything about it. There's also the case that Congress has already passed legislation barring Federal funds from being used to prosecute weed in states where it is legal. His only chance will be to challenge the passage of legislation before it goes into effect (most likely that would be California's new law surrounding the legalization of recreational). That would get kicked through the courts, most likely up to the Supreme Court. This would really upset a LOT of country, since a huge majority of the country is pro medical weed.

NAN,"Take a look at the Supreme Court case Gonzales v Raich where SCOTUS essentially pissed all over the constitution by saying that the federal govt somehow has the authority to regulate medical marijuana in spite of what the 9th and 10th amendments say. It's interesting. You had 4 Republican appointments supporting the federal prohibition and 3 Republican appointments saying the federal government did not have the authority. Guess where the Democrat appointments Ginsberg and Breyer stood? They sided with the prohibitionists. They genuinely believe the federal government can control every aspect of your life. Only the Republican appointments Clarence Thomas, O'Conner and Rehnquist dissented. I like Clarence Thomas's dissent.

EntropyNZ,"Doesn't matter. And you really weaken the pro-legalization argument if you try to take that route.You're talking about a fairly potent psychoactive substance that does have well recognized health risks (negative effects on neurological development if taken at younger ages, significant risk of developing/exacerbating schizophrenia, the normal health risks that come with inhaling combusted materials etc).More importantly, while the effects of being high are often desirable in social situations (whether with others or just while relaxing etc), they're equally negative in situations that carry some weight of personal responsibility (work, driving etc). The fact that the majority of consumption is via smoking means that use in public situations affects people around you, usually without their consent. The fact that passive exposure to this smoke is also psychoactive is a big deal as well.I'm pro-legalization, but if you want to be able to make a good argument for legalizing marijuana, you have to be able to show that you also recognize that there are negative aspects, and that you support legalization in a way that addresses these aspects. The model that most countries use for cigarettes and alcohol (more cigarettes, as alcohol licences are more location based) is a good model for the legalization of marijuana; particularly if you include things like not smoking within x number of meters of an entrance to a bar/restaurant, not smoking inside unless it's a private premises etc.",0.000122326600831002,4.524596253219215e-09,2.4589373424532823e-05,5.200438863539603e-06,1.4931487385183573e-05,7.258578307300922e-07

To the best of my knowledge no major party nominee has ever taken such a progressive stance on cannabis as she did, and folks are still giving her shit for not going far enough. Legal weed, just like nearly all positive progress, is going to be a journey of ""Two steps forward, one step back"" until the dam breaks. The very important thing is to keep taking those two steps forward, and not to be disheartened by taking one step back.

Magnesium18,">but the reality is weed isn't the most pressing issue nationwide and it doesn't make sense to expect any president to treat it that way.I think you need to do more research really. Would you say mass incarceration is not one of the most pressing issues? Would you say say racially biased arrests is not a pressing issue or would you say that the existing big pharma lobby and opiate pain killers are not a pressing issue? Currently due to the war on drugs, people and especially black people get arrested for possession of marijuana which is a non violent offence and can get large mandatory prison sentences. Lets also not forget how the prohibition of this substance is allowing money to go straight in the hands of drug cartels who then grow in influence only to peddle more dangerous drugs and further ruin this country when we could rather be using taxed marijuana to fund education. Marijuana which is a schedule 1 drug (really it should not be because it has medical utility) has resistance from the DEA because how else can they justify taking so much of the tax payers money (which otherwise would put many of them out of a job) when that can instead be diverted to rehab centres to make people actually better. Really it is not just a hippie movement or stoner movement trying to legalise marijuana but rather impacts and starts to address many issues progressives care about so please never call it smart again to curtail such a movement for progress simply because it saved a president from giving republicans ammunition.

I understand if you've been fortunate enough to never have experienced this type of scenario how it would be easy to assume everyone who is anti-illegal immigrant is simply racist, but in reality the presence of illegal immigrants directly affects the livelihood of many Americans. If you're an American citizen looking for manual labor jobs like landscaping or masonry in states like Texas, it's extremely difficult to find a job with a fair wage because the employers can hire illegal immigrants, skip out on payroll taxes, and spend far less on labor than if they were to hire actual citizens. So many jobs that used to pay American citizens livable wages they could support themselves with are now paying less than livable wages because the increased supply of illegal immigrant labor drives wages down.

Those that do use that argument aren't acting like their drug is harmless and attacking others. They are making the comparison because the drug that is illegal is arguably less damaging than those that are legal, begging the question of why is it illegal at all then? Also, most of your examples are anecdotal and perspective, not factual information. You're drawing unfair comparisons like comparing dabs to a glass of wine with dinner. A closer comparison would be comparing a glass of wine with dinner to a couple hits from a joint. A dab is more along the lines of drinking enough to be drunk. You claim that you never hear people talking about trying to get a buzz off their drinks, and if they did that it wasn't typical... give me a break. If you don't know that people drink to get drunk, all you need to do is step into a bar. People don't usually drink for the flavor. They drink because of how it makes them feel to varying degrees.I'm not claiming that it's healthy, and I agree that there's something to be said for addiction and dependency, but you're speaking from a place of personal bias you've developed.

NAN,"Honestly, alcohol seems far more dangerous. There are-- i'm quite sure many more people that drink alcohol in larger quantities than smoke pot in large quantities.Also, when you talk about people who smoke pot all the time all day-- MOST jobs will not allow one to be intoxicated-- whether it be on alcohol or pot.My point is--- anyone that has a job that does not allow one to be intoxicated will -for their own and others sake- not be intoxicated.Responsible adults do things in moderation, such that they are not driving or working while intoxicated---- MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BE GETTING HIGH 5-6 TIMES A DAY.That makes time-consumption of an intoxicant for an ordinary working american comparable- there are times when you are free to do it and times when you are not free to do it. If you are allowing an intoxicant to interfere with work, family, and friends, then you are in the minority and have a problem.People get addicted and need to use intoxicants in excess when they use them irresponsibly with disregard for themselves and others.Also- I STRONGLY believe that being drunk is a more debilitating state than being high, and impairs one's functions to a MUCH MORE significant degree. The intoxicant is not the problem, people that use in excess, and non-legalization resulting in incarceration of millions of americans for petty crimes is the problem.

Syliase,"So, I've actually studied this in class (or, rather, the topic of ""Why hasn't Obama passed more 'progressive'/'liberal' policies onto Congress?"") various times in pretty much all of my poli-sci classes, even the international ones, and the answers to this are about the same: y'all forget that the President's main job is to be the /executive/ branch--the most he can do is push for laws/policies to Congress, but in the end, it's Congress that makes the laws, and the President must pass it. Remember that through most of his stint as President, he has had a Republican dominated Congress who actively opposed everything he tried to push for, or anything that any Democrat pushed for. It's one of the reasons why the ACA is such a shit-show, actually, even though it's got some good bits.

He's also sticking with this line:>“Typically how these classifications are changed are not done by presidential edict,” he said, “but are done either legislatively or through the DEA.

incredibleamadeuscho,"The reality is that the country needed to move towards legalize marijuana before Obama could even signal that himself. Had he passed legalization in his first two years (or tried and failed), the shellacking he took for passing Health Care would have seemed like a pillow fight. Romney campaigned against Obama for ""Chicago style politics"". Can you imagine the dog whistling that the GOP could have done if the first black president was for legalizing pot?It's easy to forget how far we have come on the issue. California, one of the most progressive states in the country, rejected legalization by proposition in 2010 by 53.5-46.5 percent. Six years, we legalized it (starting in 2018) by 56-44 percent. That's such a big swing. It wouldnt have had support in California in 2009. It definitely wouldnt have had support in Arkansas in 2009. And he would have needed democratic senators in Arkanas, Nebraska, and Missouri in order to pass lasting change.What reality do you have to be in to think that this would have been a good idea for Obama 8 years ago?",0.00010136445052921772,4.236131445622959e-09,3.0582268664147705e-05,4.426436134963296e-06,1.6317402696586214e-05,5.828034090882284e-07

Those numbers were then extrapolated for the entire country.>I highly doubt those are the real approval numbers, more like some propaganda to make obama look good before he's out of office.Approval ratings for presidents often spike towards the end of their presidency. And these same surveys have frequently have shown low approval ratings for Obama. If they were really 'propaganda', why wouldn't they have shown his approval ratings to be very high throughout his presidency?>How were the inconsistent? Every poll said President Elect Trump was going to lose, most said by a large margin,No, the poll AGGREGATORS, models that combined all the polls into one, all said Trump would probabaly lose. Plenty of polls showed better results for Trump. LA Times had him with higher poll numbers throughout the entire election cycle. The fact that there was so much variation in the polls meant that Trump always had a chance, and Nate Silver included this chance in his model.>yet he won by a LANDSLIDE.It was a very close race, and he lost the popular vote. It was even closer than 2000.>Once you take away all the DEAD and ILLEGAL votes from hilliary, he won the popular vote by a LANDSLIDE as well.Oh, boy. Do you have any proof that this is true? There was only one documented case of fraud in the entire election, even with Trump's 'poll watchers', and it was a Trump voter.>Pollsters are not fortune tellers, you're right. But it doesn't take a fortune teller to know President Elect Trump was doing better than they were portraying him to be.This is true. That's why Nate Silver's model stands out as the best one.",0.0020099692046642303,1.7055440082458517e-07,0.0007212544442154467,3.662109884317033e-05,0.00035281426971778274,8.16827014205046e-06

NAN,"So we're just going to sit here and pretend that he didn't have two years with full control of the house and senate to repeal all the unconstitutional federal prohibitions on marijuana? If he really thought it should be treated like cigarettes and alcohol, it would have behooved him to encourage congress to bring marijuana reform laws to his desk and sign them. But that didn't happen. Between 1996 and 2013, the federal government conducted 528 dispensary raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.During Obama's first term as president, his administration oversaw 270 dispensary raids on medical marijuana dispensaries.Between 2009 and 2013, President Obama's administration spent $100 million more cracking down on medical marijuana dispensaries than George W. Bush's did.“I never made a commitment that somehow we were going to give carte blanche to large-scale producers and operators of marijuana—and the reason is because it's against federal law.” - Obama He's full of it, and he's only just now saying this so people think he is somehow pro-legalization when in reality he was not. Even though Trump's AG pick hates marijuana, Trump has implied that issues like these are not federal issues and should be left up to each state as the 10th amendment implies. It would be interesting if Trump was the president who finally nullified all the unconstitutional federal laws. I'm doubtful, but who knows. Hopefully more sensible libertarianish politicians like Rand Paul are within earshot of Trump. On a side note, I personally don't do marijuana and tend to avoid people who do, but it definitely SHOULD NOT be a federal issue. It is a state's rights issue. Marijuana is the perfect litmus test for seeing who supports the constitution and who doesn't. Any Republican who says they support the constitution, but also believes marijuana should be a federal issue is full of shit, much like the Democrats who claim to support the constitution and also hold the view that the federal government has the authority to regulate incandescent lightbulbs or firearms.",0.05113351717591286,4.6531044972653035e-06,0.017157889902591705,0.00017975183436647058,0.00594822084531188,5.206758214626461e-05

Bahmerman,"Doesn't Colorado have at least 3 or 4 years of empiracle data that proves this to be true? When they motioned to be a trial state for legalizing Marijuana they paid close attention to the effect it had on the economy and crime and traffic accidents. The sales tax generated approx. $936,682 for local municipalities according to [Colorado's Dept of Revenue](http://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/marijuana-tax-data-archive)). According to the [Drug Policy Alliance](http://www.drugpolicy.org/sites/default/files/Colorado_Marijuana_Legalization_One_Year_Status_Rport.pdf) (you can take this with a grain of salt but it checks out with Colorado's official numbers), I think to date it allowed Colorado to set aside $2.5 million to increase the number of health professionals in Colorado public schools.I can't recall the crime statistics but there was no correlation to marijuana or they had no possible way to accurately determine marijuana was the cause.As for traffic incidents, According to [Colorado's Department of Transportation](https://www.codot.gov/safety/safety-data-sources-information) they were as low as they have ever been since 2008, last I checked it was rising a little to date but still well below previous years when marijuana was illegal. I think there were some years that were lower but I don't think enough to warrant marijuana as the cause.TL;DR Colorado has years of empiracle evidence stating marijuana can in fact generate money through sales tax and poses no substantial risk to drivers.*EDIT:went to fix some links as best I could, I pulled them from a paper I did maybe a 6 months to a year ago and I guess my APA format was either botched or...whatever)*",3.834445305983536e-05,6.14819750666129e-10,9.840965503826737e-06,1.246310603164602e-06,4.639961389329983e-06,1.347126499240403e-07

WhiskeyHoliday,"I can definitely understand not wanting to get impressionable children with developing minds hooked on marijuana.I do think that many people who are pro-legalization would say that making it legal would make it harder for kids to acquire: safe, convenient, affordable, legal marijuana drives out dealers, and if marijuana were legal only for 21+, it would mean that kids would be locked out more than if they could go to their high school friend who deals. I was ""lucky"" enough to go to college in a city where I could get six-packs at 18 while looking 15 from the local bodega, but for most kids getting pot is easier right now than getting alcohol and cigarettes.The ""cool"" factor of marijuana is also enhanced a bit by being illegal, wouldn't you think? If you get it from a drug store and a surly middle-aged-woman puts it in a Thanks For Shopping With Us bag under the harsh flourescent light, it's just another mood-alterant they bought with their six-pack and sponges and toilet paper.Additionally, if they're getting it from their dealer, it *might* end up being the kind of gateway drug the government warned us about back in the day for some kids, if their dealer is also holding stronger drugs. Maybe some of those kid dealers end up in situations over their heads when they buy from larger, more nefarious suppliers. If we save some of *those* kids, maybe it's worth the risk as well.It seems to boil down for me that if kids want it badly enough, they're going to get it, but we can at least regulate it, normalize it, tax it, ensure that it's a high-quality product and make the experience safer for everyone.

_Someone_Who_Is_Me_,"Gotta say, I thought I was in r/trees reading all of these posts in favor of legalization. Even with Reddit having a majority of liberal commenters it still warms my weedy heart to see so many people wanting this to happen. We need to get our fellow humans out of prison for doing things that cause no one harm, and we need to be able to study the medicinal benefits of not just cannabis but of all psychoactive substances (looking at you, psilocybin). There are observable negative effects to any substance at high enough doses but with proper research and understanding comes informed dosage control, which is really what people need for these substances. I doubt Obama will make this change, this is far from the only time he's mentioned weed in his presidency. I lost a lot of faith in him when he addressed the sandy hook shooting by saying the US's shooting fatalities were the worst of any nation for that year when in reality after seeing the statistics myself they were substantially lower than multiple countries including Norway and Germany. If he does this, I believe he'll save a lot of innocent lives especially of the minority citizens he claims to care about so much. Taking weed away from the arrestible offences will in some way make it harder to target minorities for minor things that white people do just as often if not more. Trump cares about public image, he won't take weed away if he's thrust into a nation whose economy and job market just got a huge figurative stimulus package from the cannabis industry. People need jobs and people will pay out their ass for weed.

I'm not saying that there aren't successful, driven people who smoke pot out there, but this just seems like it's too common of an occurrence to just mark it off as not harmful or addicting to someone's lifestyle.

Bongoalot,"I'm surprised to see so many people hating on Obama for this. Partly because reddit has shown it's liberal bias.There are multiple reasons I can think of why Obama didn't act on this early in office. He is the first black president of the US, it would probably feed racist stereotypes if he had acted or was as vocal about this early in office.I personally don't believe the president role is what the majority of the public thinks it is. Of course this is only my belief, of course I don't actually know but it's what I've personally deduced from observing our political system. So read on with taking what I've typed with a grain of salt.I do believe the president role is mostly a puppet. When the presidential candidate wins and is debriefed, etc. they are probably handed an incredibly overwhelming amount of information that is not known to the public, and it takes a long time before they adjust. Think about when you get a new job and the time it can take to adjust to something very different than anything you've ever done before. Imagine all the classified information you might be given, and it might take a long list of classified history to read through to understand why things are the way they are now.Meanwhile the president role has obligations to fulfill in existing operations/initiatives made long before the president has been put into office and probably has limited if any authority to subvert those operations/initiatives. Also, the president has obligations to fulfill the wishes of it's contributors, supporters, and anyone else in bed with the electoral college, or any of the people you see (and a large portion you never see) in the media who endorsed that presidential candidate.When you or anyone else praises a politician (which always furrows my brow when i hear or read), they probably don't realize that there is an entire organization of people behind each politician who's purpose is to ensure that the politician gets summarized information regarding every topic that the politician may be faced with in their line of work. The president probably has to cover more than most politicians, so they are probably getting handed an immense amount of information coming from all across the globe every day. Can one person actually do all that? Probably not. So a lot of what a president is doing, saying and acting on has probably been thoroughly analyzed and filtered through multiple people's hands before it ever reaches to the actual act of that politician talking about the subject. So when you hear speeches from president Obama, please keep in mind you are likely hearing not Obama's words, but a collaborative adulterated version of what Obama or his organization has come up with. And of course he is the one actually speaking, so he has the final say.Believing that...it is very easy for me to see why Obama waited until now to speak out on this, he probably has diminished responsibility, his obligations have been uplifted, and those people who have been collaborating with him to make sure he serves America correctly have found new jobs or are preparing to work for Trump.I may be wrong on all of this, but at least i'm thinking for myself.",0.00011307490058243275,2.734634740875208e-09,2.1516338165383786e-05,3.676758296933258e-06,1.4934948012523819e-05,4.93571405968396e-07

I also want to turn your attention to this: [A Center of Juvenile and Criminal Justice report on who is most likely to be killed by police.](http://www.cjcj.org/news/8113) It shows that black men ages 15-44 are all at least roughly 2.5 times as likely as the average man (regardless of race) to be killed by police.

And while it might not be a police-specific systematic issue, it is a sign of an issue that is somewhat systematic in nature throughout the United States, and that is there are a not-insignificant number of people who, at least act like black lives matter less than white lives. I am not a fan of vilifying police as a group, but I think we should be vilifying the police who shot Michael Brown, the police who killed Eric Garner, the police who killed Samuel DuBose, the police who killed Brendon Glenn, the police who killed Freddy Gray, and the police who killed Walter Scott, as a start.

ZippyTheChicken,only problem is marijuana is different than alcohol or cigarettes.. there is over regulation of cigarettes.. the cost of a carton/10packs/200cigarettes is now about $75 and the actual cost to produce and sell it is only about $10.. No one gets high off of cigarettes and contrary to popular understanding MALPRACTICE is now the #3 Killer in the USA and that needs to be addressed because Doctors are not losing their licensesAlcohol on the other hand you can die from within hours but it is strong enough that you will passout from it at some point.Marijuana.. you can basically smoke from the time you get up until the time you go to sleep and unlike alcohol it has a different but just as strong effect on you.If you don't believe these things you are either lying or you have no experience.. The fact is Marijuana is a hard drug .. as hard or worse than Alcohol and it can ruin your life just like being an alcoholic will do.. Very VERY VERY few people can use marijuana for years but only use it on the weekends .. most people get mentally addicted and it will cause them to smoke every day.. their money goes to this.. money they shouldn't be spending and other parts of their lives suffer..You can not be 100% productive if you are stoned.. have a light buzz.. or even are feeling the mild effects a few hours later.. you just can't be 100% no matter how hard you try...And thats not good.. illegal? i don't know....But I do know.. most people that smoke pot are not responsible about the way they do it... not like they pretend they are...I can guarantee every person that has smoked for longer than 3 years who is an adult has done something they shouldn't have done. .. They drove stoned.. or buzzed.. they went to work stoned or buzzed.. they put other people at risk because they smoke weed and forgot what time it is and they got to get to work because this time.. this time they are getting fired for sure... and then they drive down the highway paranoid looking as hard as they can .. trying to stay away from others.. but its impossible.. they put others at risk.. And I am old enough to know this.. and I can honestly say I have NEVER ONCE MET ONE PERSON THAT HASN'T RISKED SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BECAUSE THEY WERE STONED.... Vote me down I expect it.. But only do it if what I am saying is TRULY A LIE.. because its notShould it be illegal ? i don't knowwill it be used responsibly by most or all if it is?.. no chance in hell,0.11049624532461166,1.2684792636719067e-05,0.017833564430475235,0.0006268767174333334,0.012357219122350216,0.00020939495880156755

Bocaj1000,"Those examples don't use chemicals to alter the state of your mind. They actually allow your brain to stimulate you instead. There's a difference. Not many people seem to have stances on drugs outside of basic health issues.I've had to think about my stance on drugs for a long time. I've analyzed many aspects. For one, any drug with medicinal properties should be allowed medicinally, hands down. My other stance is that recreational drugs need to be fazed out of our culture. They have never offered any benefit to our society. Health-wise, they **change** you. With hard drugs, alcohol, and tobacco, it's pretty obvious. We're taught the health effects. With marijuana, it's slightly different. Marijuana is slightly harmful, but it mentally changes you. You become dependent on it (Not biologically addicted to it, but psychologically addicted). You start to vote for less drug restrictions, which subliminally allows more people to be brought into a drug world. You might not believe it, but this stuff actually happens and does affect others. Moral-wise, drugs allow you to falsely escape from the real-world. It's like cheating on a test. We need to teach ourselves, especially in this restricting society, how to become happy without the need for illegal substances and mind-altering chemicals. It will pay off in the long run (For you, and for generations down the line).Think of it as Adam and Eve in the Biblical story. Adam and Even were allowed to do anything, as long as they did not eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. It was a test, presented to them by their god. Mentally rejecting drugs is the test that good culture places on you. You can do it, and there may not be extreme consequences, but you failed in the eyes of good culture. Ignore drugs, and you pass the test. You will be a better person because of it.",0.011702838353812695,1.990290911635384e-06,0.001151753356680274,0.0003237684431951493,0.0014350550482049584,8.857683860696852e-05

There will never be a time when you tell people ""you can't do this"" and there won't be a sizable amount of people who will be *more* encouraged to do it. Absolutely drugs alter you. That's the point of drugs. But many other things alter us in negative ways too, chemically or not, but we don't discuss them. Furthermore, there's very little evidence that suggests that legalizing something makes its use spike long-term. Often it's the exact opposite - legalize something and it sheds the riskiness of it and is less appealing to many people.
