dxp4b1p,natha105,"Would you describe yourself as a politically exposed person? Do you have trade secret information? Do you work for a defense contractor? Do you talk shit about china online and then travel through china (even for the purpose of making a connection), or live close to China (such as Hong Kong)? Do you have relatives or contacts who fit any of these definitions? If no - then I wouldn't worry about it. If yes, then I would try and return the phone."
dxpi99t,LjLies,"Whatever does that have to do with being worried about one's ZTE phone and whether it will keep receiving support?This ban against ZTE is in place because they are accused by the US of selling components to countries under sanctions (namely, Iran).It has *absolutely nothing* to do with how your ZTE phone may interact with your ""secrets"". The problem is that since this ban forbids US companies from selling anything to ZTE, and ZTE phones use a lot of US-made technology, then ZTE may not be able to honor warranties, and they may not even be able to continue licensing the software on then (i.e. the Google proprietary ecosystem on top of AOSP, which is also a US technology)."
dxq5dzr,thirdstreetzero,What if I don't think facts are real tho
dxp4ukh,claytonmation,"I'm pretty sure I can say ""no"" to all of those."
dxp6seo,RationalLies,"I would sincerely hope that defense contractors with state secrets aren't buying trap phones from their Walmart.Unless it's hood defense we're talking about. In which case, I sincerely hope hood defense foot soldiers are buying trap phones from their local Walmart."
dxp7xk8,90s_conan,"When you say hood defense foot soldiers, are you refering to your classic ""hood"" foot soldier you'd find infront of your local bodega?"
dxpd827,goslowejustmet,No you're thinking of The Wire. He's talking about ninjas. You know them by the footprint on their hoods.
dxpdn25,SlammingPussy420,I know 4 painters that run a foot soldier removal service.
dxpejjg,2high2care2make1,That's funny. I know 4 turtles (crazy I know) that also run a foot soldier removal service. Who are these painters?
dxpfuoy,Username_000001,No way! I know a guy who runs a group of foot soldiers with an awesome shredded turtle recipe. He never seems to actually get a hold of the raw ingredients though.
dxpj2ie,OrlandoArtGuy,I know a guy that has feet
dxpqqil,OldDirtyBuzzard,I don't know why I like this comment so much. It speaks to me though.
dxq4w26,negnancypants,I have a friend who works in defense and his company supplied him with one of their phones. He works on some highly secure sites using the phone for data transfers.
dxp58bl,StrangeDrivenAxMan,Me too!
dxppl8a,deltabay17,"Do you care that the chinese government uses the profits from its stolen technology sold to you to occupy Tibet and culturally cleanse their Tibetan culture, forcing them to speak mandarin only, forcing them to have their names in mandarin, and forcing Han Chinese culture on them? Do you care about the same happening in Xinjiang along with the thousands of innocent people recently detained for no reason or trial? How about the 24million free people of Taiwan who suffer through weekly threats of invasion from China who currently has 1300 missiles pointed at them? They pulled themselves out of a murderous dictatorship to become the strongest democracy in Asia and they do not want to return to dictatorship, have their freedoms taken away and suffer countless casualties from a Chinese invasion. If no \- then I wouldn't worry about it. If yes, then I would try and return the phone."
dxq19qg,clowergen,Geez.That's too many facts about foreign countries for an American.
dxpsg63,TrumpwonHilDawgLost,Meh
dxqbljh,RobotJonboy,"Aren't all the phones made in China though? I get that zte is a Chinese company, while Samsung and Apple at not, but how much of a difference does it make when the other phones are made in China too?"
dxqbof9,deltabay17,"This is what I replied to someone else who said the same thing:> Well that's where they're assembled. That's it. They fly the parts in and pay Chinese workers $2 an hour to glue them together. Very few of the parts are made in China. A lot of the parts are made in Taiwan, Korea, Japan even the US. A phone made by a foreign company compared to a Chinese company phone like ZTE is not going to be the same quality just because they glue the parts together in a certain geographical location. Standard and business practices in China are still very poor."
dxqcy25,JagerBaBomb,"And yet my ZTE's have been some of the hardiest phones I've ever seen. So, uh."
dxqrdmt,LjLies,"And yet my ""Chinese"" ZTE Axon 7 is made with the same Qualcomm chipset that is in many ""Western"" flagship phones, too, and the rest of the component are also largely not ""Chinese"".So again the actual difference compared to what you say...?"
dxq3vrg,wesharrisb,Reliously lead theocracies that engage in slavery get no choices once they are conquered.
dxq2r7u,coolspot18,"China has been in Tibet for hundreds of years and was a Tributary or even Vassal since the Ming Dynasty... Anyways, the Americans wiped out the Indians and put them onto reservations, so America isn't one to preach about cultural domination."
dxq2vde,deltabay17,"Im not American and I'm not 'preaching' as an American about cultural domination. I am talking from the perspective of the marginalised Tibetans, who were invaded in 1950 and have been occupied since.Anyway, whataboutism is weak. You can always find someone else whos done the same or similar thing. I don't see how it makes it ok."
dxq37ez,coolspot18,"The point is that Tibet has always been a tributary or even under the direct control of Chinese for centuries. It was under the control of the [Yuan Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_under_Yuan_rule) (Mongols) and subsequently during the Ming Dynasty.The Chinese withdrew from Tibet in 1912, but never rescinded it's claim over the country, so in 1950, it re-entered and re-asserted control over the region.To the Chinese, Tibet is like Hawaii, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, or one of the other non-Mainland US holdings."
dxq38hm,deltabay17,"That's just a very sinocentric opinion that Tibetans and most non Han Chinese don't not agree with. Besides your claim that China is entitled to Tibet's land and resources, you are ignoring how Tibetan people and their culture are actually mistreated."
dxqc190,MeatyMutaWings,"They're not.Tibet is booming in every way and has been doing better than ever before.You can blindly take in separatist propaganda, or you can take a trip there to see how it really is. The minorities in China are subject to many more priveleges than the Han Chinese."
dxqc3f7,deltabay17,Privileges?!?!?! Wow. I have been there by the way. I lived and worked in China and I speak mandarin. You are simply lying.
dxqcara,MeatyMutaWings,"那很好，如果你去过西藏，那我请问你见到的是什么？是不断现代化迅速发展的城区还是如你所说的，武警逼迫人们学中文？少数民族前些年不但不受到一个孩子限制，而且入学条件比汉族也都有优势。你在中国呆过不了解这些的话也是醉了。But of course you're far more likely to be a 12 year old who's never been anywhere but your mom's basement, w/e worth a try."
dxqchia,deltabay17,Thats very funny and clever. Obviously you are a mainland Communist Party nationalist. I could tell you in all the ways the Tibetan's are oppressed but I won't because all you need to do is google it. I'm not sure whether you have access to Google or free information though outside of the Party's propaganda. Or do they allow free access for 五毛狗？
dxqcj8v,MeatyMutaWings,"There it is boys, basement child pretending he has seen or know things.Have fun trolling on the internet!"
dxq5pdf,xaclewtunu,Nobody alive today had anything to do with wiping out Indians. We're all free to preach about any effing thing we choose.
dxph8d0,theyetisc2,Do you want the chinese government (and whomever they give/sell access to) to have full access to your phone?That's the only question that matters.
dxqdo9f,yngwieromeo,I trust them way more than I trust Trump and his pals.
dxpknt1,obsessedcrf,"You say it like the American government doesn't access American phones. I'm more worried about domestic powers than foreign powers, personally"
dxpsqo1,N0V0w3ls,You act like they aren't looking at your Chinese phone too.
dxpyedd,claytonmation,"The US already has basically full access through covert programs that sweep up massive amounts of data. And my data is likely already being traded around by various companies thanks to all the stupid apps I download. I don't plan on going to China any time soon, why give a shit?"
dxpnnzp,Ellen_Pao_is_shit,I don't live in China so why should I care?
dxqnisp,Geminii27,"This is your captain speaking. Due to weather, we have been diverted to Beijing. Some of you may be allowed to reboard."
dxpjlet,SmugglingPineapples,"Yeah, okay, but *are* you a spy? And *why* are you pretending you're not?"
dxp923o,StillUsesWindowsXP,"No one is accusing ZTE of spying on users, you're thinking of Huawei. ZTE was caught violating an agreement it made with the US government."
dxpqgnn,Timeforadrinkorthree,OnePlus too
dxpy8tk,dWaldizzle,What about oneplus? That's what I have.
dxq5soc,Timeforadrinkorthree,A quick google will help you (I'm out at the moment). Doggy stuff was found on the OnePlus.

dxpycqh,Mr-Howl,Oh god I hope not. I love my OnePlus.
dxpjmdc,St_Bernardus,They're a Chinese company. They just haven't gotten caught yet.
dxpm5l8,StillUsesWindowsXP,There are probably far more American companies collecting data about you than Chinese ones.
dxpv1oz,SugarInMyMeatPi,Yeah but not on behalf of the government. All Chinese companies are under he control of the Chinese Communist Party which literally runs and owns the government in China sooooooo....Edit: guess I struck a never huh 🤷🏿‍♂️ I hope I'm not on a CCP watch list. I'd love to visit the Guangdong Province!
dxq1az7,TwinParatrooper,Shouldn't use Lenovo laptops then including Thinkpads. China of course have nothing better to do than listen into Grandparents and Mum's making calls on their Walmart bought phone.
dxp6p1a,3percentinvisible,What has that got to do with not installing google apps?
dxp8msx,ost2life,The reason the export ban exists?
dxpb310,Runnerphone,Are exporting network gear to Iran and Syria despite a embargo on such things...after having been fined for it before. They likely thought they would just be fined again so now they can not use us sourced parts or software and as they use us designed SOCs and Android is a blow for them big time.Edit it's not a ban on the phones the export ban is on selling network and comm gear to Iran and Syria. The restrictions on the phone basically screws them world wide outside china.
dxpcd68,3percentinvisible,"The export ban is against selling to iran, and zte did. They now can't be sold or licensed specific USAian tech.So why would you be worried about having bought a zte phone, or that its got anything to do with spying?"

dxpo3i5,natha105,All the google products are available as online tools. So long as you have a browser you can use your google apps.
dxpvbhu,LjLies,"When people say ""the Google apps"" or ""the GApps"", they don't just mean the individual apps like YouTube, etc, but more importantly, the proprietary Google framework (the most visible part of which being known as the [Google Play Services](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&hl=en_US) to users of the store, or as [Google Mobile Services](https://www.android.com/gms/) to manufacturers) that those applications, as well as a very large number of third-party applications on Play, and the Play Store itself, use for much of their functionality.This framework is only [licensed by Google to manufacturers of certified devices](https://source.android.com/compatibility/#licensing-gms).*Right now*, [ZTE is one of Google's certified partners](https://www.android.com/certified/partners/), but presumably, this cannot continue under this ruling."
dxpyehv,Mr-Howl,"So that means that ZTE, which makes android devices, is essentially fucked? Just trying to gather info here."
dxqeypu,LjLies,"No, because their primary market is China, where Android phones typically *don't* have this Google framework on them at all (last I checked Google was still soft-banned from operating those services there, though there was change in the air).So it will likely be a huge hit for ZTE, perhaps more so due to the loss of Qualcomm chips they use in their high-end phones than due to Google, and it may easily mean they'll cease operating in the West in some capacity (although there are tricks they might employ now, like creating a ""completely unrelated"" non-subsidiary company), but they aren't completely *fucked* because their huge primary markets in Asia are still there.^Typoedits"
dxqfe8d,Mr-Howl,"Ah, gotcha. I was mainly wondering because my in-laws use ZTE phones and wasn't sure if they are going to end up with paperweights or not. I feel like that creation of another company could happen though if they really are hit that hard."
dxqj2ew,LjLies,"Keep in mind that even if Google just revokes their license for *existing* ZTE devices to use the Google services (which would be a pretty bold thing to do, even if the ruling seemed to technically require it, so while it might happen, it's far from an established fact), it is very possible to use a phone in meaningful ways (""smart"" ways, not just to call people) even without those Google services available.I use three Android devices that way myself, and although in my case it's a deliberate choice and so your in-laws would easily not be as comfortable as me with that if it were imposed on them (in other words, chances are they would be pretty pissed off), the fact remains the phones will still be usable in many ways."
dxp68ye,DennisQuaaludes,BRB reactivating muh Facebooks.
dxp621u,Acysbib,"I uncovered some latent ZTE malware on my Pro Duo. Some weird app installed itself 16 days (note 1 day after I could return it to walmart) called ""Ume Browser - Latest News""It installed itself. No permission asked. It was auto gratnted every single permission I could think of. It was incapable of being deleted (google play did not see it nor would my ES file explorer find it) i spread the word everywhere I could. It was not until 2 weeks later AVG (God bless those folks...) Managed to disable the app, even if they could not delete it.ZTE is chinese spy gadgets that you do not get to play with the cool toys... No, they just siphon your data."
dxp6ycm,xSxHxAxRxPx,sounds like it came from another source. oem spyware doesn't need to even be visible to the user. ES file explorer is actually owned by a chinese company and is itself a huge risk. now you know.
dxp7jej,Snazzy_Serval,I got rid of ES file explorer long ago. It used to be a simple program than got bloated.
dxpg0da,jxjftw,"So sad too, was great back then."
dxpicwz,cherryreddit,What are the best alternatives?
dxpiq04,Zeitspieler,I use FX file explorer.
dxpxg6z,rehashed_salt,+1. You can never go wrong with FOSS.
dxpxlmt,catzruul,Amaze is another good one. It's on fdroid.
dxpjxnp,JerrathBestMMO,X-plore. It has dual tabs. Makes it closer to an actual computer file explorer

dxpd1sm,thepeck,When was ezexplorer sold? I keep an old backup that I use and don't allow it to update
dxpktxw,obsessedcrf,I got rid of it because it had WAY too many ads now. I use FX File explorer now
dxp74my,Acysbib,"Pretty sure it was trying to be visible on purpose. To get you to use it, and thus more data siphon from the things you do through it.But, yes, been keeping an eye on ES for a while. Haven't used it in forever, but I have not yet see any malicious data flowing from it."
dxpqz57,lolzfeminism,"As the other guy said, OEM spyware doesn't need you to use it, the spyware can be baked into the operating system, the bootloader, the hardware etc. This gives it full control over all applications that are both invisible and impossible to uninstall/remove.

dxq5hgi,bronwater,"No worries mate most enodeb (telephone cells) are of ZTE or Huawei. They are ""not"" spying on other phone traffic too.People should understand if they don't want to lose their privacy that they must not buy a smartphone, computer even fricking fridges nowadays. Wether it is the manufacuterer of the cell chip, cpu, nfc there is always one party that is shady is fuck and want as much possible data of you.The more connected it is the less your privacy is.

dxpheqf,ComingSouth,Are these the only two manufacturers that I need to worry about? I'm looking to buy a budget phone and some of these Chinese manufacturers look sketchy are hell.
dxpzrjo,kurtthewurt,"I'd recommend a Motorola G5. You can get one at Costco for less than $180 off-contract, unlocked. Definitely the best bang for your buck budget smartphone."
dxpih6u,LjLies,"No, as far as actually sketchiness, those two (and Xiaomi) are the ones you by and large do *not* have to worry about."
dxpkrrt,JohnEdwa,"And if you buy any phone from china, always re-install the ROM when you get the phone. Many vendors swap in their own ROM, with who-knows-what added in.For Xiaomi, using the xiaomi.eu ROM is preferred."
dxplbny,LjLies,"I do that when I buy a phone from *anywhere*, because I'm not so deluded as to think only Chinese companies incorporate spyware, and other countries' companies don't.What is preferred, for me, is a fully free and open source operating system, to the extent I find it practical. Hence I use [LineageOS for microG](https://lineage.microg.org/) specifically, and source the vast majority of my apps from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). I would use [Replicant](http://replicant.us/) if I found that practical, but unfortunately, I can't say I do, given all the proprietary bits that are required to run important hardware in virtually *all* phones currently on the market.Not *many*, by the way, but *all* vendors have their own ROMs: there simply isn't a ""standard"" Android ROM, as the [Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/) by Google is not a pre-built ROM but a set of source code files, that phone vendors are *expected* to configure, customize, and build, specifically for their devices, with different end results in all sorts of terms. Of course this doesn't *have* to mean they will install ""who-knows-what"" as opposed to installing ""we-do-know-what"", but I'm simply saying there is no concept of ""swapping an own ROM"", because there is no standard, reference ROM in the first place."
dxq4gjy,GodOfPlutonium,"Actually there IS now, since from android 8.0 onward all oems are required to implement treble , which can boot generic system images, and booting an aosp gsi is part of the Google cts certification process now"
dxqebr1,LjLies,"I didn't realize Treble went that far. That is a pretty great thing honestly, short of just having fully open source device trees.Would this literally mean that any custom ROM made with Treble in mind should, by definition, work on *every* Treble device?^Typoedits"
dxqroxa,GodOfPlutonium,"the HAL is still versioned , but yes , [thats basically how it works](https://www.xda-developers.com/flash-generic-system-image-project-treble-device/)"
dxqrrio,LjLies,"Cool. Well, good thing that the already scant chances of ZTE adding a Treble partition to my Axon 7 with the Oreo upgrade are quickly turning into smoke thanks to omgtheyselltoIran, as the Oreo update may simply not even happen anymore, for a start."
dxqrxlx,GodOfPlutonium,"i should have clairfed, android OEMS are required to implement treble on any handset that ships with oreo first, they can update to oreo without using treble though"
dxqs2cr,LjLies,"Yeah, it says that in your link anyway. At this point, the official Oreo release for the Axon 7 is in private beta, so people are under NDA, and while I'm sure people already know unofficially, I honestly haven't researched whether it seems likely that it will use Treble.The answer was probably going to be ""no"" all along, but I'm just saying, now it is no longer so certain they will be able to *release* the update to Oreo at all on western markets, with or without Treble."
dxpm52g,JohnEdwa,"Ah, I didn't mean vendor as is Xiaomi, I mean vendor as in GearBest or Banggood or whatever AliExpress seller you get the phone from. [They tend to flash their own version to add in advertisements and such.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/wiki/roms/reseller) I guess the 'official' term is a ""reseller ROM"", but everyone keeps calling them vendor ROMs instead.But yeah, I've run a custom AOSP based ROMs on all of my phones - currently ResurrectionRemix on my Xiaomi Redmi 4 Prime."
dxpmu17,LjLies,"Well, but if the reseller flashes their own thing, then that will immediately be spotted by the user (at least if the user reads, anyway), because the bootloader will know it's not booting a firmware signed by the manufacturer, and so, when the phone is turned on, it will show the user a warning screen similar to [this one](https://framapic.org/A10XTZS88vmg/ExW8N7HQnPxu).Bootloader warnings on other phones can [look even more conspicuous, but in any case they all have to be displayed for at least 5 seconds](https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot#user_experience) to receive Google certification.This particular picture is of my own ZTE Axon 7 powering on — and of course, in my case, the reason it's showing this screen is not because a *seller* messed with the ROM, but because *I* installed LineageOS... The phone itself was sold and fulfilled by Amazon EU, so from that point of view, it was reasonably safe to begin with."
dxpnjzs,JohnEdwa,"Not on a Xiaomi phone - a vendor will use EDL mode to flash their ROM as it bypasses requiring unlocking the bootloader, and the phone thinks it's the official ROM. If it was that easy to spot they wouldn't need [these long-ass posts on their official forum](http://en.miui.com/thread-392159-1-1.html). I know, mine came with one.Why this is possible to do with Xiaomi phones (and probably others as EDL mode is a feature in the Qualcomm SOC), I really don't know, but it's absolutely ridiculous."
dxpnu9k,LjLies,"If you do end up with a phone like that, though, you should also make sure you replace the *bootloader*, and not just the main Android ROM, with a known-good version, because then the bootloader itself may have been compromised... either with something that simply ""forgets"" to display the warning screen, or in theory, with something more dangerous than that."
dxpmwvb,zdakat,"I would love to be able to swap out android on any device,but some devices have drivers you can't get. Which pretty much leaves you stuck with the manufacturer's rom. In theory it should be that simple to do."

Not any manufacturer will get my money, but the choice is definitely more swayed by things like whether the manufacturer releases their Linux sources in a timely fashion as the license requires (facilitating custom ROMs), than by whether the company is headquartered in China, America, Europe or elsewhere.Unfortunately, ZTE's open source release site [seems to be non-operational right now](http://opensource.ztedevice.com/), but I suspect that may indeed have to do with the resent developments, as they did release source before and even [gave LineageOS developers drivers for newer releases in advance](https://www.xda-developers.com/zte-axon-7-lineageos-15/) to facilitate custom ROM development."
dxpeuji,Ohyeahwellurapoohead,"No. Android is open source and the U.S. can't prevent ZTE from using it, and nothing prevents you from just downloading the Google ecosystem on your own (but you don't need to do that since you already have it on your phone)."
dxpiq71,LjLies,"The ""Google ecosystem"" itself prevents it, if Google flicks that particular switch for a given phone model. Just because you can download it doesn't mean it will necessarily agree to *run*, nevermind exchange data with Google servers, if Google doesn't want it to."
dxpevaf,mightyarrow,Xda is your friend.
dxpyfi7,claytonmation,What is that?
dxqrvyx,IM_ZERO_COOL,XDA-Developers. It's an android ROM developing community.
dxp4h65,Feelin_Arkansaucey,"Yes, but only because you bought a ZTE phone."
dxphove,jomontage,Had one for 3 years. Nothing wrong with them besides cameras aren't amazing but I'm not gonna pay an extra $400 for a good camera
dxpsqqj,MissippiMudPie,Love my zte grand max pro with it's 5 day battery life!
dxqdce6,JagerBaBomb,Seriously. They're damn good phones. This wouldn't even be a thing right now if they weren't.
dxpbugt,miikeb,"Yes, definitely. Your Google Maps, Assistant etc etc may soon stop working as Google will be forced to not allow their services to be used on ZTE devices. It isn't clear from the article if this will definitely be a problem, but one of the main points of the article is that Google can no longer offer these services for Android on ZTE devices. Unsure if it is only new phones or what though."
dxpksab,obsessedcrf,"I seriously doubt Google would discontinue service to to those which it is already installed. That would piss off a lot of people. Not to mention, XDA or another modding community would be scramble to making a work around"
dxplbjl,miikeb,"They don't get a choice, that is how sanctions work. Google must comply as a US company."
dxplxpx,obsessedcrf,Not licensing GAPPs to be shipped is not the same as discontinuing service to existing devices
dxpzmif,gjsmo,Sanctions are not retroactive. You don't have return exports from prior to the sanctions.
dxqec4b,Kepabar,"Right, but services are ongoing. If you have a ZTE device and used Google maps in the past, that doesn't mean you are guaranteed to be able to use it forever in the future."
dxpiwll,FredTheLynx,"Just because google is not allowed to liscense them to ZTE does not mean these apps, which are free to download on the internet, cannot be installed by users using ZTE hardware."

dxplabd,miikeb,"Maybe sideloaded but the Play Store is a service. It's in the article.""being locked out of the Play Store would devastate ZTE's smartphones worldwide."""
dxpqkje,Bendable-Fabrics,"The Play Store is a database. And there are mirrors outside of the US, so there's no ""export"" involved."
dxpqo16,miikeb,"I'm sure a database handles the credit card transactions and user authentication too. Also, the location of the data is not relevant, this is not tarrifs."
dxplosh,crispylagoon,The play store service is added to kindle fire tablets though?
dxpo6ao,sanriver12,maps works without google services in my tablet.
dxp7fcv,xSxHxAxRxPx,"No, the sheer administrative and financial cost for american companies to dump their ZTE stock (including GSM equipment in cell towers) and completely change any of their software in existing products means this will apply to future products. The only thing that could degrade your phone now is if the google apps are removed, but that would be only a speed bump because you could add them yourself. And to even have the google apps removed, it would require google and all the mobile networks to work together to update the android version to have their os remove the apps."
dxpilx4,LjLies,"No, they wouldn't really have to literally get the OS to upgrade itself and remove the GApps in the process. The GApps phone home all the time, and as of late, [they actively refuse to run if your phone doesn't pass the SafetyNet test](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/27/google-confirms-blocking-google-apps-uncertified-android-devices-heres-deal/) for full certification. There is no need to update anything, as Google Play and the Google Service Framework already have all the machinery in place to selectively deny service if Google decides to."

dxq327b,German_Camry,I don't think so
dxqaig5,snackarydaquiri,Maybe don't tell people you shop at Walmart.
dxqdw5s,iamcytrox,"Nah observe the news. In case you like the phone and you're happy with it, keep it. I guess in a few weeks there will be gapps (open source pack with all Google Apps and services) available. The XDA forum is quite fast. You just need to root it and install them. Okay.. you have to read into it and your warrenty voids.. I just want to say that there are always ways to customize it. But if you arent into this kind of technology stuff you should return it.."
dxqe4aj,beercancarl,Yes but not because of this article 😂
dxqgdtv,dextroz,If I were you - I would return it - a 20% restocking fee (if applicable) is lower than losing all the money when ZTE disbands its entire retail mobile device customer support system in a few months.
dxqhrww,combatmonk,Return it.
dxp7mbd,donuts96,I worked at Walmart. You got 14 days before you can't return it
dxqak2v,snackarydaquiri,"I think you meant to say, You have 14 days to return it."
dxp8i6r,chrome6419,Nah just side load apps or tell your friends to backup apps and email/dropbox the .apk files.
dxphl9g,pixie_ryn,Not even. You can install F-Droid then install the Yalp Store app
dxprptl,Mitchiro,"To piggyback, I bought a ZTE watch from TMobile a few months ago. Should I be worried?"
dxp6i14,TheBurtReynold,No - Walmart is recognized as a premium provider w/ high-class customers. You'll be fine.
dxpmmnw,AbrasiveLore,"No. You really don't want Google apps installed on your phone at all. Android is fine, but Google Play Services is spyware. Then again, ZTE might have included spyware of it's own at a lower level :)."
dxpry7t,Trumpfreeaccount,What lol?
dxpkgj4,Xharos,There'll be no support. Return it.
dxppc86,deltabay17,thats what u get for buying chinese trash spyware
dxpy9hn,claytonmation,I thought basically every phone is made in China or around there in some kind of nightmarish factory with suicide nets or something.
dxpyczo,deltabay17,"Well that's where they're assembled. That's it. They fly the parts in and pay Chinese workers $2 an hour to glue them together. Very few of the parts are made in China. A lot of the parts are made in Taiwan, Korea, Japan even the US. A phone made by a foreign company compared to a Chinese company phone like ZTE is not going to be the same quality just because they glue the parts together in a certain geographical location. Standard and business practices in China are still very poor."
dxpq7s3,crazyshadowdog,Maybe you should be worried
dxpqi9k,seeking-n-knowing,There are plenty of cheap phones out there. Return it and get something else
dxpy2vd,JustBeanThings,"You did buy a ZTE, so yeah, probably."
dxq1i27,Dudeidkandidc,I mean. They are PRETTY garbage. I'd take it back regardless.
dxqhscu,claytonmation,"I bought it BECAUSE it's cheap crap. I broke two $300+ phones in less than a year. Didn't buy warranties or anything, but I did get cases to protect them. Those broke first, followed by the phones themselves. I said fuck it and got this for like $30."
dxq8gk4,lurks-too-much,I bought a ZTE and roughly 1 year later it had no room on it to fit its own updates.It just kept prompting me to update all the apps it forced me to install...Piece of shit phone.
dxpe23t,AFAIKIDCAM,">ZTE was caught violating US sanctions by illegally shipping telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea. The company then made things worse by ""making false statements and obstructing justice, including through preventing disclosure to and affirmatively misleading the US Government,"" according to the Department of Commerce. The company reached a settlement with the government, agreeing to pay up to $1.2 billion in penalties and discipline the employees involved in the sale.>Recently, the Commerce Department found ZTE was not complying with this settlement, which triggered the next part of the agreement: a seven-year ban on US exports to ZTE. The company is no longer allowed to use US components and, possibly, software in its devices.Seems fair tbh"
dxpgshd,rockyrainy,"Sounds like ZTE forgot to go Alphabet. They should transfer ZTE shares to ZTE holdings. Then split ZTE into ZTE China, ZTE-we-sell-to-western-democracies llc. and Totally-NOT-ZTE-4-Iran-and-NK Ltd."
dxpq7mn,droans,They did. And they got caught doing it.
dxpqjtl,CarlosFer2201,"Serves them well, with those crappy names it was so obvious what they were doing"
dxpxtir,here-to-jerk-off,"This or something else?> # [ZTE USA Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE#ZTE_USA_Inc)> A North American subsidiary of ZTE,[32] with headquarters in Richardson, Texas,[33] ZTE USA Inc offers wireless handset and networking products in the US.

dxq3rcb,OphidianZ,This is the exact reason I won't touch those garbage phones.
dxqlv90,ede91,"Huawei has some pretty nice cheap phones and some quite good high quality ones. There were no security concerns with their phones, it was with their networking equipment (quite bogus ones though) but they get a blanket ban basically."
dxri5sb,OphidianZ,Won't touch them. The level of Chinese spyware and back doors that COULD exist in those phones is much higher than any other phone. Getting a phone not made in China is difficult unless it's a Samsung. Then there's still a small chance it came from one of their Chinese factories. Probably made in Vietnam tho.

dxps7dy,diezdiasdios,Or...they could just not violate UN and International law by selling technology to countries under global sanctions.
dxpuvlj,Xamry14,But wouldn't more tech be good for the people in those countries? The people that we are trying to educate about the outside world so they may start to question their own governments?
dxpx11u,loljetfuel,The governments in question will control information flow regardless of how much tech is sold to their public. Selling more tech to Iran will do literally nothing to change the regime there.
dxq2b1u,Stupid_Triangles,> But wouldn't more tech be good for the people in those countries?Yes. That's why we don't sell it to them when we sanction them. It's depriving the population of a good or service to incite anger in the masses to force the government to act. >The people that we are trying to educate about the outside world so they may start to question their own governments? Ain't nobody in North Korea got money to buy a cellphone. The middle east is also not a tech bastion.
dxpthy6,cosmopolitaine,"It's because of a feud between ZTE and Huawei that ZTE is on its back foot, and it tried to enter the markets that Huawei dare not enter to gain some leeway."

dxqm6gl,German_Camry,Android is aosp. All the Google stuff is added.
dxqn0u1,rhenmaru,So if something is open source they won't be ban?
dxqor5k,German_Camry,"Maybe. The only way you would get Google anything is if you are a part of the open handset alliance. I'd not, then you are boned. You could go something Android based, like Sailfish OS, which is Android based but doesn't use Google anything. Or Ubuntu touch, but this is based off of Android 4.4 KitKat which kinda sucks."
dxqm70q,unsubstantiation,"no, they already aren't allowed to sell in the US, so they can ignore us laws, install android, google apps, use mediatek processors."
dxpi4gy,SuperiorExcess,USA chip mfg. sells chips to China Chip Buyer Inc. which sells them on to Totally Not ZTE Holdings which sells them on to ZTE. There's ways around and the Chinese don't give a fuck.
dxpitat,DrHoppenheimer,"That's not how embagoes work. Knowingly or negligently selling to an embargoed country or company, directly or indirectly, is illegal.If you're buying a handful of chips via a reseller, you can probably fly under the radar but not a big order like ZTE would need."
dxpluit,majaka1234,Just like how copyright and patent infringement is syyyyuuuper illegal.Go and tell that to guangdong. You could probably power several devices with the sonic force of the laughs you get.
dxpsaa2,Dyslexic_Wizard,"China doesn't manufacture very many ICs, and definitely not cutting edge nodes. China can try to steal the IP, but semi conductors are very tough."
dxq3cwn,German_Camry,Mediatek and Spreadtrum SoCs are still available

dxqt3nl,kolgrim88,"False, go read some more."
dxpz1qk,not-a-doctor-,"Patents are still enforced at scale. Yes, there's always going to be knockoffs, small shops making a quick buck, but they're not going to be sold in Walmart or by a large enterprise. There's a difference."
dxq2adh,L_Blisset,"Different degrees of gravity. As part of my job I handle projects with dual-use and export controlled technology. The amount of red tape needed to move even a single item is astonishing. I've seen deals fall through because for my company selling to particular customers is simply not worth the hassle, even at more than market value."
dxpqexj,droans,"You'd be correct if the chip manufacturers were all Chinese.They could try to go for only Chinese chips, such as Mediatek and others, but they'd never be allowed to get Intel, Broadcomm, Qualcomm, etc. The US could attempt to pressure the foreign companies to not deal with ZTE but it could end pretty badly if the Chinese government got involved."
dxq3tb8,OphidianZ,"One of their potential ""outs"" is a Taiwan based company.Pressuring a company in Taiwan AGAINST a Chinese company might be quite easy."
dxpx6l2,loljetfuel,"> Knowingly or negligently selling to an embargoed country or company, directly or indirectly, is illegal.Yes, but (a) the whole country of China isn't embargoed and (b) it's not negligent to sell to a company that doesn't disclose they do business with ZTE. The US companies will do their due diligence, but the Chinese buyers can easily hide the ultimate destination.Basically, a Chinese company buys a bunch to distribute to various manufacturers, promises not to sell them to ZTE, and then does anyway. The US org can't possibly control that or know it in advance, they can only do due diligence. _It doesn't require the US company to be complicit or negligent!_Maybe the US catches the distributor and adds them to the embargo. Then they shut down and some other distributor fills the void."
dxpz6ry,not-a-doctor-,"Have you ever purchased electrical components? It's pretty controlled, usually for quality reasons. You cannot just call a random distributor to purchase 100k of one IC reliably. Sure they can maybe piecemeal it together, but along with the fact that components are never even stocked, that won't come close to an actual supply chain to support a large scale production operation."
dxps1jl,Dyslexic_Wizard,"Nope, that's not how it works."
dxpqobf,Bendable-Fabrics,Theres no US made chips in ZTE phones.The OS was developed by ZTE. Android is public domain.
dxprr87,logik9000,"Glancing, it seems almost all of them run on Qualcomm chips."
dxq4hqh,SuperiorExcess,Sure.
dxq7pzd,Awdayshus,"The article said 50-65% of their chips are from the US. The nail in the coffin for ZTE is the apps. They'll probably be able to keep making phones, but the software ban means they'll only be able to sell them in China."
dxqga2i,rabbittexpress,Which is only a market of 1 billion people.
dxqrbjl,Awdayshus,"Right. The article makes it sound like it will hurt them, but probably won't be the end of the company. Headline is kind of sensational."
dxqhf63,r2doesinc,I work for a small MVNO and we just dropped all support for ZTE devices for the forseeable future.
dxptj0k,Cpt-Murica,"That's their best bet, focusing on the Chinese market which seems to be very difficult to get into. So still probably a death sentence."
dxqa2hm,SailTheWorldWithMe,Google maps and translate work. Word on the street Google Scholar is on it's way.
dxp53s2,CPTKrunsh,Honestly GAPPS can be added to any phone that has Android. Someone just has to do the work
dxp6411,fibdoodler,"While not ""hard"", finding and following a tutorial to get the store onto an android device would probably not occur to the people wandering into walmart or walgreens to buy a ZTE device.People who buy from those electronics selections are used to buying a product and using it as delivered. They're not the early adopter crowd and they're not buying past and current flagship devices. They are buying mobile connectivity devices just like they're buying toasters and vacuum cleaners - wander into a store, look at the selection, compare features and prices, and use it until they need a new one.The lack of gapps out of the box with no assurance that they can get it installed will be a big drawback."
dxpaj5e,WidenUranus,"This is a crucial point you make. I would further add, which you've alluded to, is that most people are path-of-least-resistance users and primary use default installed apps. Even if it's not hard to find a workaround, I'd still lean on the side that those that do are a market segment of “budget tinkerers.”As an aside, I wonder what the overall Western sentiment/attitude wrt on-device security these days (as opposed to the data stored on the cloud). Maybe I'm more paranoid than average, but cheap android, esp. mainland Chinese companies like ZTE, just screams insecure."
dxpbitn,Runnerphone,Exactly but the kicker is new versions of android google added a cert req meaning they can block devices hence even if you side load Google servers can still deny access to said software like the play store. While it's likely easy to get around if you know what you are doing most that buy the cheap phones won't nor people buying area flagship would in most cases want to risk voiding a warranty so will be easier to just buy another brand.
dxpajlq,middlehead_,"This won't be true much longer. Google is about to start enforcing device validation, meaning they'll only allow their services on phones that the manufacturer has run through them."
dxph5ol,therealxelias,"Elaborate? Enforcing it how? Unless they plan to have all apps require a completed handshake with the 'validation' server(s) prior to launching... any sort of localized validation method will be circumventable on a rooted device; because the ROM/OS Image can be modified to, at the very least, spoof the dataset that'd be pushed for validation to something *they know* the OS and/or device will resolve as conditionally true.Even isolated partition/lower level applications like Samsung's Knox are circumventable (assuming the effort is put in) due to their dependency on various localized assets. I can see Google implementing device validation as a default security feature; so it's not that I doubt your general statement; rather, I feel if they do, it'll be readily capable of being disabled from Developer options."
dxpiwv6,LjLies,"Enforcing it [like this](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/27/google-confirms-blocking-google-apps-uncertified-android-devices-heres-deal/).Of *course* their apps all have a handshake with the validation server, that's called [SafetyNet](https://www.lineageos.org/Safetynet/), and as of late, Google has started employing SafetyNet to [enforce running the Google Apps only on certified devices](https://www.lineageos.org/Google-Play-Certification/) (with an exception for individual users installing custom ROMs, but still, presumably, only on device models that would be certified to have the apps on stock ROMs).It's true that things can sometimes be circumvented, but your idea that SafetyNet, which is a rather complex piece of machinery, can be naively ""disabled from Developer options"" is just wrong. So far, it can be rendered ineffective using [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk), which is rather more involved than a tickmark in the options to begin with, and which already needs to keep racing against Google because with many times, a Magisk release will stop being able to trick the system into passing SafetyNet, after Google adds more checks, then Magisk works around those checks, etc... but rest assured that in the long run, Google has more abilities to implement more checks than the one Magisk guy who is currently busy with his army draft has time to work around them."
dxp66mp,Glattt,If Google finds out it's on a ZTE device they'll probably disable your account. Export laws are serious business.
dxpa6it,Nalivai,I think it's only about preinstalled apps. I don't think Google actually restricts what device you install their apps on.
dxpj5bv,LjLies,"[Yes, they do](https://www.lineageos.org/Google-Play-Certification/). The machinery has been in place for a long time, but the actual enforcement for their own Google apps has [only started happening as of recently](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/27/google-confirms-blocking-google-apps-uncertified-android-devices-heres-deal/)."
dxq3ki8,Nalivai,"Well, that sucks."
dxpzvjw,mrbkkt1,"Imagine a buying a car, but you aren't allowed to go to any gas stations. Sure you can have someone else go to the gas station and fill up small containers to fill your car, but it would be a huge PITA.

dxpv37g,Hawk978,"Oh no, I knew what you meant. I'm saying I've never had an issue with their server before. Maybe try downloading the smaller packages and then downloading the rest of the apps you need over Google Play?"
dxpvxxw,JerrathBestMMO,That is what I ended up doing! It's not a problem now... it's only ever a problem when you are sitting in front of twrp with an idle phone because you are still qaiting for the download to finish
dxpm0ol,myhandisstuck,"I-im reading this from my ZTE phone, I'm confused about what this might mean for me as a current owner"
dxprzzu,17954699,Probably nothing for now. It's possible Google might disable your ability to download apps from the Play Store though.
dxpt4fg,MissippiMudPie,In which case your download f-droid or yalp stores and continue as usual.
dxpyv6r,RamblingPedant,Would they really kill support on existing phones though? I'm guessing they'll just kill support on new exports.
dxp6m9e,Shizthesnorlax,I moved my mother from a ZTE phone to LG just two weeks ago. The phone did its job but it was painfully slow. I was going to get her another ZTE phone but I went with LG instead. I'm glad I did.

dxqo5ei,CasuallyAgressive,Mine was a POS and they wouldn't honor my warranty since I was a week past my one year old Warranty.
dxqor9o,Colonel_of_Wisdom,Idk why you would be upset with the company if you were past the warranty date. It sucks but if the warranty is expired I don't know what you expected.
dxqs3pu,CasuallyAgressive,Because a well known issue with a phone should be fixed. The camera became unusable due its vibration issue when trying to focus.
dxpefgc,patstar5,Well most people probably buy they're cheap phones which are crappy. The axon line has been great.
dxpwffp,LeapdayzNutz,Bought my mom a ZTE phone a few years ago. It worked OKAY for her but she would constantly get all this spyware and other random bullshit. One month she racked up tons of data for no reason. I got her a Moto G5 Plus for a Christmas present and she hasn't had one issue. Glad I got her off the ZTE as well but it was a good first smart phone for her.
dxpjo37,RoboBronson,"I've had a ZTE Max Pro for about 18 months and have been totally happy with it. I've put it through very heavy use not having any other kind of pc or tablet for most of that time. My only internet service was through my phone and I was able to stream Netflix to my smart TV and play my PS4 online with no problems using it as a hotspot. For the price, I thought it was fantastic."
dxpvkrp,wheresWaldo000,Same. I was actually considering going with the blade or whatever is the slightly better phone just because i could use a new battery. This one is still doing great though.
dxq7dhl,ZeroFoxGivenToday,"I have the ZTE Blaze Z Max Pro as well, and I love it. I'm an avid electronics user and this phone has been able to do anything I requested of it. The best part is I got the phone free. My intention was to keep it as a backup and buy the galaxy s8, but it worked so well I never had enough justification to actually get the s8. 6"" screen, runs pubg mobile, great battery life, it even has the finger print sensor on the back. The only drawback is metroPCS, but that has nothing to do with ZTE."
dxq8urr,RoboBronson,"I actually got mine through T-Mobile. I just walked into the store needing a new phone, saw the price and couldn't resist. Pubg mobile runs mostly ok for me, but damn does the phone get hot when running it for an extended period."
dxq9xau,ZeroFoxGivenToday,"That's odd, I'm mid match actually and my phone doesn't feel any warmer than normal, my old galaxy s5 used to feel like a fireball after charging, this phone hasn't had any heat issues yet."
dxpfcvc,Smitty-Werbenmanjens,"MicroG, F-Droid and Yalp Store is all you need."
dxpgxi7,tfoust10,"While I am not sure about what ZTE does with my personal info, I will say that I LOVE ZTE customer service. They seriously have provided me with the best customer service experience. I have had iPhone and 2 Samsung Galaxies and a Google Pixel. ZTE blows them out of the water with customer service. The Axon 7 rocks for the price but the camera is mehh... I was waiting to buy the successor of that line."
dxp715d,waterloograd,"I had an Amazon tablet that didn't come with GApps, so I installed them myself. Took about 5 minutes on Google following step by step instructions. Only way to make a mistake was if you skipped a step or get so frustrated with simple tasks you breakdown into tears whenever something doesn't go your way."
dxplcl7,uberamd,"Fire tablet? I got one of those, did the same thing, and performance went to absolute shit on a device that was already a dog in the performance department. Tears did flow."
dxple93,waterloograd,I really only use it for reddit and YouTube and haven't noticed any drawbacks from it
dxpxhyd,xmu806,"Luckily, those tablets aren't all that pricey."
dxpas0x,WidenUranus,But do most people do this?
dxpawa4,waterloograd,It is pretty easy to do
dxpb5jy,WidenUranus,"I don't disagree with that, but I'm wondering what the percentage of people that do.Note that Google could block banned device manufacturers from installing their apps so that they are in compliance. Violating this could result in some hefty fines."
dxpb89e,waterloograd,"Oh, ya, not many people even know its possible. My friend got the same tablet as me and was saying how someone told him that it was possible. I was a no-brainer for me, but he was shocked that you could install essentially any software you wanted (that was designed for android)"
dxpbh7h,WidenUranus,"Imo, being able to do this is the main reason I would get a Fire tablet. I have too many computing devices atm, but I'm always eyeing that ultra cheap one (20-something bucks or whatever it is)."
dxpig54,HallowedError,"I have it, wanted to use it for picture-heavy PDFs and it wasn't fast enough for me and the resolution was too low for it to replace my phone for Netflix. But it's decent if you just want a cheap eReader that can sorta do other stuff"
dxpisw0,WidenUranus,"Yeah, the low res screen isn't great. The one thing about this device, because of its price, is that they're cheap enough to mount (and leave) in places like a kitchen as a substitute for a mini TV screen, recipe reader, timer, for example.But the speed might be too slow. I was wondering if some folks part the screen out for a Rasp Pi display if someone is so inclined. Might not be possible or easy, idk."
dxq9x0g,Leprecon,"So most people would not manage 😂Seriously, unless something is absolutely stupidly simple people won't really do it."
dxp5nov,go2001,Just bought a ZTE is it recommended to return it asap ?
dxp7m6g,cartechguy,I don't see how this would affect current owners. You already have a phone with the operating system and play store. The gov isn't going to come into your home and confiscate it and you can't be forced to update the phone.
dxp81cm,go2001,Could they restrict playstore? I was thinking Apps might become unusable if they restrict playstore you cant update them right? Eventually they would become unusable if you couldn't update
dxpcyhg,GoatsClimbTrees,"I would think they instead of a blanket ban on all ZTE devices, Google would just have a date, say the 1st of may, where Google accounts could no longer be added to ZTE Android phones which had never been used with Google services before. This would allow current owners to continue using their device but buyers of new ZTE devices from the first of may could not"
dxpj71j,LjLies,"Yes, they could. At this time, it's unknown whether they will."

dxps0yr,17954699,"Yes, but it will be a Chinese OS."
dxq2hug,JoeEatWorld,They could also go a free and open source route which would be awesome and (especially with privacy scandals like Facebook - Cambridge Analytica) a pretty genius marketing move.
dxq4j5z,GodOfPlutonium,You know android is open source right?
dxq5iz2,JoeEatWorld,Every app from google is not open source and is not free as in libre. Google spies on everyone big time while pretending to be open source.
dxq9sz1,ConciselyVerbose,"But the OS is still open source. You don't have to have google apps installed. If that's your priority, there are plenty of phones with custom builds available for you to use."
dxqd940,JoeEatWorld,"And ZTE could use Google-free custom ROMs with FOSS only, which would be awesome."
dxqgoei,rabbittexpress,Samsung is not Google...
dxp6pbm,vivek31,I would love a google free experience out of the box.

As a suggestion, look through XDA-Developers. It's been awhile since I've done this but when I did I remember there being tutorials on how to go GAPPS free"
dxpgd3l,vivek31,I do. That's why I said out of the box.
dxq88ox,Helmera,"Agreed. Buying an android phone straight from China, they dont have google playstore or other app installed on it, or yes an iphone."

dxp7lbb,Snazzy_Serval,Then you want an iPhone.
dxpvudt,papasmurph,I wonder how USA can affect a company's rights to sell to certain countries.
dxpwobx,Nope_______,"The US controls the global financial/banking system. If countries don't like it, they can make their own global banking system. Why do you think Russia gets sanctioned out the wazoo by the US but nobody in the US gets sanctioned by the Russians?"
dxpxr1r,NoVA_traveler,"Because most Americans don't have significant investments in Russia, for one."
dxpxx84,Nope_______,"Partly, yeah."
dxqgxhg,papasmurph,"The connections are still a bit mysterious (even though I probably shouldn't be surprised): Banking is in theory completely external to the government. Not even the Federal Reserve is a government institution. The US government defines the laws for US, but stopping one country to sell to another can't be a US law, considering both Mainland China and Iran are completely sovereign. I understand that US can issue an embargo so that Qualcomm and Google can't sell stuff to ZTE though. UN is not mentioned, so such criteria don't seem to be in play here."
dxq5rzh,dangerouspangolin,"What 's stopping ZTE to ""sell"" all its assets to ""another"" company basically just renaming itself, but legally be a whole another company?"
dxqgqfr,rabbittexpress,laws...
dxqp1jn,Year_of_the_Alpaca,"I am not a lawyer, and I don't know whether [piercing the corporate veil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercing_the_corporate_veil) specifically would apply here (#). However, this does show that in extremely serious cases the default treatment of a corporation as a distinct entity from those behind it- for purposes of diverting liability- can be disregarded.I'd be surprised if that- or something similar- didn't apply here, since otherwise it would be fairly easy to get round punitive measures like this.(#) Or whether that only applies to *individuals* using a corporation as legal cover for obviously personal activities or fraud."
dxpa85j,alastairsnook,"Maybe I'm wrong, but can't you just flash a different OS ROM onto the phone. Like Lineage or Cyanogen OS or something? Sorry if I'm completely missing the point?"
dxpp3ts,splinter1545,"Yes, but there's quite a few models (like mine; the blade x max) that can't flash or be rooted at all. So while a possible work around, it wouldn't be an option for everybody."
dxpyxa9,RamblingPedant,I'd consider it more if only I were certain I could retain Dolby drivers and Daydream support on my Axon 7
dxpekub,YoroSwaggin,"Yes you can, but that takes effort, and the ROM might not be good."
dxpdwsm,protopet,"i think it would depend on how the ban is implemented. Lineage and Cyanogen are still android based and probably use Gapps heavily. If google locks off the phones by model, then you would have to try and spoof the model number to their servers. Also you'd still have to get those OS versions working on phones not available in the US (meaning smaller market share and less chance someone will pick up the torch and port it."
dxpjery,LjLies,"For a start: CyanogenMod has stopped existing months ago, and has basically *become* LineageOS, so putting them one next to the other makes no sense.Neither of them ""uses Gapps"" at all, because they are not even legally allowed to: they do not *include* them, and the user has to obtain them separately if they want them. It's perfectly possible to use a phone without them (I do so), but the vast majority of users do seem to want them.That said, Google [already locks the phones off](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/27/google-confirms-blocking-google-apps-uncertified-android-devices-heres-deal/), by model, but also by a [complicated and proprietary set of criteria and checks known as SafetyNet](https://developer.android.com/training/safetynet/index.html), which are not at all easy to ""spoof"" (though it's possible, with the constant risk that the spoof will stop working: just browse through the [Magisk forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk) to know)."
dxpz8w7,Nwizugbo,Currently reading this on a ZTE
dxqbpsl,dragontology,"Either we're overstating the importance of Google apps, or if we're not, Google's power reaches too far. However, I think it's the former. Bundle Microsoft apps, if that's not a problem (with Microsoft), and slap F-Droid, the free and open source app repository, on it. Android phones don't really need Google per se, Google stuff is just really good and works well together. But an Android phone is like a Windows PC, you can put whatever you want on it."

dxpfmh3,abs159,"Wait? What? I thought ""Android was open""?"
dxpjkuk,LjLies,"You had a very partial version of the story.AOSP is indeed open; a lot of what's actually installed on Google-certified Android phones (mainly the Google Service Framework and Apps) is not open at all, being only licensed for use on certified devices, and for that matter, neither are most of the firmware blobs and hardware drivers open."
dxpjqfu,hatessw,"It is. Microsoft or Apple could easily copy current Android, and put in and release their own improvements. In fact, I think that would be *the* way to overthrow Google's popularity in the mobile space.That said, Google apps are not open in general (maybe with some exceptions). Closed Google apps run on Android much like closed Microsoft apps, closed Facebook apps, etc."

dxpyano,truenortheast,Chinese smart phones sold in mainland China have all gapps blocked by the os itself. It will delete them even if side-loaded. They'll probably just start selling Baidu Android devices to non-US overseas markets.

dxq9ong,truenortheast,"Ok, so you've figured out an easier solution than I have. But it still involves taking additional steps and being aware of the existence of such an app, then sideloading. Not really what most would consider a smooth process.On numerous Chinese market phones (I'd never actually buy a phone from a Chinese company) I've had apps appear to install fine, but not actually function. The play store specifically will close to a black screen and be removed by any ota update.Also, no offence but are you actually Chinese? Like with a Chinese passport and National ID card? Or maybe you ""identify as Chinese"" because that's where your parents are from?I have a number of Chinese friends here who've been overseas for 10 years or more and they probably couldn't read English at the level you write at.

You probably know better than I do that there are some very big and very specific difficulties for Chinese speakers learning to speak English at a native level.

The cheap phones that Iran, etc, have an appetite for will still be sold. Instead of a US backdoored OS, they will use a Chinese backdoored OS instead.

dxp6px0,marklein,This thing that gets me is that virtually every cell phone is made in China or by a Chinese contractor.
dxp75gg,cartechguy,When people say not to buy something Chinese they're often actually talking about Chinese brands. /u/Oxygen95 didn't say phones manufactured in China but he was vague enough that you could easily interpret as a phone with any sort of relation to china such as it being a Chinese brand or manufactured in China.
dxp7pay,Oxygen95,"Thank you. Yes, I meant Chinese brands."
dxp8ccl,cartechguy,"Yeah, there's a big difference between an American company that oversees the engineering and QA process of a good manufactured in China as opposed to a wholly Chinese product. However, the Chinese products are getting better and better over time."

dxpa5ij,marklein,"Right, but I argue that this isn't important.

dxp4r6u,Auricom93,ZTE phones are shit phones anyway :).
dxp5mre,Yupyupyup2u,"Yep love my Axon 7 too. Best speakers on a phone I've ever had. Less than 400 bucks, can't beat it."
dxp4xpy,dlist925,I really love my Axon 7 though...
dxp528y,FireFtw,"Likewise, one of the best phones I've ever had and it didn't even cost me much.edit: oh sorry, didn't know I wasn't allowed to like my phone."
dxp59x6,dlist925,Mine's still running strong with a custom Oreo rom!
dxp5i5m,Auricom93,Didn't say you weren't allowed to like your phone. Read my comment carefully lol.
dxp5nuq,FireFtw,"Not you, last time I saw the comment it was at -1."
dxp73rk,CtheKiller,"I left the flagship bandwagon years ago and best decision I've made. Bought the Axon 7 for $200 on craigslist, great deal, and has served me so well, has all flagship specs for a fifth of the price. Can't wrap my mind around why people have to spend a thousand dollars upgrading iPhones every year."
dxp83z2,dlist925,The only thing I really miss that a phone like that would have is the camera. Although it looks like I may have to look into OnePlus devices or something similar because I don't think we'll be getting the axon 7 successor that I've been looking forward to for a while
dxp9yic,silvertricl0ps,"I really wanted an Axon successor because if they got sprint to approve it this time, it would be the only dual sim phone that supports both sprint and verizon so I wouldn't have to carry 2 phones everywhere:("
dxpa7o3,dlist925,Have you tried just not using Sprint? :p
dxpabnq,silvertricl0ps,Sprint is $3 a month and works well in my area
dxpaouc,NogaraCS,"What do you get for 3$ a month ? (Not American, just for curiosity)"
dxpdwfg,SlammingPussy420,He left off 00.
dxphmxb,silvertricl0ps,Unlimited everything
dxp63xe,loveforthetrip,Loved mine too but it's annoying me for a few days now as it likes to turn itself off if I move it too much or sometimes it just turns itself off and won't even restart for some time.Hope I can get it fixed as it served me well for 1.5 years
dxp6pue,dlist925,"ZTE Warranty support was amazing for me when I was having issues, you should def give them a call and get a replacement while you still can. Make sure to ask for an advance replacement, makes the whole process so much smoother."
dxp7osa,loveforthetrip,"Was definitely going to contact them, I hope I'll also have a good experience"
dxp67ij,Tivia,"I mean, it is a $25 throwaway smart phone..the fuck were you expecting for $25?"
dxp9zl1,silvertricl0ps,Moto E4 is an amazing phone for $40 at Walmart
dxphnfa,Tivia,I don't want to spend $40..I give this phone to a 7 year old as a toy. I'm perfectly happy with that it does for $25. :)
dxpicub,silvertricl0ps,"In that case, if the kid doesn't care then yeah they can have the cheapest stuff there is. Anyone who wants a throwaway cheap phone and cares about usability should just skip the Samsungs and ZTEs and get a Motorola if it's the same price"
dxp5goz,MuhMogma,Not for the price.
dxpenvs,Werewolf35b,Zmax pro best $100 I ever spent on electronics.
dxpawu1,TheHarbarmy,"I actually bought a ZTE a few months ago, I and returned it the next day because it wouldn't connect to the network (even though it should have). Looks like I may have dodged a bullet."
dxpgrem,zgozy,"Too bad, ZTE Axon 7 is the closest thing to a ""Thinkpad-esque non-plebian device for nerds"" the cell phone world has."
dxpacck,TrunkPopPop,A cautionary tale for other corporations.
dxpj74i,ReggieMX,ZTE can just ignore the US market and keep profitting.
dxpnfhd,notfin,Not really because let's say zte use chips made in U.S. by Qualcomm. Pretty much they have to find a different chip supplier then find a way make that chip work just a good as a Qualcomm.
dxqfr3a,ReggieMX,You mean Mediatek chips? those are cheaper than qualcomm's and work pretty decent. In fact a lot of ZTE phones use mediatek chipsets
dxpet48,Onlyspacemanspiff,Maybe they shouldn't have supplied parts to North Korea and Iran. Serves them right.
dxpmeqh,mindbleach,"Fuck ZTE, but it's a travesty that users don't control what's on their phones. They are pocket computers. No manufacturer should constrain what OS you run or what software's installed."
dxpacej,matt_cb,"I used to have a ZTE Valet about 4 years ago, it was actually the worst piece of technology I have ever used. This news doesn't surprise me at all."
dxpehrc,somekid66,Oh no what will all the crack dealers use now?
dxpkade,ShardikTheGuardian,Good thing mine just broke!
dxp7wwi,FreeSpeechIsCancer,USA #1 economic terrorist
dxpa6xr,melcrose,"Not really. They F'd up, they were told to pay a fine and take specific action. They paid the fine but did not take the action they agreed to take. Once found out, the gov'mint put the smack-down on them."
dxpjipa,ravia,Are we supposed to read this with an accent?
dxp5px5,SummonerRock1,"Edit: After actually looking at the article, I found out that it actually WASN'T about the trade war. My mistake."
dxp6brm,Clegko,"It's ZTEs fault. They sold to NK and Iran while they were sanctioned, then lied about it."
dxpbbvn,ribnag,"So what?I'm serious, so what? The US needs to get its head out of its ass and realize that no, they *can't* tell he rest of the world who they can and can't be friends with.This isn't just about hegemony - This is about the fact that we have the two biggest countries in the world, both with large modern militaries and a total population larger than the US and Europe combined, telling us to go pound sand.That doesn't end well if we keep pretending we're the only 900lbs gorilla on the block."
dxpkhsm,Scalpum,ZTE agreed to the DPA. Hence the 'A' for agreement.
dxpqevx,ribnag,"When the Mafia holds a gun to your head and says ""sign this""... That's not a valid contract.If a woman ""consents"" to have sex with a man who can make-or-break her entire career, that's still not considered a valid form of consent because she didn't really have a choice. When someone asks if you're a god, *you say yes*!When a government gives you a ""choice"", you sign the frickin' papers. That's *still* not ""A""greement, it's *self preservation*.FWIW, I'm not in any way claiming ZTE is in the right here. I just don't think the US can really claim the moral high ground. Two out of three world superpowers disagree with our stance. Who's right?"
dxpunyl,Scalpum,"Read up on ZTE. They are not right. Your analogies are terrible, despite how much I love ghostbusters."
dxpwuwc,Nope_______,">The US needs to get its head out of its ass and realize that no, they *can't* tell he rest of the worldThe US can, and does. You may not like it, but it's true."
dxp7f2n,RationalLies,"Kinda like how IBM sold the Nazis machines to catalog and number Jews during the concentration camp days?(both are bad things, I definitely not defending ZTE in any way, just pointing out that America is guilty of turning a blind eye to sanctions as well)"
dxpin6f,young_legendary,Username checks out.
dxp8eui,popo74,"IBM would be be an independent business being assholes for doing that. What they (and their German subsidiaries) did doesn't reflect on the rest of American business or the government, frankly. I know their brand of it is a bit wierd, but China is a socialist country, and it seems these ZTE people have at least some ties to the Chinese government, so it feels like a bit of a false equivolancy to compare them I guessEdit: ...Why the fuck are we both getting down voted lol?"
dxp767k,Leonidas3000,You should really thank him. What he does about China is one of the few clever things no Democrat would have done.
dxpdge2,SummonerRock1,"~~This trade war against China might do a lot more harm than good, considering most of our gadgets are made there. And this is one of the casualties of that war.~~EDIT: I didn't read the article at the time of this comment. I have since looked at the article and wish to apologize to you and to the US government... for this one."
dxpbu6g,moumokumusic,Honestly hate ZTEs anyway.

dxoxcg5,Zestymonserellastick,"You do realize that means it blocks the app playstore and all google apps. Which means it would have no GPS solution, no way to download apps other than source web pages. You may as well buy a flip phone."
dxoxfz9,rejectedstrawberry,"it doesnt *block* anything, you can manually install it yourself if you want.And the GPS will work with google apps or without. its completely independent. And there are more app stores than just what google offers."
dxp0hp1,ben_db,"Unfortunately without Google play services installed, a lot of apps won't run even if you sideload them."
dxoxneg,Zestymonserellastick,"Play store is exclusively attached to a google android OS. You cannot install the play store on a non google android OS. Which is why all android smart phones run a google based OS.Hence, you cannot just install it on an apple device.Apps don't just magically work with anything."
dxoy4fy,rejectedstrawberry,"article is talking about google apps. Not the OS, and the small bit that does talk about the OS says that ZTE will most likely continue using android. also i love this bit here>You cannot install the play store on a non google android OS. Which is why all android smart phones run a google based OS.You do recognize that android *is* the OS right? there is no *not* google android. sounds like you sure know what youre talking about"
dxp05mu,The_Superfist,"You wont be able to run the Google Play app store if your version of Android is locked out because it's not a Google licensed version of Android.Google Android has become the standard. Yes Android is free and open source so they can still run an Android OS, but you won't be able to install or use the Play Store which is the primary gateway to Android apps.So the only way you will be able to install apps would be either the ones provided by ZTE or download from the web directly from the app distributor, which is rare anymore."
dxp0cls,rejectedstrawberry,">You wont be able to run the Google Play app store if your version of Android is locked out because it's not a Google licensed version of Android.there are so many ways around that its not even funny.>Google Android has become the standard. Yes Android is free and open source so they can still run an Android OS, but you won't be able to install or use the Play Store which is the primary gateway to Android apps.again, for many this is a good thing due to google apps being malware/spyware, and installing a 3rd party appstore is trivial."
dxp0kf5,The_Superfist,"Finding a way around it isn't comon and most people wont buy a phone if they have to root it or otherwise find workarounds to make it usable. Especially when there are perfectly viable options out there.For you, this might all be great and perfect for your use. Just realize that you're in a minority of users and that ZTE could still be very hard hit by this."
dxp84v0,kkubq,ZTE will be hit hard for sure. But don't say you can't install Play Store or the only way of installing apps is through ZTE or webpages when this isn't true.
dxoy8bh,Zestymonserellastick,Did you read the article? Did you not understand it? Or do you not how operating systems work?
dxp5r6s,metafruit,"Google at least provides services. And their apps are definitely the best in the industry, usually. Have fun with your open source solutions..."
dxp66m9,jeremy_jer,The bully strikes again.
dxp6o8f,puffmaster5000,"Apparently they broke sanction rules, not because trump just dirtied his diaper"
dxp7iyq,cartechguy,I'm a little confused on this. From the article it sounded like they were implying they can use the android OS as long as they remove the app store. I still don't see how that's possible. Android may be an open and free operating system but it's still a licensed american product. As far as I understand they shouldn't be allowed to use anything from google whether it's free or not.
dxp8k7c,sonicscrewup,"Android is open source though, as far as I understand it."
dxpa9d2,melcrose,Android is open source and available to all. The google line of products (gmail / play store / etc) are not available to all unless certain conditions are met.
dxpadqf,sonicscrewup,"That's my point, maybe that wasn't clear. ZTE can't ship with google apps, but it can ship with android as android is open source"
dxpbnbv,cartechguy,I understand that. It's still a licensed American product albeit a free one. From what I understand the company is banned from using American technology so I don't see how they can continue selling phones in the us. Whether it's free seems irrelevant.
dxpfc0w,Smitty-Werbenmanjens,"They can take the source code and compile their own version of Android with it. Like Replicant or Lineage.Or they can call it Android, since the Chinese don't care if they use a name they don't have a trademark on."
dxpjvof,LjLies,"It is pretty relevant when the actual ruling is a ban to *American companies* from *selling products* to ZTE.By simply using the freely available, freely licensed AOSP code, ZTE isn't buying anything from Google, and Google is literally not doing anything.Once again, the proprietary Google frameworks that most phones in the west include (but not most phones sold in China) are a different story, as they do require commercial deals between Google and the licensed OEM."
dxpw70x,XportR,"There is a carve-out in the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) for publicly available source code (and corresponding object code). Its evolution in the regulations over time is interesting to a very few Trade nerds, but I'll oversimplify and say it is a reflection of the First Amendment Right to free speech. This is why, in this case, free is relevant."
dxpayn2,ribnag,"The US government really can't do a damned thing to ZTE directly. What they *can* do is punish any other (US) companies that continue to do business with ZTE.Android is (mostly) FOSS; you could roll your own distro tomorrow and Uncle Sam can't do anything but piss and moan about it. The Android app store, however, is controlled by Google. Uncle Sam **can** put some serious hurt on Google. Thus, Google will be forced to actively block ZTE.That said, this is *still* a joke, because there are trivial ways around such a block - From spoofing the identity of the phone at the hardware level, to running their own app store that just blatantly rips off everything (at least, everything free) added to Google's own store."
dxpbrna,cartechguy,>The US government really can't do a damned thing to ZTE directly. They can ban the import of their phones into the us. That's what this is about.
dxpfyag,ribnag,"You're half right...They're banning the sale of US parts/tech **to** ZTE. That's why the whole ""app store"" issue comes up.If this was just a matter of importation, there wouldn't be any question about whether or not they could off the Android app store. The rest of the world could have it, and there wouldn't even be a story here."
dxpjzrd,LjLies,"No, it's not. This ban forbids US companies from selling things to ZTE. It doesn't forbid ZTE from selling gadgets in the US (although there was already a previous ban forbidding US *government agencies* from buying ZTE equipment, but that isn't binding on individuals and commercial companies, obviously)."
dxpjsdp,LjLies,"The ban is about US companies selling products to ZTE. When ZTE is simply using the freely-available, freely-licensed Android code (part of which don't belong to Google at all, see: the Linux kernel), ZTE is not buying anything from Google, and Google is not contravening any ban.Now, the proprietary Google services (which most phones sold in China *do not have*, despite running Android, incidentally) are a different matter."
dxpedye,patstar5,"Such a shame they are forcing them out of business. ZTE Axon 7 was such a great phone, probably had the best speakers out of any phone. Was looking forward to a successor."
dxpgzye,eltomas2003,no offense to ZTE but almost nobody really cares about their products.
dxp8cn5,DYMAXIONman,It's not like Google software works in China
dxpdp8b,TheOGdeez,F?
dxpekmn,Radiogeek89,"Yes you should worry. I've had 3. One by ignorance, one by brand name cover, and one by accident. None were worth a dime. One wouldn't recharge. Two refuse to work part of the time. Take it back."
dxpmr6y,Junkymix,Oh no they have to use Bing LMAO
dxpmyg5,ZiggidyZ,"Do foreign companies have personhood or is that only a US thing? Toss top execs in jail, put ZTE in a corporate jail, company liquidated unable to do business for the term of the sentence."
dxpou0y,SoFunnyAmI,Good news! Wish that happened to all Chinese manufacturera.
dxpqois,TaintEater69,Might be a good thing for privacy. Fuck GApps. Always root your android phone and put a custom rom without GApps and use F-Droid.
dxprdq5,Insomniacrobat,Anything we can do to get rid of Google is a good thing.
dxpuj21,Taiiere,I'd return it. It's a paper weight.
dxpx2kf,LinearActuator,Isn't it weird that the commerce department would punish ZTE by forcing them to sell superior phones? Android is much better without the google apps.

dxpio08,RaycoSantana,"I bought one a year ago, It was the worst phone I Ever had, hands down. Never buying one of those again. Also bought a Xiaomi Mi A1 to replace It and is fucking awesome."
dxpn5f5,nine_tail,I would never buy Chinese backdoor infested phones anyway.
dxpober,advion,Instead you will buy 'reputable' backdoor infested phones.
dxpod1v,nine_tail,Well then I don't need extra backdoors right?

dxpco9h,AndiMischka,"Well, you won't be buying $50 iPhones at Walmart, so I guess that's true."
dxpdznt,SlammingPussy420,Didn't spend $900 on a phone that's outdated in 10 months./Justsaying
dxpemcd,libracker,Feel free to post performance benchmarks from current Android phone against 10 month old iPhone./justsaying
dxpfrj0,SlammingPussy420,I would but I'm counting all the money I'm saving sticking to mid tier Android phones.
dxpg28d,libracker,"Be honest with yourself for a moment and imagine that if any Android phone beat an iphone in performance that you would say the same thing.Ridiculous, isn't it?"
dxph0qv,SlammingPussy420,"I'm not worried about performance. What do I need to use all that performance on? My movies and games play the same. I can stream anywhere, I can make and receive calls and texts. I can do all the same shit your 900$ phone does for a fraction of the price. I also have external storage so I'll never ever run out of space. Not to mention that when I'm ready to upgrade or get another device I can and I'll have 2 phones for less money than your one. And if you get a good brand your phone will last for years. I work in cell phones. I know what phones last and what phones don't. I know multiple people are still using their Galaxy s4 like it was new. I can't say the same with people using iPhones. The latest model I've seen was 5. Most of the time it's going from a 6 to a 7 or an 8 to an X. But if you have a good reason on why that expensive performance machine operates in a way superior to mine in everyday use, I'll switch."
dxpha3z,libracker,Yet miraculously if Android beat Apple your response would be exactly the same.Of course it would.Of course.Carry on.
dxpix90,SlammingPussy420,Andriod does beat apple in my eyes.
dxpx86b,libracker,Not in performance.
dxpy6ow,SlammingPussy420,Right but you still haven't explained how that performance actually stands up? What do you do with all that performance that I can't?
dxpynfi,libracker,"The point is you claim the iPhone is out of date after 10 months.After 10 months they still beat the latest android handsets in performance.Honestly I couldn't care less what phone you use. If you like Android, that's great - use Android."
dxq25v6,SlammingPussy420,Your performance doesn't mean a thing when you can't explain what you do with it that I can't. And no worries. I am.
dxq4cws,libracker,Ok you really want to do this? Fine.I'll tell you what I can do. I can enjoy a really nice fast and smooth experience with high frame rates and no lag. Those inclined can run better games with better graphics and higher frame rates.It's funny how ‘specs' are all some people care about until Apple beats them. Then it's all hand wringing and questions such as ‘but what do you actually *need* all that power for?' while simultaneously trying to claim that Apple are somehow technically behind.
dxqehxt,bigpasmurf,"No, you get an overpriced hunk of crap."
dxqontk,libracker,...that kicks the ever living shit out of the competition in performance benchmarks.
dxqufis,bigpasmurf,"Apple has worse specs, a constricted ecosystem, terrible cost to performance ratio when compared to competition."
dxqxova,libracker,Yet still their phones manage to perform significantly faster than the competition.Not bad for allegedly having ‘worse specs'.
dxr4vbr,bigpasmurf,"Yeah, because it's a closed system with no room to expand or modify, more expensive apps and no storage platform of their own. Furthermore, that performance speed slows down significantly faster than its competition so that benefit you mention only lasts until the announcement of the next model."
dxr58a0,libracker,"> Furthermore, that performance speed slows down significantly faster than its competition so that benefit you mention only lasts until the announcement of the next model.Actually I believe you will find that the previous years iPhone still outperform the current years android models.It doesn't matter how you try to spin it, iPhones are faster, period. The evidence doesn't lie."

dxpflha,Ohyeahwellurapoohead,This is incorrect. Nokia bought a French mobile phone brand that is used under license by TLC (just like the Blackberry name is used under license by TLC). The Nokia brand is owned and manufactured by Nokia.
