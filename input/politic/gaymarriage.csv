c89w2ew,HeartyBeast,"Suddenly my marriage feels devalued.... oh hang on. No it bloody doesn't.Congratulations to all involved. But I'm still not going into gay bars, the beer's crap."
c89w4wb,HungryBook,...but the bears are great!
c89w9r7,HeartyBeast,A palpable hit!
c89y02t,beatskin,The power-bottoms are even better.

c8a7c7j,imatree,">Dennis Reynolds: I'm sure there's a great deal of switching back and forth but I think more often then not bears are tops, unless they happen to be power bottoms. >>Frank Reynolds: What's a power bottom? >>Mac: A power bottom is a bottom that is capable of receiving an enormous amount of power. >>Dennis Reynolds: Actually Mac, you've got it backwards. You see, the power bottom is actually generating the power by doing most of the work. >>Frank Reynolds: Does power have to do with size or strength of the bottom? >>Mac: Now Dennis, I heard speed has something to do with it. >>Dennis Reynolds: Speed has everything to do with it! You see, the speed of the bottom informs the top how much pressure he's supposed to apply. Speed's the name of the game."
c8aa5sx,Blastface,Yeah that didn't clear anything up.
c8ab7an,Aluxh,"A top is a penetrative partner, a bottom is the receiving partner. A bear is a large hairy man."

c8a4lpv,marchqueen,Oh your puns are so gay.
c89xnhj,G_Morgan,I find it amazing people even make that argument. Marriage is about finding some silly unfortunate woman or man to put up with your bullshit. It doesn't matter what other people do in this regard.
c89yzjx,hob196,"You romantic, youBut I do agree with your point. Are the small c conservatives worried that all the gays will somehow join in their marriage?"
c89zblj,thatstevelord,"Maybe they're worried that gays will steal all the closeted gay men from their show marriages, like politicians and what have you."
c8aa943,embossed,[Oh totally.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-YCdcnf_P8)
c89z2fd,Jeimuzu22,"Well said, sir/madam"
c89xe8x,,Not all gay bars are nightclubs you know..
c8a0pnd,HeartyBeast,"I admit, I'm jolly old and I'm judging this mainly from my days when I worked in Soho, London in the early 90s and used to go bars with some of my gay colleagues. I'm a pint over warm bitter man myself, so what was available on tap used to make me sad, not gay."
c8aa66d,Blastface,My liver just folded in on it's self from the amount of British in this comment.
c89y6n4,cmdcharco,but the music? its the best part about gay clubs! (well the ones I have been too)
c8a0unm,sp8der,Really? I'm a homo-iest homosexual and yet the music is the reason I avoid gay clubs like the plague.
c8a168o,cmdcharco,[the vaults](http://www.vaultsexeter.co.uk/) so much fun plus as a breeder there is no pressure to get laid :)
c8a1mnd,johnholmescock,"What about all the cheesy posters from Zipper magazine dotted around? Mind you, it's all on LCD screens now... Cocks and blow jobs all over the show. It makes me have to turn my head and finally have a really good excuse to stare at the cute bisex-lez boobs in order to provide serenity to my brain. That or head off to the dance floor."
c8aanqp,Lolworth,RELAX!
c89z2ia,Really_Likes_Nutella,Also Guinness is good wherever you go.
c89xc0i,CaptainFil,But the music's great.

c89zncw,DreadPirateMedcalf,Only if that troubles you. Or just wear a shirt that says 'straight'
c8aazu0,CA3080,Don't be that guy
c8a2gel,,Really? Have you been to a gay club lately? It's really not. The days of the gay scene leading dance music trends are waaay over. Today it's mainly awful tribal house or high tempo remixes of songs that really should never have been remixed.
c8a2526,,"Come on, fess up, you've been overcome with the urge to throw a gay orgy 3 times already this evening and you are now dangerously dehydrated.I know I have been..."
c8aa43n,codechris,"I'm not gay, but my gay friend loves G.A.Y in Soho and to be honest, for £1.70 a pint and the fact you often get some very nice women in there....I don't mind it so much"
c8a069q,tommorris,"Depends on the bar, honestly. There are very girly-cocktaily-fabulous gay bars, and much more pub-like gay bars that serve beer and never ever play Gaga or Madonna."
c8a1jen,johnholmescock,"The dance music is great and the not-so lesbians are fucking great too! Gaybars are cool. Oh, and ""Room Aroma"" like Liquid Gold is on tap and cheapest too!"
c8a9v22,cabalamat,"> But I'm still not going into gay bars, the beer's crapYou've not been to the [Regent](https://plus.google.com/100208057939167718060/about?gl=uk&hl=en) in Edinburgh then?"
c8aa3bn,HeartyBeast,"Nope, but it looks very nice."
c8aa5kz,Stelfury,I'm pretty sure every gay bar I have been into sold the same beer as every other bar.
c8aa735,HeartyBeast,"OK, the ones that I was familiar with in Soho were extremely short on nice real ales and very long on dull lagers, but that might be simply a function of them being being bars for the younger set. If there *are* any around Soho that do a decent pint, I am of course interested to know."
c8aargg,Stelfury,Oh well when it comes to nice real Ales a lot of pubs I have been into sadly lack those :(
c89wjxk,lechatcestmoi,And the music!
c89wmhr,HeartyBeast,What is it these days? If they still play Bronksi Beat and some Holly Johnson - I'm in.
c89wu0t,lechatcestmoi,"Do you regularly buy CDs from the ""NOW that's what I call music..."" series? If so, you'll love it."
c8a4ike,waldron76,"Honestly, that sounds like most of the clubs I've been to."
c8a219o,MrPoletski,I'VE GOT SOMTHIN TO PUT INNN YOUUU
c8a2f7z,,Although I have got gay friends who have said they feel their civil partnerships are devalued - that somehow it's no longer good enough.
c8a9bew,HeartyBeast,"Actually, that's a very good point that I hadn't thought about and rather sad. Marquee hire companies must be rubbing their hands."
c8a4zif,,Apparently I'm so attractive to other men that I get groped more than my female friends in clubs. For this reason I absolutely avoid gay bars.
c8a9f1e,Sir_Fancy_Pants,"Correct me if i am wrong, but isn't this vote just a formality in as much as gay marriage exists already it just has a different term.i.e any passed legislation doesn't afford any extra privilege or advantage other than ""recognition by others"""
c89xbyw,Some_angry_gringo,"Quoting a comment on The Independent's news article:""We're getting further and further from the Bible. We can't have slaves as the Bible allows, we can't kill blasphemers as the Bible allows, we can't stone adulterers as the Bible allows, and we can't force rapists to marry their victims as the Bible allows.Where will it all end?

c8a79pm,Boomer84,By the Brits?
c8a92cg,Lakey91,Not forgetting that common law thingy. That frustrating ideal that the law is transcendent and not merely a tool for the state. A stupid Christian ideal that stops the government from arresting people without charge or imprisoning without trial. Clearly a barrier to counter terrorism efforts.

The key thing to note is that Europe is becoming less religious but even then we are getting immigrants that bring their religion with them so it's balancing out. Our ""lovely Island"" as you point out isn't exactly without religious tension itself just go to Glasgow on old firm day and ask.Disclaimer: DO NOT go to Glasgow on old firm day... ever!"

c8a10ro,mistermarsbars,"Funny you should say that, because there are still a few legal inequalities left in this bill. They weren't able to define what constitutes consummation, so same-sex couples won't be able to divorce if the marriage wasn't consummated or if one partner committed adultery with another person of the same sex: http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2013/feb/05/gay-marriage-some-inequalities-remain"
c8a4o0r,philthehumanist,"Well unfortunately this again comes to how the institution that is marrying and how it defines consummation. Catholic canon law defines a marriage as consummated ONLY when the ""spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh."" I've seen a draft of a document for ""non-hetrosexual couples"" and it simply defines consummation as ""a bit of lezzing it up or some bum fun, maybe a thumb, maybe not... who's counting?"""
c8a9gge,Sir_Fancy_Pants,"Once your George Michael CD collection is shared with your partners ABBA CD collection,it is bound and bonded in nature, I do declare the couple consummated."

c8azobc,Sir_Fancy_Pants,"All joking aside, i would honestly have no issue being gay or coming out, as much as i understand i think it would be like in the situation or people i know (the adult world).school or teenage years i imagine would be a nightmare, but in the adult world, no one really cares do they?"
c8aztan,,Ever been told by complete strangers on the street that you should be shot and killed when all they know of you is that you're holding hands with another man?
c8b05c9,Sir_Fancy_Pants,"Shit, the only time i have ""pretended to be gay"" was when someone asked me if i was gay, and i thought they would have a problem with it, or get violent about it, so i would say ""yes"" .was that in the UK? i must confess, part of me would enjoy the hostility (assuming he didn't actually have a gun), because i like causing people distress if their distress is a result of their bigotry or stupidity"
c8b224f,,"Well, that particular incident with the threat of being shot was in Bath. But I've experienced verbal abuse on the street for holding hands with my partner many times in many places, and innumerable 'mucky looks'. I'm not a confrontational person, so personally I would rather prefer not be threatened with violence or death when I'm trying to go about my life. How often do you see gay couples holding hands in the streets? The truth is very few actually dare to do it because they know they will be subjected to harassment. Straight people are often so naive about what LGBT people have to go through on a day-by-day basis. It's not even just when with my partner that I receive verbal abuse, and it's not just from young men who are trying to look big in front of their knuckledragging friends (though that does describe most of them). I get anxious when in the city centre on Friday and Saturday nights because I know that LGBT people have been attacked on the streets here before and I worry that I will be victimized. As I said, I'm not a confrontational person and I'm quite short and not muscular, which marks me out as a target. People looking for a fight can pick up on something as minor as a badge or wristband as happened in Leeds in 2010. [This article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11831556) describes some of the more violent gay-bashings that have taken place in recent years. Even aside from those physically violent events, if you'd listened to the parliamentary debate on gay marriage, you'd understand that 'not really caring' is absolutely not how many adults feel about LGBT people - we were being slandered and defamed by many of the MPs who are supposed to represent us as citizens on Tuesday. All this is in the UK, a fairly socially liberal country. In many places it is far worse. Please don't be naive and trivialize what LGBT people go through. My coming-out resulted in my parents making me homeless. I'm far from alone."
c8aalni,falcon_jab,"> spouses have performed between themselves in a human fashion a conjugal act which is suitable in itself for the procreation of offspring, to which marriage is ordered by its nature and by which the spouses become one flesh.What if one of the partners is infertile? Does that then mean the marriage isn't consummated. Or even wearing a condom would surely mean there's no consummation?It all seems a bit, well, weird. So basically, when you get married, there is an unspoken implication> And now you are married, husband and wife. You must now henceforth go from this place and stick bits of thyself in thine significant other so thou canst maketh a tiny screaming child. Thou dost not wishest to make a child? Then thy is bang out of thy luck."
c8ab6qx,philthehumanist,"Not really. The religious law is specifically to protect the husband from the wife. If she will not have sex with him (or he claims as such) then he can annul the entire Marriage. That way you ensure a progressive, fair and free society that's perfectly happy."
c8ax6d6,,"The idea of consummation being a legal requirement in this day and age is utterly preposterous. Unless I missed the memo, I don't think straight couples are having their genitals medically examined to make sure they can 'consummate' and they aren't being recorded on hidden camera to make sure they do the deed. It's completely and utterly ridiculous that anyone is even having this debate, and I would bet money that most annulments based on non-consummation are just couples fibbing for a quick and easy divorce."
c8a50m1,DrellVanguard,"My parents got divorced without either of them having sex with another person, they just stopped wanting to be married?"
c8a4080,Slanderous,"Nonsense, they're all wearing suspenders under those dressing-gown getups.edit: allow me to elaborate: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q80ElML7KGk"

c89zbu1,honeypuffz,con**gay**ulations UK! :P
c89vm7x,slowreddit,What is next though? It's not yet legal though is it. Who else has to vote on it?
c89vpfj,Thundermead,"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/marriagesamesexcouplesbill.html Shows its path through parliament, and goes into greater detail about the bill itself! :)"
c89vtq3,slowreddit,I couldn't make heads or tails of that.
c89vwjg,Thundermead,"In a nutshell:The bill must go through 2 readings (votes) in the house of commons.Then through a committee and reviewsThen a final 3rd reading (vote)The same process is then repeated in the House of Lords.Afterwards, both houses vote on any amendments made by the other until both houses agree.It is then passed off for Royal Assent (read: Rubber stamped!)Hope that helps clear it up. I think I got it right! :)"
c89w34k,mcnicolls,"The first reading isn't a vote, just a formality still done through tradition. The bill is literally just read and nothing else."
c8a0kwu,Yaverland,"Not literally read. The fact of its existence is acknowledged and formally entered into the books without debate, and a date given for second reading debate and vote (by which point it must be published). The bill technically doesn't even need to have been written, beyond its title, for first reading."
c89w74b,Thundermead,"Ah, thanks :) My mistake, wasnt entirely sure."
c89y0hs,towbot,don't they just read the title the first time and nothing else?
c89vxn6,slowreddit,Is it expected to pass all of that?When will it all be said and done with?
c89vypd,Thundermead,"I believe it shall. Ive read a few political commentators state that the overwhelming majority in the YES vote will make it difficult for the Lords to disagree with the whole thing, and I quite agree.Unsure on time limit, but I'd guess at before the end of the year. Maybe even quicker."
c89wnsb,boocrap,No matter what anyone says about the readings it is almost completely done there are very few bilsl with this level of support that are heavily amended. In many cases this could be up for debate however the sheer size of the majority puts this out of bounds.
c8ab2c2,Riffler,"In theory yes, but there's still the Lords. Prompted by the Bishops, the Lords killed off an assisted dying bill a few years back which had majority support in the Commons and the country as a whole.And it wasn't a manifesto pledge, so the Parliament Act can't be used."

c89vsks,slowreddit,Who are they? How are the expected to vote?
c89vutt,,They're like the US senate I guess. Except they're appointed rather than elected. From everything I've heard they're expected to stamp this without much debate.
c89w9sc,KarmaAndLies,"They aren't really like the US senate. The US senate is a shitty copy (that is highly dysfunctional). They're more likely to allow it to pass but make legal amendments to it. They're there for the UK's long term health, and they VERY rarely completely block bills outright, they just try to fix them so they don't suck. The HoL's interests seem to be national stability, business interests, and rights of the court/legal system."
c89x0yp,,"Right, then what would you compare them to if you were to put it into a one sentence comparison?I still think ""they're sorta like the US senate"" is ""accurate enough"" for a quick description to help someone understand."
c89x4dq,KarmaAndLies,"> Right, then what would you compare them to if you were to put it into a one sentence comparison? *The Court of Common Council* but for the country. > I still think ""they're sorta like the US senate"" is ""accurate enough"" for a quick description to help someone understand. Meh. The main issue is that the US senate is elected. It might seem like a subtle difference but actually it makes a MASSIVE change to the dynamics of the place."
c89vz6y,slowreddit,"I love how I get mixed responses. You tell me they will stamp it without much debate, and someone else tells me they are against it."
c89w0ip,Thundermead,"Was that me you were referring to? I think they'll stamp it without debate (in a broad sense of the word), for the record! Ha, didn't mean to confuse you."
c89w4pw,mcnicolls,"Passing the bill through the Lords wont be a problem though, due to the Salisbury Convention!"
c89wowx,SEMW,"> the Salisbury Convention...only applies to manifesto commitments, which this isn't."
c89wo9i,boocrap,"Sailsbury Act, and that's mostly used as a threat."
c89xbfs,SEMW,"> Sailsbury ActDon't confuse the Parliament Acts and the Salisbury Convention, they're different.The Salisbury convention says that the Lords won't block manifesto legislation. It's just a convention (so it doesn't have legal force), and is irrelevant here because gay marriage wasn't a manifesto promise. The Parliament Acts, on the other hand, do have legal force, and let the Commons pass a bill that's been stalled for over a year (because the Lords have blocked it) without having to go through the Lords."
c89we34,blueb0g,This is pretty much it. It'll be law by 2014. It's passed the important steps.
c89wf0v,slowreddit,What is your opinion on the comment section of the Daily Mail:http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2273546/Gay-marriage-vote-Same-sex-weddings-make-society-stronger-claims-David-Cameron.html
c89x1hi,JimmerUK,"Oh Christ, why did I even read them. I feel stupider for having done so."

c8aa88r,querkmachine,"Funnily he actually got it the wrong way around the first time, then had to correct himself."
c8a3huf,penguinturtlellama,"That's disgusting. Not because of how hateful it is, because it is so cliché. I mean, c'mon, if you're going to be homophobic, at the very least, have the sense to be witty. At that point you're just offending everyone with a brain."
c89wnmc,friesahoy,"Before I read it, I'm going to say they're all hateful bigots who the world could do without. Source: They read and comment on the Daily Mail.Having checked, I was right. I did forget one thing though - those brave few commenters valiantly trying to make a decent point, or change some minds, who attract negative votes like honey does ants."
c89xio4,,"Somehow the comment ""Ha ha ha"" has a rating of 76... and ""Where do all these anti-gay marriage people come out of the woodwork from? Seriously does anyone have ANY decent argument against gay marriage?"" is at minus 252...>:people losing their homes jobs no prospects in the future money being given away like there is no tomorrow to the EU and overseas aid Troops being killed is some far away country and what are the MPs worried about not even their expenses . But gay marriage it really beggers believe .I can't even comprehend the stupid"
c89ymc7,Feint1,"That last point is a fair one. This whole thing is a distraction.Gay marriage was not part of the Conservative manifesto and there was no real campaign calling for its implementation, so there's no mandate. This is just a disastrous attempt to modernise the Conservative party. Cameron decided the Tories were looking too out-of-date in this progressive age so it'd be best to support a hip new law in an attempt to win over hip young voters. Unfortunately he chose a really divisive issue that ended up showing the party for what it is, a collection of old people that don't really like this bill at all.Cameron has made the situation worse, this is a monumental failure of a PR stunt."

c8a0zix,DoorsofPerceptron,If you don't like being called a bigot you should stop being bigoted. Gay people getting married will make no difference to your traditional marriage.
c8a12xi,Feint1,This bill redefines what marriage means. It destroys the traditional concept of marriage.
c8a2x4a,nllanki,"Traditional marriage is constantly being redefined. My understanding is that the first legal prohibitions against homosexuality began to appear around the 4th century.An advocate gave me an interesting titbit today. The earliest reference in Latin literature to a marriage between men occurs in the Philiccs of Cicero, who insulted Mark Antony for being a slut in his youth until Curio ""established you in a fixed and stable marriage (matrimonium), as if he had given you a stola""- the traditional garment of a married woman.That's of course ignoring recent changes around not marrying minors, divorce and some such."
c8a174e,DoorsofPerceptron,Anyone that wants a traditional marriage can still have one.It's not like people are going to have a gay marriage instead of a traditional one just because the option is there.Edit: Letting people get married in registry offices was more of a threat to traditional church marriages than gay marriage ever will be.
c8a8d4m,mountainfail,How?
c8aa8zv,Blastface,No it destroys the RELIGIOUS concept of marriage the concept of two people declaring their love for one another still exists. Marriage was a thing long before religion.
c8abgl3,sennalvera,Honestly? I think divorce did more to 'destroy' marriage than this proposed change ever will. I'd even go so far as to suggest that 'traditional' marriage no longer exists. Society is so radically different now and marriage (among many other things) has changed as a consequence of that.
c8a0s7e,,">Calling everyone that disagrees with you bigoted is a very bigoted thing to do.I don't think that's true at all on this issue. As a gay man, I completely support you in your defence of ""traditional"" marriage; if you're against same-sex marriage then don't marry someone of the same-sex. That simple. Those who oppose gay marriage however, attempt to rob me and the rest of the LGBT community of our personal rights, despite the fact that it has absolutely no bearing on their individual rights (or lives, for that matter). It's an attempt to force your personal (possibly religious?) convictions onto the rest of the country. That is bigotry."
c8a2ruj,nllanki,"I live in Doncaster. Ex-mining town with an English Democrat Mayor (well until today). I know nobody under 65 that oppose gay marriage. And these older lot are not the hateful type, just the confused set in their ways. And even that's a minority as they've openly gay grandkids and nieces or nephews. I honestly don't see the issue as divisive to anyone but the tory hardcore.In the past being gay was something to be ashamed of. It created a perverse culture, with things such as cottaging that fostered such regressive beliefs that homosexuals could never love or commit like we could. Thankfully society, and consequently gay culture has moved on. Some of the older generation haven't experienced this awakening so still harbour antiquated beliefs."
c8a89sp,mountainfail,"I'm a married man. What, in your opinion, would two people of the same sex getting married do to any way undermine your view of traditional marriage?Because I really can't think of anything.I *can* think of lots of positive things, such as two people being able to formally recognise their love and commitment on an equal footing as that of other couples... Which is a good thing, surely?"

c8adp6g,hp0,There is also another reason. Gay marriage if it is not passed in this parliment will be an issue in the next election. If cammaron tjen tries to make it a mannifesto promise odds are the oppisite will happen. So he would be forced to fight the next election with labour prommising it. And his party prolly forcing him to promise to ban it. Better to get the fight over while he can.
c8ae8tr,Feint1,"If Cameron had ignored the issue like most people we wouldn't be in this situation. Gay marriage hasn't been an issue since civil marriages came into effect and Labour had no intention of pushing for gay marriage in 2015.

Once that is done, I'd wager Scotland will have the legislation enacted quicker, as the House of Lords can't put the brakes on.Bear in mind England still doesn't let Humanists conduct weddings."
c89wmxr,RexManningDay,"> Bear in mind England still doesn't let Humanists conduct weddingsThat's not true at all. Most weddings are conducted by wedding celebrants and registrars, not vicars. Religious weddings are in the minority."

You can have a [humanist ceremony in England, but you still have to go get married by someone else as well.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanist_officiant).That said, there is legislation afoot for England and Wales.EDIT: You are of course right about religious weddings being a minority."
c8a9srr,oofy_prosser,"That's also true if you are catholic, Sikh, Muslim, etc. it's only Anglican weddings that include the legal bit. They're not just singling out atheists and humanists. Edit: Turns out this is wrong. Ignore it, please. I think all the weddings of other religions I've been to must have just not had their buildings registered for weddings."
c8aa51l,roomyn,"The [Marriage Act 1836](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act_1836), which introduced civil marriages, also allowed any religious group (I think?) to register marriages (the Church of England, the Quakers, and synagogues were already allowed to). As far as I know, that is still the case, which is why humanist groups are [always complaining](http://humanism.org.uk/campaigns/marriage-laws/) about not being allowed to register marriages:> People wishing to get married in England or Wales all have a choice if they wish of a register office ceremony, which by law must not be distinctive of any religion or belief, including Humanism. Only the religious have the additional option of a ceremony conducted according to their own religious beliefs. Although humanist celebrants conduct many weddings every year, these have no legal validity and have to be supplemented by a register office ceremony."
c8acb72,oofy_prosser,"Wow. Where the hell did I get the info that only anglican marriages are legal? Sounds like my information is good, but 200 years out of date.Either that or I've just completely invented something and decided it was fact. Anyway, thanks for telling me that.

c89yvgc,Audiovore,"Hmm, so I skimmed the Scottish Parliment wiki, and am slightly confused. What I gather, it seems to me that the SP is like a US State Legislature in relation to the Federal one?If that is so, if Scotland were to pass gay marriage first, wouldn't still be failed to be recognized by the UK government, and still be lacking in certain benefits(as State gay marriages lack Federal benefits)?And lastly, could an amendment be added to this bill to fix the Equalities Act conflict?"
c89zivd,Generallysceptical,"It's slightly more complicated because the legal systems of England and Scotland are completely separate, rather than one superseding the other. If Scotland made gay marriage legal, then that would be that and it would come with whatever benefits were written into law.The problem is that there are UK laws which the Scottish parliament doesn't have the powers to directly alter. The problem here is that if a Church of Scotland minister, for example, refused to carry out a same-sex wedding they could be charged with discrimination under the current law. No one really wants to make religious figures refusal illegal, so the law needs changed. This could either be done for the whole of the UK, or by introducing specific legislation in Scotland.Stating exemption from UK laws without potentially oversteps the remit of the Scottish parliament depending on the subject, so they basically need to sit down and have a chat. It would be messy to push through Scottish legislation if the UK law is away to change anyway."
c8a0bcl,Audiovore,"You say England and Scotland are completely separate, but there is no 'English Parliment', just the UK, and are there not Scottish MPs in Parliament in London? From what I read, the new Scottish Parliament didn't do away with the Acts of Union, it just created a lower level body with limited authority.And if Scotland passed it, and it 'came with whatever benefits were written into law', would that mean a foreign national could marry a UK national in Scotland, and then apply for the appropriate marriage/resident visas with the UK government? Or would that have to be explicitly written in the Scotland law, and the UK government forced to accept it?"
c8a24zn,mojojo42,"Devolution did not dissolve the Act of Union; that, if it were done, would be done by an independence referendum. As it stands the Scottish Government has responsibility for those powers that weren't reserved by Westminster (primarily things like taxation and defence).So the legislature is currently semi-separate (there's a hierarchy in areas where they overlap), however the legal system itself has always been entirely distinct (e.g., an admission of guilt isn't sufficient evidence to convict in Scotland, it must always be corroborated by a second source).As such you can end up with a complicated series of overlapping laws - something might be legal in Scotland, unrecognised by the UK, recognised by the ECHR, etc (or the reverse: Scotland's smoking ban was introduced a year before England - so the same action was legal in one country but not in another).In terms of residency, that is an area that is currently reserved by Westminster - the foreign national would have a marriage that was legal in Scotland, was unrecognised in the rest of the UK (England+Wales+NI), and as such would not make a difference to UK residency."

c8aacon,filioqueclause,"From a legal perspective his question has merit (though I suspect he was voting on 'moral', ie bigoted, grounds as opposed to legalistic) - due to current divorce/annulment law, gay sex (of any kind) doesn't count as adultery or consummation. Those are important as they're so-called 'grounds for divorce' that permit a divorce or an annulment. So technically there is something to be discussed there if 'gay divorce rights' are to be the same as everyone else's.But that's the point of amendments and of committee stages, and failing that, the judiciary. Let's get gay marriage sorted before we get worried about gay divorce! (And besides, most divorces are done on grounds of 'circumstances' these days, which can easily be legally used by a gay married couple who wish to divorce because one of them was unfaithful - one bizarre footnote to all this is that in a current straight marriage, it's never legally counted as adultery if a man has sex with another man.)"
c8aaes3,DoorsofPerceptron,">From a legal perspective his question has merit I really don't think it does. At least not in this debate.Annulment on the grounds of no consummation is hardly ever used, and with the existence of no fault divorces, it's not really needed.The legal definition of adultery might need fixing, but as you say, that's a separate problem both for gay and straight marriages and the judiciary already have workarounds.

That is an unconsummated marriage is no marriage at all, if the couple don't intend to conceive and raise children together then it's deficient.Clearly now marriage is to be re-defined in these new certain terms procreation is to be excluded as an issue. The only consistent way to follow through is to remove the need for consummation as an element of marriage, opposite sex couples can't consummate a marriage. The conclusion then is that sexual behaviour is not an element of marriage either. Anyone surely should then be allowed to ""marry"" anyone else of any age. Moreover why should there be a prohibition under such a regime to recognising multiple partnerships; the only reason I see are financial (ie you share your partnership right to pension with the 50 members of your family you're ""married"" to, if you die then the pension company is getting a big bill [or just definitely getting a bill] if they didn't carefully allow for this situation in their contracts).So surely all the current activists for equality will be pushing through more primary legislation next year to allow anyone to label themselves as ""married""."

What a negative view of it. I'm glad you are not responsible for defining what is a marriage. That two people do not want children in no way makes their marriage ""deficient"".If the law says ""you **must** consummate your marriage for it to be official"", then what law? That it can be voided (not annulled, there's a difference) on grounds of lack of consummation does not mean consummation is a requirement. As has been raised in this thread, the law (if passed) will remove any consummation requirement from same sex couples, making the argument null anyway.The rest is just tin hat. 'Marriage' is just the legal joining of two people, currently of opposite sexes. You may have this notion of romance and love and consummation, but the reality is I, a male, could grab any consenting random woman and marry her in a registrar's office as long as we can drum up some witnesses and she is of legal age. We would not be obligated to have children, or even have sex. But in the law, we'd be married. You're free to disagree with that on moral grounds, but that doesn't alter it. Same-sex marriage doesn't diminish that, it simply allows same-sex couples equality."
c8aaqqm,roomyn,"> As has been raised in this thread, the law (if passed) will remove any consummation requirement from same sex couples, making the argument null anyway.This part of the bill is rather silly in my opinion (not that I disagree with the rest of what you said). As I understand it, consummation specifically requires penis-in-vagina sex. However, many married couples in which at least one person has a disability or medical condition, is very elderly, or is intersex or transgender or asexual, will never perform this sex act. A minority of same-gender married couples (involving a trans or intersex person) will. To me, the obvious thing to do is to take consummation out of the law. But then, I suppose this would give the Catholics ammunition to say that ""traditional"" marriage is being damaged to appease LGBT people."

I searched for it, but found nothing.The law is clear that lack of consummation can be grounds for voiding the marriage.

It also says that you can get an annulment at any time, whereas you have to wait a year before you can get divorced.

c89xffk,Green_Army,"As someone unlikely to vote for the Tories, i'm actually impressed that Cameron still backed this despite the amount inside his party who opposed it. Perhaps looking to the election and the growth of UKIP, could we possibly see some defections from disgruntled very conservative Conservatives unhappy with Cameron and where 'their' party is going?"
c89xtie,bacon_cake,"Kinda makes me support Cameron a bit more.Then again, it gives leverage to the argument that the UK is facing a ""presidential"" style shift."
c89xxwm,Green_Army,"There's definitely a parallel between the old style Conservatives and Republicans who are getting disgruntled that the world has moved on from their old fashioned views. Seeing the more progressive Tories support bills like this make me wonder if we'd be better off if rather than getting blurred by party lines, that if the more progressive Tories worked more with the generally more progressive members of Labour and the Lib Dems who are generally a more progressive party (just they've always lacked the power). Though it won't happen, and we'll be left with the usual situation of party politics and infighting getting in the way of what is right."
c8a4bhd,will_holmes,"The ideal solution is that the old style Conservatives leave and make their own party (or assimilate into UKIP) so the political spectrum is better represented in Westminster. That way the progressive Tories would have to get into coalitions, and they'd be reasonably proportioned.Then again, it's a split of the right, so there would have to be a very good reason to do it."

c89xq3e,G_Morgan,I think he'd never have raised it if he had the chance. As it is to back down now will make the Tories look silly.
c89y2nh,ColdHotCool,"Exactly, Cameron did a political gaff, but you can't shut the stable door after the horse has bolted, he either had to be a progressive conservative in going for gay marriage, or be slated in the newspapers and polls when the lib dems and labour voted it though.He chose the worst of all options available to him. He wouldn't be too bad a Prime minister if only he got rid of that lacky osbourne, I can stand Cameron and would probably vote for his party if he was in charge, but Osbourne is such egit I'd vote against them purely on that basis."
c8adcqr,NotEdHarris,"Part of me thinks its a deliberate move by Cameron to gently purge the more socially regressive elements from the party and dump them on UKIP. The demographic that likes that sort of thing is dying out and the chances are that they're going to be out on their arse at the next election, so it's as good a time as any to do a bit of clearing out, shed the ""nasty party"" image.It might take a term or so in opposition but it's probably in the party's interest long-term."
c8a2jtj,JimmyNic,"Politically it's a pretty bizarre move from Cameron, by my reckoning. I can't really see this cultivating a huge number of Tory votes next election because most of the champions of gay marriage will be too anti-Tory for this to make a difference. Then again his modus operandi has been that of modernisation, so maybe this is intended for that effect, in which case I've a feeling he's going to be disappointed. If this had come later in his term it would be more plausible that it's just a ""fuck it"" moment from him, but the likelihood is that if he thought this would really damage his chances next election he'd have quietly tabled it for next Parliament. However much the backbenchers and right-wingers piss and moan at him, the truth is there is no serious alternative leader that they can rally around."

Why do we need gay marriage when we already have civil partnership, they say. They are the same - separate but equal - they claim. Let me speak frankly - separate but equal is a fraud. Separate but equal is the language that tried to push Rosa Parks to the back of the bus. Separate but equal is the motif that determined that black and white people could not possibly drink from the same water fountain, eat at the same table or use the same toilets. It is an excerpt from the phrasebook of the segregationist and the racists. This is not separate but equal it is separate and discriminated, separate and oppressed, separate and brow beaten, separate and subjugated. Separate is not equal so let us be rid of it."""

c89w3vo,KarmaAndLies,"> That's 175 people who don't believe in equal rights. IF you had watched the debate you'd know that that isn't why many of them voted against it. There are many reasons why they felt this new law wasn't required: - They were unhappy with the legal protections/wanted more consolation on it (some lawyers have expressed concern that even with the so-called ""quadruple lock"" the courts could challenge it). - Many of them who voted FOR the civil union bill felt that they got double-crossed (since at the time they were assured that the civil union bill was as far as this would go, marriage would remain ""protected""). They are concerned that they might get double-crossed again (that the CoE/religion exemptions might be removed in the future). - Some wanted marriage to remain between a man and a women but wanted to expand civil partnerships to straight couples (for equality, or something). - Some felt that there were more important issues, even in equality (e.g. women in the House of Lords) and that this issue was both unimportant and because it wasn't in a manifesto that it wasn't a democratic change. - Concerns were raised that essentially the law would only change the name of the thing, and needed a lot of work in order to cover historical legal problems (and maybe to automatically convert Civil Unions into Gay Marriages, since Civil Unions were now redundant). - et al My point is, that if you watched the debates you might disagree with the opposition to this reform (as I myself do) but you cannot just paint them all with the ""bigot who hates equality"" brush as so many are quick to do. Some of them are bigots. Some of them don't care about equality. But there are a LOT of legitimate questions and concerns about this particular bill/law/legal change and frankly it HAS been rushed through."
c89wf5m,Lessiarty,"The second, third and fourth ones still smack of general ill-ease with equality to me. If one were for equality, how could this be a double-crossing? It's only a double crossing if you begrudgingly ceded some ground to the homosexual community in the hopes they'd stop there. If one were to insist marriage is between a man and a woman, they're still putting up that blockade to equality and if one were to fob it off as unimportant to the extent that they couldn't even hold a vote on it (yet would happily participate in debates about why they should not hold a vote for it... unimportance built upon unimportance?)... that speaks volumes all on it's own.So yes, there were probably some people who had their reasoned stands on why this isn't the time or the place for this decision, but I find it hard to swallow that they were in any way the majority of the votes against."
c89wjoa,KarmaAndLies,"> The second, third and fourth ones still smack of general ill-ease with equality to me. There is definitely the undertones of that in a lot of the debate/argument. For example one MP compared this bill to legalising polygamy and inter-family marriages, which got a gasp from the chamber and they were still talking shit about that remark over an hour later. I just wanted to make the point about, that while SOME of the people voting against it are bigots, you should be careful with calling *everyone* one. Some of the arguments against are more complex than ""gay people suck"" ""they don't deserve equal rights."" In fact from many of their perspective's gay people already have ""equal"" rights (legally). > If one were for equality, how could this be a double-crossing? Double crossed in the sense that government removes the CoE and ""voluntary"" exemptions from it later (years from now). Essentially making it required for all churches to perform gay marriages. It is paranoid as fuck, but from their perspective this happened before (with this bill, since civil partnerships was sold to many as the be-all-end-all of legal equality for gay people)."

This exemption is now contained in paragraph 18(1) of schedule 9 of the Equality Act 2010.>In other words, the law currently allows occupational pension schemes to disregard pension benefits (other than guaranteed minimum pension benefits) earned before 5 December 2005 when assessing what should be paid on the death of a worker to that person's surviving civil partner.>Although some pension schemes have voluntarily decided to go further than this and include pre-December 2005 benefits when assessing a surviving civil partner's entitlement to such benefits, many schemes have simply adopted the minimum legal position.>However, the Government has stated in its consultation paper on equal civil marriages that survivor benefits in occupational pension schemes is an area that needs further consideration.>It said that the Department for Work and Pensions is considering whether the law (which only requires equality from 2005) should be retained and the impact of its removal or modification.>Let's hope that ministers do take this opportunity to clarify this area because it appears that this is yet another area of potential discrimination employers and private pension schemes may need to address.[Source](http://www.legalweek.com/legal-week/analysis/2189472/-sex-marriage-consultation-chance-clarify-pension-benefits-civil-partners)The hope was that the new legislation would correct this.

Nor does it seem anyone is arguing for that correction which is such an obvious inequality within the framework being discussed that it's omission really stands out. Why is that?Couples of opposite sex who wished to have a civil partnership are still excluded from civil-partner pension benefits.Now that the Commons have decided that marriage is to be dissociated from family life and is no longer to be supported for any [perceived or actual] benefits towards societal support of parents there seems to be no logical reason to exclude any pairing from (or perhaps group) from marriage.""Marriage"" within families should now also be allowed as the incest argument (that procreation within families should be avoided) is no longer valid if marriage is no-longer to have any [or at least a central] element of supporting and affirming parents. IMO the government can't logically stop at this position unless the reason for the bill is to simply punish those who hold marriage in high regard and adhere to the traditional family unit as a basis for building a properly functioning society. Now assuming this to be ratified there appears no argument against any form of partnership coming under the governments legal definition of marriage. That would IMO have to include partnerships with no element of sexual relationship and for any reason limited only by the conscience of the parties involved. Multiple partners of any configuration should be recognised.Of course this won't happen because no one is pushing this on the basis of true equality: if that were the actual aim the very simple action would have been to say ""this government will no longer care if anyone is married"" and drop all government activity as it relates to marriage."
c89x6m7,cockblockingteats,It was pass through lords despite the Tory peers & bishops but not before they have tried to butcher it.
c89yjbv,hotcod,">hey were unhappy with the legal protections/wanted more consolation on it (some lawyers have expressed concern that even with the so-called ""quadruple lock"" the courts could challenge it).This is bullshit and here's why.They say that some faiths *might* by law be forced to marry people they don't want to if this bill passes. So instead they want the law to remain the same, a law that makes it *illegal* for faiths to marry gay couples even if they want to recognize that marriage as marriage.**The law is ALREADY defining marriages for faiths and is ALREADY suppressing the religious freedoms of those faiths at the behest of other faiths.**But that's ok is it? We are meant to just forget that and look away because they prefer their faiths homophobic unequal view of marriage because they might, just maybe, but probably not at all be forced to treat people equally? Because it's so very clear that gay couples would just *love* to get married in a church that doesn't want them their because they would be just *wonderful*. They are children whining about how unfair it will be that they might have done to them what they are already doing to others. It makes me sick. Fuck them. The goal of this bill is not to force anything on faiths but to remove the very real restrictions of the freedom of other faiths and to grant equality and to allow equal people to call an equal thing the same. To use ""suppression of faith"" as grounds to oppose that is hypercritical."
c89wf0x,confusedpublic,">But there are a LOT of legitimate questions and concerns about this particular bill/law/legal change and frankly it HAS been rushed through.Procedural question, I guess. Won't most of/some of these issues be addressed at the committee stage? This is the first vote on the bill, no amendments etc. where a lot of these issues should be addressed, no?Also, the point that it wasn't in a manifesto is tosh, given how little regard the parties seem to give their manifestos after a year or two, and that if the parties rigidly stuck to their manifestos they would never be able to pass legislation in reaction to events (taking the position to a logical, ridiculous conclusion): no war in your manifesto, no voting on going to a country attacking us, etc. (This is also a tongue in cheek point, don't respond to it seriously hah)"
c89wzru,CaptainFil,The manifesto argument doesn't hold water. We elect representatives who are supposed to use their own judgement when voting on cross party issues. The manifesto is like a catalogue of wants you can use as a guide but it is not the be all and end all.
c89wrya,DukePPUk,"I caught some of the debate in Parliament, and saw only the first of those arguments raised. The other arguments were ""marriage is between a man and a woman and we shouldn't mess with that."" Or ""this is being rushed through and the lawyers aren't sure about it.""I also caught some of the speeches in favour, including one which semi-demolished the first argument by pointing out that *if* the Courts (particularly the ECHR) were going to interfere with equality in the Church of England, we'd have women bishops already.The problem I have with most of the arguments against equal marriage is that they come across not as evidence-based positions, but excuses. For example, one of the solutions to it being rushed is to discuss it in detail in committee (after second reading). Similarly, the problem as to the precise legal scope can also be dealt with at committee/report, or in the Lords (not that this always works out).As a second reading debate, the vote today was on the *principle* of the Bill, not the text; so arguments against would seem to be, in principle, against equal marriage, and thus against equality."
c89wvib,KarmaAndLies,"> The problem I have with most of the arguments against equal marriage is that they come across not as evidence-based positions True, but neither side provided evidence based positions.

c89x8nk,DukePPUk,"> either side provided evidence based positions.Welcome to Westminster politics... In my experience it operates on the ""come up with a position, then find any evidence which supports it"" principle, rather than the scientific ""let's look at the existing evidence, come up with a hypothesis, test it/try to disprove it/come up with alternatives and only if it survives, go with it"" approach.> That doesn't allow the MPs who voted it against it today to take part.As far as I'm aware there is nothing preventing MPs who voted against the second reading being on the Bill Committee; typically Committees consist of members of the various parties who are the ""experts"" in the relevant field, so I imagine some anti-equal-marriage people will be on it (unless they take it through the Committee of the Full House).House of Lords committees are slightly different; technically they are open to anyone, but (iirc) traditionally are limited to whoever spoke at the second reading.Obviously it will take a couple of days to be sorted out, but details of the Public Bill Committee for the Marriage bill should appear on the left side of [the Bill's page](http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2012-13/marriagesamesexcouplesbill.html) at Parliament.uk."
c89wyyp,hashbangperl,"Pretty much every argument I heard against was a sementic fig-leaf for bigotry or a strawman.Marriage has always evolved, we no longer marry off our daughters against their will for political or financial gain, nor able to sell our wives, nor have sexual relations with our spouse against their will, nor do husbands control the wives finances, nor are any of the female MPs voting against the bill bound to ""honour and obey"" their husbands.The ""children"" arguments are also complete bollocks and they know it, one MP conceded that his argument was about ""a definition from hundreds of years ago"" when challenged about his going to the wedding of a fellow MP who was too old for child-rearing.The quibblings over future changes are also a red herring, the worst case scenario is that ""deeply held faith"" or bigotry would result in blessings being held in church but the legal registry part is done in a seperate secular ceremony - nobody will force them to bless marriages in church for gay couples."

c89xxi5,hotcod,Today I learnt about marital coercion today thanks to the news. Do you know that until the 1920's if a women was found to have committed a crime in front of her husbands it was simply presumed that the husband had force her into doing it? It's been changed since then but not 100 years ago we presumed that a women couldn't have agency with in a marriage. That's is not marriage as we commonly know it today.

Most of the opposition arguments are weak at best (more important issues, tarnishing the sanctity of marriage etc).

No one cares about how rushed these laws are - enough is enough. None of your points represents a reasonable critique against immediate equality before the law."
c8a4fus,09112001,"""Equal rights"" is misleading... a gay man can still marry a woman like everyone else, it's just his preference that is now being legalized.Will the legalization of polygamous and incestual marriage also be called ""equal rights""?(note - I am not against gay marriage, or polygamous/incest for that matter)."
c8a9x5e,tusksrus,>since Civil Unions were now redundantAre they?
c8aafq1,KarmaAndLies,Yes. Gay marriage grants slightly more rights and fixes a small handful of issues that Civil Unions broke (although gay marriage breaks things too!). There is no value in getting a Civil Union when a Marriage is available.
c89ynvm,RexManningDay,"There's a simple test for them on these incredibly weak attempts to hide their bigotry.

c89wiel,giraffemoustache,"I think that it's also worth remembering that while this is an amazing step in the right direction (it's almost like it's the 21st century...), equal marriage =/= equality.While this will hopefully translate into legal equality with regards to marriage, it won't instantly end discrimination. Let's view this as a step forward (an important one), but not the end goal."
c8a1bk7,,"I understand what you're saying, but this really is the last step in legal terms towards LGB equality. The discrimination you talk about is infinitely harder to quantify and, I'm sad to say, will probably take a couple of generations to go away."

And I'm sure that making marriage equal will help to change those attitudes.Don't get me wrong- I think it's bloody fantastic that same sex marriage will be legal soon, (and I hope that it really does make all unions equal in the eyes of the law) and great that we're able to finally make it happen."
c89wo78,KarmaAndLies,"I agree. I do think that having gay marriage does help combat discrimination a little, since now, at least in the eyes of the law there is no difference between a straight and gay couple - even by name alone.

Thought my views might help some of the people here understand what kind of people think same sex marriage is a step backwards, not forwards.I am against same sex not because I'm a homophobe, I have and know great people who are in gay relationships, but because to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of years. Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absent.Two people who love each other is awesome, but its something else completely different, and should remain separate. I thought Civil Partnership, that gave gay couples **exactly the same** rights than married couples (with the exception of division of wealth in case of divorce, in my eyes a bonus!) was a healthy balance and most of people were happy, **but politicians, in an effort to divide us** and taking attention away of more important issues, like cutting down HUGE gap, and growing, between the poor and the rich."
c8a0rzg,TheSitarHero,"Let's take this apart shall we?> to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of yearsCheck your Eurocentrism. Indigenous cultures even up to the present day haven't defined marriage in such a way. The nuclear family is not a concrete social structure that humans are bound by some 'human nature' to fall into, it is a socially constructed phenomenon, and can be changed. If you want to try and call it religiously motivated, the Bible doesn't actually define marriage this way, with notable examples of polygamy and basically a lack of rights for the woman in a marriage. This is not how we see marriage today, so marriage has changed; the 'foundation' of man + woman still a recent development, as before it was more 'man dominating woman'.>Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absentWhat does this have to do with same-sex marriage? You say that 'married couples with kids' are more likely to stay together than non-married couples. However, this seems to be an argument **in favour** of same-sex marriage, as you haven't given statistics for married couples without kids, or even non-married couples with children. Besides, while there's still obstacles, gay and lesbian couples can adopt or have their own biological children by other means, so your argument doesn't follow. Neither does your statistic about people in jail coming from broken families. If broken families cause jail sentences, then surely this supports same-sex marriage as children of these families will have two parents. Unless of course you were suggesting that a same-sex couple couldn't raise a child as well as a mixed-sex couple? Didn't you say you *weren't* a homophobe?>I thought Civil Partnership, that gave gay couples exactly the same rights than married couples (with the exception of division of wealth in case of divorce, in my eyes a bonus!) was a healthy balance and most of people were happy, but politicians, in an effort to divide usYou do not get to define what is equality or progress for the LGBT community. They are they minority, and an oppressed one at that, and so they decide what's right for them and what they want to campaign for. Did you not notice the campaign and demonstrations by groups like Stonewall, LGBT activist groups, for the right to marry? 'most people' were not happy within the LGBT community, and they should not have the views of the majority imposed upon them. Politicians are not trying to divide with this legislation, they are trying to do the exact opposite and include a disadvantaged and oppressed group into a system that has neglected them until now. >and taking attention away of more important issues, like cutting down HUGE gap, and growing, between the poor and the rich.A few hours of debate did not stop progress on this, because it can't be solved in two hours debate. My views on the wealth gap aren't important here, but suffice it to say that it's not going to be fixed while the neoliberal Conservatives are in government. This represents some actual progress, and I welcome it. Welcome to the 21st Century."
c89yell,fezzuk,"ok so i guess we should not allow straight couple who can't/don't want to have kids get married then.secondly civil partnership although giving them the same rights by the very fact you insist on giving it a different name means that it is not equal but segregation.personally i do not want to get married because i think it is an out dated concept with to much baggage attached to the label, i would get a civil partner ship however under current laws i cannot because i am straight.and the idea that it is a diversion created to divide us is just crap, yes there are more important issues in the world but you could say that of almost anything and it is not an argument to not change the things we can."

It's an extreme example but your argument could reflect the fact that votes for women didn't exist anywhere until 1893, and that in thousands of years of recorded history before that women did not have that right. An anti suffrage person in the UK in 1915 probably took the same hand wringing position, that it was all moving too fast for them, but the reality is that the women's suffrage movement had been building to this for decades. I generally support the view of Mill that human liberty should extend so far that I can act in the way that pleases me, without it causing undue harm to you.

c89vv2t,Captain_Bassdaddy,Not sure why we're congratulating ourselves... this is no more of an achievement than holding open a door for someone. It's disgraceful that this is even an issue and I'm embarrassed to live in a society where people even think there's a case against it. The idea that gay marriage is *still* illegal in 2013 is obscene.
c89wflh,,"Oh, cheer up and be happy we've moved one step forward towards a better society.There's plenty of bullshit that will continue to make us embarrassed for years to come. Be happy we got this small thing done. When it completely passes then we can go back to being miserable about all the other stuff our country sucks at."
c89wgjq,Fineus,"Rights weren't won for black people, women, or other historically ""oppressed"" or ""minority"" groups until they were *fought for*. Whilst I'll agree that this shouldn't be an issue - I'd be glad to live in a time and that finally sees it taken care of - even if it's a long time coming. Better to be positive about this and get it sorted out, properly, I feel - than to complain that it didn't happen quickly enough. It finally *is* happening. Run with it."
c8a0gxm,Tven0,I have to agree with you. As a University student I understand that the Emancipation Proclamation in America did not end slavery. It made black people free in Confederate America but it not mean that everybody suddenly accepted them and would employ them. Lincoln passed the law but Congress did not.Black rights were fought for then like gay rights are being fought for now. The vote today by the House of Commons is one step forward in a larger game to make every citizen of the world free.
c89wp9l,BritishRedditor,"That's rather hyperbolic. This isn't apartheid-era South Africa.Same-sex couples in civil partnerships have had almost all the same rights as married couples for some time. There are plenty of people who believe in the religious definition of marriage while supporting the rights of gay people.As an atheist, I support the gay marriage bill unreservedly it doesn't surprise me at all that some people defend the traditional idea of marriage."
c89xbjs,CaptainFil,"But the "" traditional"" view of marriage has been hijacked by Christian revisionists. The original purpose of marriage was strategic political union"
c89yu2j,Ivashkin,"Not really. Marriage in European culture was quite often a case of property rights and bloodlines for non-politically invested people. The Christian involvement started in the early 2nd century when the idea of marriage being something done in the eyes of god rather than a private matter, and grew as a way of expanding the Churches influence. So Christianity has had a hand in marriage since the very early days of the faith, although it was simply adding to and codifying existing customs rather than developing something new."
c89wrmr,Captain_Bassdaddy,"The idea that religion still plays any role in the legal system is ridiculous. This entirely stems from homophobia, religion is a convenient excuse."
c89xha6,BritishRedditor,"> The idea that religion still plays any role in the legal system is ridiculous.Agreed, but my point concerns the origin of marriage, not the homophobia that's littered throughout the Bible. If someone believes that marriage is purely a religious ceremony, then I can understand why they would have an issue with same-sex marriages."
c89xjrn,Captain_Bassdaddy,"My point is more than they're picking and choosing what rules they want to follow. How many of the people who insist that they aren't homophobic yet are anti-gay marriage have also eaten shellfish or broken any of the other religious rules mentioned in the bible? These people only care about what suits their intolerant beliefs, not about actual religion."
c8a6ryc,pbhj,">*not the homophobia that's littered throughout the Bible* //The only ""homophobia"" I know of in the Bible is part of the Old Testament that refers to avoiding being raped. Could you give some references to where fear of homosexual acts is otherwise expressed in the Bible?"
c89yo8q,Ivashkin,"> The idea that religion still plays any role in the legal system is ridiculous.Until fairly recently the UK was a Christian nation and has been a largely majority Christian nation for well over 1500 years. It still technically is given that 59% of people marked Christian on the 2011 census. So the idea that a democratic nation with this history still has some laws with a basis in Christianity is far from ridiculous, especially since many of our cultural norms have a basis in Christianity even for non-believers (such as myself). > This entirely stems from homophobia, religion is a convenient excuse.No it isn't. Some people just don't feel that gay marriage is right, and many of these people have nothing against homosexuals at all. Even some homosexuals are against it. And regardless, in a free society they are entitled to hold the view that gay marriage is wrong. But all this aside, public opinion towards homosexuals has changed dramatically over the course of a century. Back in the 1950's gay men were being locked up or chemically castrated for being gay, and a mere 63 years later the leader of the Conservative party has championed the cause of giving homosexuals the right to marry. That's a huge amount of progress for a political party that was responsible for Section 28 25 years ago."
c8a6qnx,pbhj,">*The idea that religion still plays any role in the legal system is ridiculous.* //There is no religion, there are only religious people.The country currently is curbing democracy to exclude the opinions of religious people."
c8a6pbw,pbhj,>*The idea that gay marriage is still illegal in 2013 is obscene.* //It's no more illegal than falling away from a centre of gravity is. It's just not possible under definition of the term marriage. So what does a post-modernist society do when they feel discriminated against because of their own choices? Redefine away as encompassing toward and bingo anti-gravity.
c89y60o,hotcod,"Yes, it's obscene but a lot about life is obscene and if you are not going to celebrate the first steps towards rectifying that obscenity just because it's not the last one then you are refusing to show approval of progress and we need to keep showing that approval. A vast majority of our elected officials voted for this bill *that is a good thing* and it's worth making clear that we think that it's a *good thing* or they may start thinking it wasn't such a good thing when they are facing reelection. Do not let the minority voice be the only voice they hear in the coming weeks else them holding open the door will be as meaningless as you so wrongly presume it to be now."
c89ydoy,Captain_Bassdaddy,"I don't really celebrate things that are expected. I'm not saying this isn't a good thing, just that we shouldn't act like this is amazing. It's embarrassing that this is so worthy of celebration in the first place."

c89z6ah,Captain_Bassdaddy,I didn't say anything about not trying to change it. It's just that celebrating it as some kind of incredibly progressive step is absurd. It's just doing the obviously right thing.
c89z8fx,hotcod,"But it is incredibly progressive step, it's very *sad* that it is that we have to fight for these kind of obvious things but it's the reality.

c8aa65i,Crimsai,"But gay blood has all those sparkly bits in it!Does this affect us here in Northern Ireland? I seemed to keep seeing 'England and Wales' mentioned, no mention of us. Maybe cause we're too busy arguing about flags to care about actual things."
c8aay4b,roomyn,"It only legalises same-sex marriage in England and Wales. There are some relatively minor provisions that apply to the whole UK, such as allowing same-sex marriages in consulates and overseas military bases, and ensuring that same-sex marriages from one home nation will be recognised as civil partnerships in another (unless they have legalised it too). Scotland is also in the process of legalising it. There was a non-binding resolution in the NI Assembly calling for it to be legalised, but it failed to reach a majority, let alone cross-community support (it was supported by most SF and SDLP MLAs, some Alliance ones, and couple of UUP members)."

c89vlp2,ArtistEngineer,"Don't be too quick to judge. Not agreeing with gay marriage isn't the same as homophobia or bigotry. Many are probably religious and, as you know, the bible says ""no"" and this will never change. It's fundamental.I listened to some of the debate and many put forward that it ""didn't matter"" due to existing legislation recognising couples, and that it was not a significant issue at this point of economic crisis in the UK.Many votes against were probably because they had to spend the whole day debating this one topic.EDIT: I may not agree with what people have to say, but I will defend their right to say it."
c89vpm8,Flobblem,"Not wanting same sex couples to marry based on religious grounds is religious bigotry. It does not mean that every person who voted no is whole heartedly a despicable person and an irredeemable bigot, but it does mean that those people hold a bigoted view. Also if they voted no because they thought it was a waste of time then they *are* despicable people and terrible politicians."
c8a1vr9,arseache,"Sorry, to be against this bill does not = bigotry. I as a gay person would have voted against."
c8a22k3,Flobblem,I am interested to know why you would have voted against this bill.
c8a2mli,arseache,"It is not equality. A straight couple cannot get a civil partnership - and I know several who are not married for this reason. Why is this not being addresed?Marriage - and I know I come across like I'm a jesus-bothering nutjob here - IS between a man and a woman. It has always been promoted as something 'in the eyes of god'. We might have civil ceremonies in the UK, but it is still 'marriage' with all the religious/heterocentric baggage that word schlepps along with it. I don't want my same sex relationship bracketed with a legal entity that allowED a man to return to the father of his wife and demand the services of one of her female siblings if she turned out to be faulty (to cite one biblical law). Or that still requires a dowry (and is rarely a love match) in so many parts of the world. I'm sorry, but the word marriage has, for me, too many negative connotations. And, yes, I do know I am in a minority of my queer brethren on this one."
c8a2x1e,Flobblem,"I am never going to get married to a man or a woman as I disagree with the institution of marriage, but I do believe that if two people feel that they need to validate their love in the eyes of an invisible omniscient being then they should be able to do so no matter what sexuality they subscribe to. Honestly I agree with you about marriage, but just because I don't want one doesn't mean that people shouldn't be allowed them. Many LGBT people of faith want to get married. I don't know why, but I know that it is wrong to tell them they can't because they have the same genitals. I don't see any problem with allowing straight people to have civil partnerships, but the Tories using this as a defence is like someone from the KKK moaning about the black people not letting them drink from the 'blacks only' water fountain. Your view also ignores the fact that society's attitude towards marriage, and the concept of what marriage is has changed over time."
c8a92nz,arseache,"Well, everything you say is true. The current situation is a legal and actual mess and current legislation isnt gonna fix that. Why not overhaul all 'partnership' legislation so's no-one can get 'married' on the state, only civil partnered then allow all the churches of all the different shadesto offer the marriage. People would then be free to have god in on their act or not. They would still use the language of their choice too - many of my friends use words like weddingor wife now even though it's a civil partnership they had."
cav6c1o,Dmcv,"I know it's probably unnecessary to reply to a comment from 4 months ago, but I've just been reading the arguments here to educate myself a bit on the issue.I like yours and Flobblem's reasoned opinions, I agree with both of you. I initially found it strange, given there are pretty much the same rights and privileges afforded by civil partnerships and marriages, that anyone was bothered by the way things are. I thought people were just getting hung up on the semantics of ""marriage"".However, the way I see it now is that the main problem is that ""religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships""^[1] and that is ridiculous. If a religious same-sex couple wish to have their legal union blessed by a religious institution which is willing to do so, there should be no state law restricting their rights (the couple's or the institution's) to do so.I can't understand why 175 elected MPs failed to look at it this way. It is a massive restriction on freedom of religious expression.>Why not overhaul all 'partnership' legislation so's no-one can get 'married' on the state, only civil partnered then allow all the churches of all the different shades to offer the marriage.That sounds like a great idea to me.^[1] ^http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/family/marriage_and_civil_partnerships/500385.html"
c89vvv6,IKLYSP,"I think you're confusing Bigotry for bias here. Bigots are people who have a hatred or intolerance for a certain group of people. I don't believe any of them actively hate gays, they just have their own beliefs which causes them to be biased on what is right and wrong."
c89vz5v,bertolous,"So being intolerant of gay people is not bigotry? I bet if I openly admitted my intolerance of black people (not that I have one) and voted for repealing rights that non-blacks took for granted I would be called a bigot and worse. Their beliefs are irrelevant, its their actions they are being judged on."
c89w3ew,IKLYSP,"Having differing opinions does not necessarily mean intolerance. Clearly you shouldn't have a bias when in a position of power, but I think the word 'Bigot' is tossed around all too readily by people who do not know what it means."

c89w93d,bertolous,Not saying it is but when a different opinion leads someone to try and deny one section of society the rights that another section of society enjoy then that person is a bigot. Replace gay with black and see how that sounds.
c89w40d,RexManningDay,"> Bigots are people who have a hatred or intolerance for a certain group of people. I don't believe any of them actively hate gaysBut they're intolerant, and look down on gay people, as shown by their wish to render their relationships second class, and to deny them equality. That is bigotry. When the Mormons religion was against interracial marriage, that didn't magically make it a non-bigoted opinion on their part. Religion doesn't change something from being bigotry to bias. Their distate for interracial marriage wasn't just a difference of opinion because it was religious."
c89wie9,,">I don't believe any of them actively hate gays, They are just intolerant of them. >Bigots are people who have a hatred or intolerance for a certain group of peopleHow is that cognitive dissonance not hurting you right now?"

c89w6a4,Flobblem,"I am specifically saying that they are not necessarily *bigots*, but that they hold bigoted *views*. It's the same thing and someone who isn't racist saying something that is racist. I'm gonna call them out on that. I'm calling out the Tory party on their bigoted view of marriage.

But they should, if they're going to care about people being gay. Because they're given equal weight. If you say being gay is a sin, well so is eating meat on a friday.

Oh that's right, a king had an attack of conscious and just had to convert both him self and his state to a new doctrine he had spent his life savaging which also just so happened to offer him a way to divorce a wife he didn't like and undermine the power of Pope with in his state. In short, no, this is not an excuse, even if they where just blindly willing to follow doctrine that's still no excuse because they are enforcing an unfair homophobic ideal on a public that is *overwhelmingly* not of that faith. But it's not blind faith for the most part it's an excuse and one that they can no longer hide behind because people are no longer buying the bullshit in the same way they used to.There are a number of faiths pushing for this bill so they have the right to marry their members in the way that they see fit.

There's never been any discrimination against them, there's no articles anywhere claiming they would 'destroy it as a union' or anything like that, everyone needs to stop throwing political correctness at everything. It has a particular meaning that applies to particular things, it is not everywhere absolutely all of the time. If an MP wanted to bring in straight civil partnerships I very much doubt there would be any objections from anyone. They wouldn't be hounded out of town by PC mobs, chill out."
c8a9s7n,blueskin,">non religious people can get married outside of a church after allGay people could get a civil partnership in a church before, but that wasn't good enough, it seemed (and indeed, if they want marriage rather than a civil partnership, they should get it, but that should go the other way too).Marriage has too much religious and historical baggage, which civil partnerships are completely free of, and yet they are denied to straight people."
c8ab4l4,roomyn,"I think you are missing the point that civil partnerships have always been a poor relation of marriage (as they were intended to be). Some couples with a civil partnership do not have the same pension rights as if they were in a marriage (such as [this guy](https://twitter.com/Mark_Collyer), who keeps going on about it - though as it stands, the bill will extend this discrimination to same-sex marriages). It can be harder to get civil partnerships recognised in other countries than same-sex marriages, as the provisions for civil partnerships (or whatever they are called) vary so much from one country to another, whereas marriage is pretty much universal.The fact there will be at least one institution that treats same- and opposite-sex couples the same is important to many people: it will mean that you no longer have to out yourself on forms that ask for your marital status, and will mean that trans people no longer have to get divorced before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.Same-sex couples also have the problem that they are seen as inferior to opposite-sex couples by much of society, and the term ""civil partnership"" really does contribute to this. Straight people do not have to deal with this issue.So while I agree that civil partnerships should either be scrapped or extended to opposite-sex couples, it isn't anything like as important."
c8aanjx,MagmaSuperstar,"A civil partnership is defined solely as a civil union, regardless of whether it's held in a church or not it cannot be a religious one whereas a straight couple can have either a civil or religious marriage.I know civil partnerships aren't available to straight people, maybe there are people who want them to be but there's been no massive push for it so my point was it's not being ""discriminated against"" on account of not ""being politically correct enough"" it's simply not seen as a priority and if it did become one there's no reason it would have any form of backlash. My point was crying political correctness and discrimination about it is stupid, not everything is political correctness gone mad."

This just seems to add some kind of religious nonsense to it?I also think that hetero's and even siblings (like those old Maiden Aunts) should be entitled to the same protections as a Civil Partnership. I mean, why not? Do they have government inspectors from HMRC checking to see if anal buggery is happening or not, just in case a ""Civil Partnership"" or ""Marriage"" is in fact a sham?Oh sheeeeiiit! - I have now just realised why homo-marriage is a major thing - fucking illegal immigration with sham gay marriages. That is surely what is going to come. I mean Civil Partnerships I would imagine required home grown homo citizens to partner with?Fuck! I was all for it, but now see it as just another fucking loophole scam."
c8aawjn,roomyn,"> It all seems much ado about nothing to me - I mean ""Civil Partnerships"" are already the de-facto gay marriage thing. This just seems to add some kind of religious nonsense to it?Most marriage ceremonies in the UK are not religious. This bill does allow religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, but also also allows civil ones. There are a number of legal differences between civil partnerships and marriages (though immigration is not one of them, so your paranoia about illegal immigration is misplaced), which generally put civil partners in a worse position than married couples. But the main difference is symbolic, and is important for two reasons:* calling them ""civil partnerships"" instead of ""marriages"" reinforces the idea that same-sex relationships are inferior to opposite-sex ones. I have heard people in civil partnerships talk about times when they introduced their partner to someone as their ""husband"" or ""wife"", only to be lectured that they aren't ""really"" married and shouldn't pretend that they are.* children are raised with the idea that they will be married one day, and that this will be an extremely important and joyous occasion. I was a teenager when civil partnership was introduced, and I remember watching the news reports and realising for the first time (hopefully wrongly) that there was no chance I would ever get married. It made me feel really fucking horrible about myself.Also, there is the problem that any legal restrictions based on gender cause huge problems for transgender, intersex and genderqueer people, who fail to fit into the traditional binary view of gender. Lots of trans people have been forced to get divorced because of the current laws."
c8a1oyq,EpicFishFingers,"Was this a serious comment? I can't even tell.In case it was, why do you think gay marriage will increase illegal immigration? Just because there's more people that you can fake marry now?Trust me, if you're coming from a country that makes the UK look desirable, it's likely that you're already more against gay marriage than we are, so I doubt they'd be happy with going along with a charade of being gay, and would rather put in the extra legwork to seek out a British woman to fake marry instead"

Believe me, the ones that claim asylum are not the poor bastards that suffer that shit in Africa. But the ones with the cash and contacts now have yet another loophole to get into the country.As for the indigineous gays and lesbians. What does this whole ""marriage"" thing give over a ""civil partnership""? Personally I think get rid of all religious based marriages endorsed by the state, and everyone gets a stab at making a Civil Partnership. I don't care if the people involved fuck or bugger each other. They are merely sharing a life together in harmony and trust in each other so much that they wish to share all finances, and take advantage of all insurances, etc with each other. Why should the fact they are a traditional man and wife, or a pair of homo's matter. Why not some good buddies in a batchelor pad? ... and the old spinster Maiden Aunts I aluded to before? I think it is extremely cruel in the old girls case that the surviving sister of the pair is taken to the cleaners on the death of her sistor for Capital Gains Tax, etc, while a couple of homos can just fuck each other up the arse and get tax advantages that she can't.The answer is any pair of people should be allowed to have a Civil Partnership which is allowed in law as a simple contract. Fucking and Buggering is not needed. The state should not get involved in bizzarre religious ceremonies and shit - leave that to the partners to choose as they wish, but they are meaningless in the courts as far as I am concerned."

If marriage is a religious institution then one religion must not be allowed to forbid another religion to marry whoever they like. Your religion does not trump someone elses.This is the basis of the law which was just passed (well, the second reading anyway).Edit: To expand on this, it's perfectly acceptable for the word ""marriage"" to mean different things to different people. For legal reasons it can mean both opposite and same sex, each individual religion can have their own preferred definition.Edit2: Also, there are other issues with civil partnerships, for example:1) If one partner is trangendered and changes sex yet the couple want to stay together they must get a divorce then form a civil partnership, which is frankly really shitty.2) If a couple in a civil partnership move to a country with equal marriage their civil partnership may not be recognised. Portugal is an example there this occurs.3) Less importanly, civil partnerships is a shitty name because the word 'partner' has so many other uses, e.g. business partners, and is too easy to misinterpret."

In this country you have the option to have a Religious marriage or a totally secular marriage.

c89yim2,viviennewestworld,You make at least three mistaken assumptions.a. That any church will be 'forced' to marry same sex couples.They won't.Some churches won't marry divorced people. Do you think that people that have been divorced then marry again are not entitled to be legally married and have the same status as any other married couple? Is granting divorced people the right to marry again dictating to any religion?b. That all churches oppose same sex marriage. They don't. In fact the Religious Society of Friends aka Quakers have been at the forefront in advocating for same-sex marriage.c. That only marriages carried out in a religious setting are 'valid'. In fact more marriages are civil ceremonies ([68% in 2010] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_258307.pdf) )

c8a0o8w,,"Hey guys, instead of downvoting, lets honestly answer - this is a question that's been asked by a lot of people, even non-religious folk, that has to be made absolutely clear instead of tutting loudly.Okay, to answer your question.**Imagine a country where you, a heterosexual man (or woman), cannot marry your loved one because the state religion deems it**That's it.You might think there's more to it, but that is it.Let me put this into context, a mere 50 years ago, I (as an ethnic minority) could not legally marry a white woman. A black man could not marry a white woman, regardless of their love for each other, regardless of religion etc. They faced persecution for merely being in a relationship. Now, the claim is that religion is under fire if this marriage law passes. 50 years ago it was ""moral decency"", and the same claims were made on religious principles as well. Hopefully 50 years on, we can actually sensibly answer it with ""yes, god that was a quite bad time for human rights wasn't it?""Now there's lots of hooh-hahing about whether or not this infringes on religious grounds or that it redefines the historical definition of marriage, and as someone who respects freedom of religion, the answer is yes. Yes, the bible does clearly state that marriage is this thing, its not between people of the same gender, but then you have to accept that the bible makes a lot of statements that we ""accept"" as clearly being wrong, e.g. most christians do eat pork. Most christians don't keep women as chattel slaves. Most christians don't trade their daughter for slavery. Most christians don't see human sacrifice of their children as being acceptable substitutes for the slaughter of bulls, and so on. If you don't accept these things selectively, you're gonna have to explain why you do accept the other thing selectively. As for the historical definition of marriage, it has changed so many times and is written and re-written in so many cultures that its really difficult to define if marriage is actually historically between a man and a woman.And finally, who said that everyone follows the bible? I don't. Some people here don't. Does that mean we can't marry? Does that mean they can't? It certainly means, by the bible's own rules that I cannot marry someone who's a Christian."

Priests are typically viewed as being completely responsible for their individual churches so if they withheld permission to use it then there's nothing in the bill to say it could be forced. On the other hand I guess it would be possible to allow another figure, churches allow other faiths or community groups to use their buildings for instance.There's nothing in the bill to force it either way as far as I can see."

c8a372w,,I believe that must be what I was mis-remembering.
c8a6mk5,supn9,"I thought UK was way past this. Long ago. Guess not. But seriously, no offense or whatever. Is Ricky Gervais gay?"

c8a35db,MagmaSuperstar,"We will! Also pretty sure the 'faggots' were here before this bill passed, they'll just be married now."
c8a4fbu,philthehumanist,"Who still uses the term ""faggots"" in 2013? Most of my far right / bnp / UKip mates have used the word ""bumjockey"" since 2004."
c8a9ser,PsyChuan,I still use it! It's a term of affection 'tween me and my mates.

c8a3kud,thehighground,"Congratulations or is this now a burden to gay men who loved being unattached to fuck anyone they wanted..........they could always say ""I would love to marry you but its illegal.........."""
c8a5dno,givecake,"Progress is simply a name we give to the driving force seemingly created by the masses, yet truly directed by a few via popular media.If people are happy that this has taken place, then we could say that is a good thing. If people are sad, then it can also be a bad thing. I'm sad about this. I suppose if I meet some very cool and respectable gay couples, my mind might be changed, but all I see and feel pity for are those couples that seem twisted and bound in their confusion. The UK did not become great because of Sir Francis Drake, it became great because of a single storm. The Spanish would have put a stop to English Christian reform and it's growing protestantism, not to mention the huge increase in literacy from widespread reading of The Book. Was the storm a coincidence? If (protestant) Christianity has been on the decline.. then many make a fair guess by supposing UK's 'greatness' is on the wane."
c8a92k4,simon99ctg,"confused, much? you define progress to meet the needs of your argument. also, it's not about any particular ""cool"" gay couple but about the principle of not discriminating legally against people on the basis of their sexual preference. as to what the hell you're trying to say with regard to drake and the storm, i really have to no idea....good night and good luck!"
c8acc64,givecake,"I didn't define it! That was my opening point.. I was pointing at people saying these laws are progress, but it's *their own definition* of the word, and that this view has come from a clever direction via popular media. Proof? Check popular views of the masses regarding homosexuality 100 years ago! It would be naive to think something uselessly sentimental here, as if people were somehow maturing into this higher level of thinking all by themselves.Sexual preference? I'm going to assume that you believe there is some kind of neutrality to sexual preference. That it's 'OK' to choose whichever sexuality you like. Am I wrong? But there are things wrong. Even if you were to blame discrimination, the [mental health](http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead.html) statistics [are not kind](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/).And what about physical health? Well the two are entwined as much as they are, but there's [plenty of health](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/1970/32/7032205) [problems too](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/1931/dec/3112404). It's ok, Simon. I understand your thinking, and most people's. Because I have 'felt' the same way too. It's romantic to think that the heart can sway whichever way it shall and it's natural to follow it, or perhaps that people are just 'born that way'. While that may not be completely wrong, it's far from right as well. You see, our brains change. Not only do they change as the rest of our body changes, they change when we even think things. I'm talking physical changes that can be noticed during brain scans. Supposing that someone were to find evidence that gay people's brains were different to normal people's brains? That would make sense, even london taxi drivers brain's are different to the majority of the people's brains in UK. Look it all up, cast aside ignorance and free yourself from media mentality. I first learnt about Drake during GCSE History. I suppose you could have been asleep or just failed the class. Regardless, it's an interesting story! People may believe what they like though, I don't expect everyone to come to the conclusion I have. And besides, it doesn't sound like you're interested.I'm sorry I didn't spam you with more science, should the need arise, I shall retrieve it for you!Edit: Unless you have a problem with the science, and would like to submit some evidence and hypotheses for peer review to the appropriate body, I'm not sure there's any other question now as relevant as this: If being gay is something that can be changed (as has happened before) then what should we do as potential supporters? Should we encourage people in these paths of greater danger and disease or do as we would regarding any other danger? Encourage warning and caution and highlight the healthier options."
