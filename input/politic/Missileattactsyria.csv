dx8d448,PapaLGH,"Since 2013 anytime Assad had a foothold on liberation there just happen to be a chemical attack with white helmets responding. It has happened 3 times. The earliest being 2013, then I believe in 2016/2017 w chlorine gas. The US struck back the last two times even to this day having no proof it was him. He had Trump withdraw troops from his region. Meaning he was winning. It was then just Assad and Russia going back and forth. And well would you look at that it happened again. Another chemical attack on his own people. Not defending his character but history is a circle. What does he have to gain? The UN is circle jerking about it saying they have to punish him, then they end the session by saying they have no proof it was him. Destabilization, military involvement, lives lost, rinse repeat. The only motive to do that would be that he would want to go to war with the world. And considering he's had statement after statement being grateful for trump withdrawing troops to focus on his own liberation he has absolutely no political or military motive to gas children. Edit: when Syrian armies advance and liberate cities from NATO/GCC backed insurgents, said insurgents claim a chemical attack via Assad. Let the barrel bombs come on down. Kids are just pawns in a bigger game controlled by central banking, military position, and certain globalist entities wanting destabilization. One more refugee crisis comin right up. Edit 2: why did military contractors donate to Hillary? Wanted a no fly zone in Syria. What would come from a no fly zone in Syria? [this](https://youtu.be/fmE9Jj-rEVs) Guess it was just a matter of time by the powers that be. Reaching back from data on trump as far back at 1982-they 100% have something over his head and you should be very scared and alert to that. Oh and should I mention that:**GAS WAS BOUGHT FROM IRAN, BUILT BY GERMANY. Iran up to that shit once again but no one can say shit. **"
dx8lm47,PM__ME__STUFFZ,">Since 2013 anytime Assad had a foothold on liberation there just happen to be a chemical attack with white helmets responding.While Assad is in the strongest position he has held in years - it is incorrect to assume that he is a step away of having complete control over the country - he still needs to deal with Idlib and then handling the Kurds to the north. The chemical attacks must be interpreted in this light. The idea that there have only been three chemical attacks is a very US centric idea, there have been three attacks that the US has really be responsive two (2013, 2017 and now 2018) but there have been dozens of chemical attacks, in fact there were dozens of attacks in 2013 alone. One of the reasons Assad continues to use chemical attacks is because most of the time it goes unnoticed (the use of chemical attacks is confirmed or reported until months later so there is no big international retaliation.)A second reason that Assad continues to us gas, even when it may seem against his strategic interests, is that its pretty damn effective tactically. After the gas attack the remaining rebels in Ghouta who had refused to surrender surrendered, and now the rebels in Idlib and the Kurds are eyeing these gas attacks wondering if they will be next. And Assad doesn't really give a shit if US troops are in the region for the moment - he knows that under Trump the US troops will withdraw once the rest of the country is secured (and that under Putin the Russian troops will remain.)"
dx8s2bg,PapaLGH,"Gassing children with Iran bought canisters would make every country in the UN go to war with him. Using it for strictly military instead of just control, like you stated, seems like the absolute most counter productive thing possible. He's had statement after statement praising trump for the withdrawal. When all the news networks are all saying “bomb syria” it's not a good sign. But tbh it doesn't matter wtf we think. If the other govs are on board they'll do whatever they want. 3 chemical attacks I was talking about had thousands of casualties. He's an ass but if you listen to any of his interviews he shows his side and how fucking blatantly stupid and obvious this is a false flag to set up destabilization most likely via Iran and then US Russia go to war w Syria. Which is something I do not want to see happen again."
dx8snub,PM__ME__STUFFZ,"> Gassing children with Iran bought canisters would make every country in the UN go to war with him. Using it for strictly military instead of just control, like you stated, seems like the absolute most counter productive thing possible. But it hasn't - that's the point. No one is going to war with Syria over the gassings. There has been what, one or two major air strikes as a result - given the tactical success of the gassings its clearly a price Assad is willing to pay.Russia is already basically occupying Syria - and they are never going to go to war with Assad. And the US isn't putting boots on the ground any time soon."
dx8vkof,PapaLGH,Not whataboutism but Clinton ran on a no fly zone in Syria that would've made us go to war with Syria and Russia. But yeah.
dx8w6et,PM__ME__STUFFZ,No fly zones do not automatically lead to war (see the no fly zone of Iraq Kurdistan we maintained for years - which ended up entirely unrelated to our invasion of Iraq.)
dx92ch6,PapaLGH,"Not all no fly zones are the same. In the middle of a refugee crisis, in the middle of a civil war, with Iran funding one side, and Russia pushing the other. Then we come in saying no one can fly. Yeah. What's your reasoning for wanting this then? You think it'll make the area more stable? Another “regime change”? Another “we came we saw he died”? Another ending of the gold Dinar and bringing back slavery? Another refugee crisis? More human trafficking?"
dx6occb,haysanatar,"Before military actions in complicated areas like Syria its standard to tell other countries you don't intend to hit its coming. I don't think anyone wants a direct military conflict with a nuclear power. Hitting a Syrian base that houses chemical weapons is one thing, hitting it while a bunch of Russians are there can escalate things into direct conflict. There is actually a hotline between the two countries to avoid just that kind of problem.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/24/us/politics/russia-united-states-syria-hotline.html"
dx6sjbp,PM__ME__STUFFZ,1) I'm not saying its a bad policy - just highlighting that Trump criticized Obama for doing the same.2) There is a big difference between specifically informing nations also involved in the conflict zone to prevent collateral issues and tweeting.
dx70426,haysanatar,I 100% agree on both counts.
dx6fe9o,Whatnowhatno,Bolton. Day two.
dx6g52h,rootofunity,Whats scary is Bolton can and probably is capitalizing on the fact that Trump's under pressure from the investigation and looking for something to make him feel good
dx6gl4c,StuStutterKing,"The more the Russia investigation is pushed, the more Trump will lash out at Russia's allies. With Bolton there, we are fucked.Mattis must be going crazy there."

dx6lwe6,WengFu,"Well, smartish."
dx6sdlb,CheetoMussolini,"More cunning. A smart person wouldn't have disbanded the Iraqi government and military after capturing them intact, plunging the nation into anarchy. An even clever person wouldn't have then disenfranchised all former Baath party members - most of whom joined as the only way to have a prayer at economic security - immediately creating a destitute, aggrieved, militarily experienced class of people (including most former army officers and leadership)... People who immediately rebelled and started a civil war.Invading at all was dumb, but FFS we could've actually succeeded at rebuilding the nation even after that mistake were it not for the blinding stupidity of that administration."
dx6w2j4,WengFu,We had about as much of a chance of rebuilding their nation into a functioning democracy that you do of helping your neighbors with their martial problems when they haven't asked you to do so. We can't even make our own democracy function correctly.

dx6keqg,EtherGavin,Is that.. is that better?

dx6kxvx,The_Island_of_Manhat,"|...being played by a moron who can't talk properly feels much dirtier. There's no good translation, but the Israelis have a term for this: *freyer*.

dx6tmah,PaulFirmBreasts,People who voted Trump but now don't care about politics are the scariest of all. You just know they are silently waiting for any reason to support/vote for GOP candidates.
dx6v1cx,Sparky400Hz,"They still come in spinning the daily talking points.Just today a supervisor asked if I knew about how the zucc was testifying about removing republican stuff. After about 45 minutes of explaining that Ted Cruz is an idiot, that's not what this was about, and no... they didn't confirm anything, he admitted that he only watched the clip of the Cruz exchange. Luckily, it's easier to shut down now that it's the spin of the day tlrather than unwinding a decade worth of conspiracies. Now if I could just get him to stop seeing politics as us vs them, I'd be golden."
dx6p9fr,Duke_Tokem,That's an amazing sub. Thanks for mentioning it!
dx6znuz,RegalWombat,"It was the same shit with the “fuck the Dixie Chicks, nuke em and let god sort em out” Republican voting people who proudly voted for Bush in 04 despite things being a clusterfuck.

dx725co,GlamrockShake,"My dad was gloating on FB the day after the win and I talked to him on the phone and explained that I was never going to let him off the hook for this - that, unless he showed significant remorse over his decision to vote that way, everything that happened because of Trump's victory was something for which I was going to hold him personally accountable. Just the other day I told him that, when he is a decade older and history has advanced to see Trump for who he is, that the prevailing reputation will be tied to him also and I will forever remember him as somebody who rabidly supported the traitor.You can't let people off the hook for this. They'll keep going back to their vomit, like dogs."

dx6puli,mdot,"I've never been in the military, so I don't particularly understand the phenomenon, maybe you can shed a little light on it...Do Marines become a little loony because of the intake process, or do you have to be a little loony to join the Marines in the first place?I mean no disrespect to the Marines, I'm sure even they would admit to some eccentricities themselves, just curious."
dx6q7lk,lordderplythethird,"> Do Marines become a little loony because of the intake process, or do you have to be a little loony to join the Marines in the first place?A little of A, a little of B, sometimes both... But really, it's just that the Marines operate almost as a cult honestly. Once you're a member you're always a member (""there's no such thing as a former Marine""), etc... but they kind of have to be due to how they operate and need to rely on the guy in the air just as much as the one in the hole next to them. However, it tends to make the leadership worship aspect far greater than any other branch, which is why Mattis and Kelly are revered as damn near saints by Marines, while Petraeus (before the leak of classified info) was just some guy to most in the Army (even though he was the military best tactician since Patton and literally wrote the book on counter insurgency)."
dx6q9pf,mdot,"Very insightful, thanks for the response!"
dx6s5tg,Widdleton5,"we're insane. If you meet a Marine that hasn't at anytime thought to themselves ""I wonder what plunging a bayonet into a dude's throat really feels like"" they're probably full of shit. A few things about Marines: they're the youngest branch of service so anything spoken about conflict involves incredibly dark humor that makes most people uncomfortable. It is this culture of the Marines that makes them so lethal. If a single Marine ever locked and loaded without the mindset they are the baddest motherfucker ever to walk the earth then their NCOs have failed them in their preparation for that task. The reality of military troops throughout history is the majority of them are 17-25 year old men. Doesn't matter if it's Iraq/Iran conflict, Egypt/Jordan/Lebanon vs Israel, or WW1 and WW2. The basic troop on each side is a man that hasn't yet become a father and still hasn't even touched their 30s and has the emotional immaturity that's prevalent in a barely legal adult. The Marines have focused on their training so that when our young citizens finish just four months worth of training they are ready to fight a tank with a fork if it's required. From the outside in it appears the brain washing is working but I assure you the results from Marine training with take an 18 year old from the most pampered, safe, and comfortable existence in human history and create the conditions that when they face an enemy from the toughest upbringing in the world today they will not just win they will annihilate them. Equipment alone can not give you that result. It takes the will to endanger yourself and the self control to do it effectively. The reason the majority of combatants are still alive in Iraq and Afghanistan is because everyone hates us. They're all eventually combatants. If we're paying someone to not kill us I don't think they're envisioning putting up a Walmart next to a Victoria's Secret in their local Bazaar anytime soon. There are many problems in the middle east and if we were just murdering every military aged male and calling it a day I don't think that'll even solve them. However in countless engagement Marines have distinguished themselves as battle ready and the good ones are able to train their subordinates so that when shit hits the fan again they can react with focus and clarity on what the mission needs. One last note I'll make about the Marines (and I guess all the services). We are losing too many combat veterans from the ranks due to the downturn and now the bullshit. Once the floodgates stopped cutting so many of the top guys (with years worth of deployments) the Headquarters of the Marine Corps basically left most of the hollow structure in tact and then just promoted people to fill the vacant ranks. This has lead to an incredible amount of enlisted troops hitting ranks like Corporal or even a fucking Sergeant in less than 3 years of service. The majority will do their jobs to the best of their ability but it wasn't even 6 years ago that entire swaths of the Sergeants throughout the service were being let go for not making the next rank with 9-12 years of total service and now that we're building forces up again the HQMC has filled those 11 year (4 combat deployments) Sergeants with 3 year (1.5 of it in bootcamp/MCT/Tech school) troops. I think for the first time since 2001 the majority of the Marine Corps has not had a combat deployment. Add in the fact all of our shit is broken and our aircraft are deathtraps and sure, let's invade Syria while we're at it. That'll show em."
dx6u51d,mdot,"This is extremely illuminating, thank you for taking the time to write that.Just wanted to highlight a couple of things...>The Marines have focused on their training so that when our young citizens finish just four months worth of training they are ready to fight a tank with a fork if it's required.This statement is, at the same time, both hilarious and extremely comforting.>If a single Marine ever locked and loaded without the mindset they are the baddest motherfucker ever to walk the earth then their NCOs have failed them in their preparation for that task.As someone that played football up through college, and now coaches my son's team, I completely understand this mindset/philosophy. Although with nowhere near the same risks as military service, this is the *exact* same mentality that drives successful football teams.If the coach hasn't convinced the team that they can manhandle *anyone* that dares step in front of them, then that coach has failed.Also, you have to have at least one screw a little loose to play football at any level past Pop Warner. hahaThere are a few things that I have never once questioned about the Marines I actually know, that they are ready, willing, and able to really fuck an enemy up, and their commitment to do a really good job fucking enemies up."
dx6wuqv,buyfreemoneynow,"Holy shit, this is the most humble description of the USMC that I have ever heard from a marine. When I was in the 82nd, both the best and the worst (mostly the best) new guys I got were former USMC; I'm sure you can understand how that cult mentality can program some young guys to be incompatible with another branch that they talked shit about (and really believed it instead of thinking of it as sibling rivalry++) but also know that there are a lot of bright and capable guys who know how to adapt to life in the corps and then move on with their lives."

He's truthfully not the kind of guy to just go blow things up just because he can.Here's an interesting article about his reading habits: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/11/23/the-avid-reading-habits-of-trumps-potential-secretary-of-defense-james-mad-dog-mattis/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.be5a0f4c1919"

dx6tzdl,MauriceReeves,"I wanted to respect Tillerson, especially because my son is involved in Scouts, and Scouting is a big part of Tillerson's life and ethos and history. That being said, I felt like he often betrayed the values and principles of Scouting at every turn, and it was personally offensive to me that he did that. I know that not all Scouts embody or live that way, but it was such a big part of Tillerson's story, but it was extra upsetting. Even when he was CEO of Exxon, he flouted morals and principles that he promoted to youth and I find it all (and him) very distasteful."

He'd be an awful POTUS, and his policies would lead to enormous suffering for the poorest Americans, but with Trump and co. you get all of that suffering anyway, PLUS the growing threat of hostilities, PLUS profound stupidity, PLUS treason, PLUS environmental armageddon (Ryan might at least be amenable to seeing the new business opportunities offered by work on and with renewables), PLUS endless Twitter rants, plus much, much, much, much more."

While Clinton or Romney would definitely have been tougher on Russia in many respects, they wouldn't have done what happened this morning by nakedly taunting a nuclear and energy great power and G8 member. Trump's ties to Russia make him that much more willing to take desperate actions, especially with a neocon at his side. Double especially if he thinks he can survive whatever Russia has on him due to the unfailing loyalty of the American right after he all but confessed to obstruction of justice (spoiler: he probably can)."

Whether he's doing this with Putin's blessing or if he's actually acting against Russia is yet unknown, but the end result is the same: more dead civilians, more food for the military industrial complex."
dx6jkmt,lovely_sombrero,"But now Russia will release all the ""kompromat"" that they have on him, right?"
dx6js08,StuStutterKing,"While I don't believe Trump colluded with the Russian government (there is ample evidence he laundered money for Russian oligarchs and criminals), that's not how Kompromat would be utilized. Putin doesn't actually care about the state of Syria. If anything, US intervention strengthens Russia's power over Syria's regime. If the collusion allegations are true, any Kompromat would only be released if Trumps acts directly against Russia, or refuses to enact Putin's demands."
dx6jz58,lovely_sombrero,">If anything, US intervention strengthens Russia's power over Syria's regime.Eeeem. How? >or refuses to enact Putin's demands.Like ""get out of Syria""?"

On late Monday evening Mattis was seen throwing his prized copy of “Meditations” by Marcus Aurelius — which he refers to in times of personal crisis — right out the window in a fit of rage that reverberated around every ring of the Pentagon.>“This fucking guy gave class info on ISIS to the fucking Russians?” Mattis reportedly said, according to witnesses. “Hey I've got a great idea, let's tell them where our subs are too, because we all just want to be friends and sharing is caring or some happy horseshit.”>The 66-year-old former Marine general was upset over a story in The Washington Post which found Trump had disclosed highly classified material to Russia's foreign minister in a meeting at The White House last week. The story, which was immediately condemned as fake news by Trump and people who don't read above a fourth-grade level, was confirmed by The New York Times, Reuters, the Associated Press, and Russian news agency the GRU.>According to sources, Trump's latest disclosure prompted Mattis to begin shoving his entire desk outside his Pentagon window in what officials described as something of a reenactment of a scene from the film “A Beautiful Mind.” The secretary one-upped the character of John Nash however, throwing one of his aides onto the desk four stories below the window before firing into his lifeless body with his personal .44 Magnum.>At press time, a recently-captured western intelligence asset inside the Islamic State was expressing thanks that Trump's national security advisor H.R.

When Kelly came in to replace Priebus, people were saying that maybe Kelly would be able to control Trump and make Trump more ""presidential.""Nope. Not happening. Trump will **NEVER** be presidential. He will always act like a 5 year old, he will always embarrass himself, and our country, on Twitter. He is what he is. And that's why he *must* be impeached."

dx6rfzt,venomae,"Mother would be pleased, for once at least."
dx6nqdz,ElodinBlackcloak,I wonder how Amendment 25 Sect. 4 would even work when Pence is a Priest King waiting to happen and won't do anything against Trump on top of the fact that the Cabinet is in shambles.

dx6s0pw,TrumpHasCTE,>other body **as Congress may by law provide**So Congress would have to pass a law delegating that authority to some other group. That's not ever going to happen with the cowardly and complicit GOP in charge.

dx6yfur,US_Election,"Um, flip forward a bit. Get to the part about how the President gets to contradict them in writing and reassume his powers unless the Cabinet says it again, and then Congress decides with 2/3 majority what happens. And then stop and think whether Trump won't be likely to fire his entire cabinet in that interim. Not gonna happen."
dx710xw,BeeLuv,"Well, poop."
dx6u0fy,FleekAdjacent,Trump wouldn't pass the personality test required for many retail jobs. So we gave him unilateral launch authority over thousands of nuclear weapons.
dx743as,safewordisbonespurs,"WWIII- that will stop Mueller's investigation, won't it?"
dx74j6h,FleekAdjacent,"WW3 won't start over this. Putin and Trump are going through the theater of a lot of creating a lot of tension that can later be ""eased"" with the upcoming summit.Trump thinks he's in control of the situation, but Putin is much smarter than him and capable of thinking two steps ahead. Trump is likely going to get played, but he'll never even consider the possibility - even if it happens."
dx75kxz,safewordisbonespurs,"I don't disagree with your assessment, but the odds of someone miscalculating are increasing, and then we have a president known for doing monumentally stupid things, and letting others suffer the consequences.If it comes down to Trump finally being forced to accept the consequences of his failures, I'm pretty sure he would round up his coterie of sycophants, toast their successes, then blow the place up. There's no way he's going to cooperate with the FBI, or any other authority, for that matter."
dx76jza,FleekAdjacent,"I absolutely agree that the odds of a miscalculation are high. Or even Putin simply turning on Trump because it would be immensely destabilizing and leave him confused and unable to process what had just happened. I think this could go a lot further than people in the White House expect and get nastier than they imagine, but WW3 is firmly out of the picture.

I think they've been teasing the whole nuclear annihilation + genetic mutation + climate change combo so that they can throw out some really crazy creatures during the next season and develop it all a lot more quickly than after the last extinction event. They could go with birds being dominant, which would be a cool throwback to the late cretaceous when the series was probably its best. Or they could stick with mammals, have different continents develop different super-predators, and then in a few million years, get all the continents back together for another pangaea.

Michael Cohen is Trump's longstanding lawyer, and his [office was raided on Monday.](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/fbi-raids-office-of-trumps-longtime-lawyer-michael-cohen.html) Cohen's [connection to lawfirm Squire Patton Boggs is somewhat of a mystery, but has been long established](https://www.politico.com/tipsheets/politico-influence/2017/09/15/former-trump-lawyer-still-working-with-squire-patton-boggs-222315).

He didn't appear to work on client matters with firm attorneys in New York, and whatever benefit he provided to the firm wasn't apparent to his office colleagues.Some inside the firm also had concerns about the alliance, even before Cohen's legal troubles devolved to the point of FBI agents raiding his office.Sources who spoke to New York Law Journal on Tuesday said Cohen, a longtime aide to President Donald Trump and his private attorney, kept to himself and didn't frequently interact with New York personnel at Squire..."" Squire Patton Boggs [has been confirmed to also be working as lawyers for Cambridge Analytica](https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/18/regulators-in-the-uk-are-also-calling-for-more-hearings-into-facebook-and-cambridge-analytica/), which ties this into the news cycle about Facebook, which [confirmed that Cambridge Analytica also had access to some private messages](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-private-messages.html). This also connects to [Brexit and UK politics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/07/the-great-british-brexit-robbery-hijacked-democracy), as it has now been etablished that the firm also influenced the Leave campaign. Squire Patton Boggs has also been in the news for [helping a Russian bank avoid U.S. sanctions.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/two-former-senators-are-helping-a-russian-bank-fight-us-sanctions/379494/)Also of note is that Meuller appears to have everything he needed on Cohen, and [passed off authority to perform the raid of Cohen's office in relation to the Stormy Daniels case to a New York Law firm](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/fbi-raids-office-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-n864121) and [Rod Rosenstein personally approved the raid](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/rosenstein-personally-approved-fbi-raid-against-trump-lawyer-michael-cohen-nyt.html), so Trump is feeling the walls closing in, not only from Meuller, but also from his own circle.

Whether this is just a coincidence is anyone's guess, but all signs are pointing to a major ongoing conspiracy, so I'm skeptical about this being a ""wag the dog"" operation, but it almost appears that way. The timing is too convenient, and all of the rest of these pieces of information seems to fit into a cohesive narrative thus far. However, chemical attacks on civilians is a war crime.

dx6xl6n,Spidersarebad69,I think its more likely the russians actually had nothing to do with it. It makes zero sense to use something that instantly points the finger back to you in putins position and putin doesnt have a whole lot to gain from more sanctions or possibly a hot war with the West.

His options were basically 1.) Missile Strike, 2.) Hit Syrian air Force, 3.) Stay in Syria. Option 1 does nothing. Option 2 would actually be meaningful. Option 3 would make Putin unhappy. Same with option 2. So... He took option one. This has almost nothing to do with Bolton. Even Obama would have made a military response to chemical attacks. Only he would be taking out their air Force and giving Putin the middle finger. Trump chooses to make a weak gesture that makes it seem like he is doing something."

dx6k2r3,fredagsfisk,"Well, it's apparently working... already seen several Trump supporters claim that the bombing of that airfield (that was up again within hours) and the (*totally* not) Russian mercs dying when attacking the US base (that I don't think Trump ever condemned or even commented on?) is 100% proof that Trump is not colluding or friendly with Russia. On a slightly cynical note, say that Trump *does* bomb Syria and *does* hit some Russian(s)... Putin asks him to get sanctions dropped as an ""apology""... well, I don't think that scenario too likely, but the fact that I do not feel like dismissing the possibility instantly is a bit worrying."

To him, obstruction is not obstruction because he stands to gain from it. Anything that he cannot directly manipulate for his own benefit is ""unfair"". He uses the word a lot. Pay attention to the context.On some level, he actually believes all of this shit he's saying. It speaks volumes about what a sad, decrepit person he is.

dx6fy15,Billmarius,"You reminded me of a passage from my favorite lecture series:>""Until the time of Julius Caesar, Rome's conquests were essentially private enterprises. Romancitizens who went to war came back with booty, slaves, and a flow of tribute exacted by local agentson commission whose techniques included extortion and loansharking. Cicero claims that Brutus lentmoney to a Cypriot town at an interest rate of 48 per cent — evidently a common practice, and anearly precedent for Third World debt.14>Whether they were well-born patricians or overnight millionaires, Rome's soldiers of fortunewanted to enjoy and display their winnings at home. The result was a land boom everywhere withinrange of the capitol. Peasants were dispossessed and driven onto unsuitable land, with environmentalconsequences like those that Solon had recognized in Athens. Family farms could not compete againstbig estates using slave labour; they went bankrupt or were forced to sell out, and their young menjoined the legions. The ancient commons of the Roman peasantry were alienated with even lesslegality. As in Sumer, public land passed quickly into private hands, a situation the Gracchus brotherstried to remedy with land reform in the late second century B.C. But the reform failed, the commonswere lost, and the state had to placate the lower orders by handing out free wheat, a solution thatbecame expensive as the urban proletariat increased. By the time of Claudius, 200,000 Romanfamilies were on the dole.15>One of the revealing ironies of Rome's history is that the city-state's native democracy withered asits empire grew. Real power passed from the senate into the willing hands of field commanders, suchas Julius Caesar, who controlled whole armies and provinces. It must be said that in return for power,Caesar gave Rome intelligent reforms — a precedent often invoked by despots impatient with the law.“Necessity,” wrote Milton, is always “the tyrant's plea.”16>Ancient civilizations were generally of two types — city-state systems or centralized empires —both of which arose independently in the Old and New worlds.17 With the eclipse of its republic by itsempire, Rome changed from the first kind of polity into the second. (A similar evolution hashappened in other times and places, but is not by any means inevitable. Several modern countries,including Canada and the United States, show characteristics of both types.)>Some years after Julius Caesar 's murder and a further round of civil wars, the senate made a dealwith Caesar 's great-nephew Octavian, who took the name Augustus and the new office of princeps.These measures were supposed to be a special case, for his lifetime only. In theory, he was the chiefmagistrate and the writ of the republic still ran. In reality, a new age of quasi-monarchy had begun.18The empire had outgrown the institutions of its founding city.""Ronald Wright: [2004 CBC Massey Lectures:](http://www.cbc.ca/radio/ideas/the-2004-cbc-massey-lectures-a-short-history-of-progress-1.2946872) **A Short History of Progress**"

dx6i7mw,DeFex,"how can you not be cynical with trump, when has he done the good thing?"
dx6jp3q,CapnSpazz,"It could be. One of the many aggravating things about Trump is that it's sometimes hard to tell what he's doing. I wouldn't be surprised if it's what others have said and he's planning this with Put in, and he may or may not bomb an empty field or something. Then he looks good for being tough on Russia. On the other hand, it is Trump, and if Putin did say something mean to him like he implied, he likes to go after that person without thinking things through. He's been called out for this so many times. Like recently with Amazon. The only difference is that this time the way he could be going about it might get people killed, and not even the right people.Essentially I guess we're just gonna have to see how this plays out."

dx6g60p,lucasbelaq,I thought so too because it would be cover to appear as enemies. But this sets precedent. One of the two have to look like the weaker one who just talks. Is that Russia or the US? and then it's hard to imagine they put themselves in this situation just for show. It looks like things are escalating. I mean just the amount of troops we are amassing on their border? Imagine Russian troops along our border? We only need a match at this point.

dx6npgb,_NamasteMF_,"Russia greed to do something about Assad, Trump agrees to lift sanctions. Putin has Assad step down for his picked replacement, and retire with most his countries wealth. Win/ win for Putin, and probably why he did the gas attack. Putin is sick of Syria and wants to concentrate on the Baltic states and the Arctic. Trump gets to claim he solved the Syrian civil war (it will still be ongoing). Russian sanctions are lifted and we no longer object to Putin's claims to the Arctic in the UN. Canada gets ducked over again."
dx6jbwi,SpiritFingersKitty,"TBH though, if we were to attack Syrian bases, we sure as hell wouldn't want any Russians to get caught in the crossfire. We don't necessarily need to kill Syrian troops (missiles would be a shitty way to do this) but to remove strategic capabilities."

dx6mzwr,rd1970,"Putin has never been a fanatic - his interest has always been money and power.

dx6i6qd,ohemiggo,the country that has been helping its ally nation reconsolidate its territory... wants its ally to be unstable?
dx6ie2i,ToadProphet,"Sure, and it's a decent theory. Though it's only that, a theory. If one of the pipeline gets built - either from Qatar or Iran, Russia's stranglehold on European gas supply evaporates.If you consider Russia's relationship with Assad and their ability to stop him doing shit like the chemical attacks, at the very least it makes one wonder why Russia hasn't forced Assad to behave."

dx6ghr7,haneef81,"Saying Germany had no money is misleading, isn't it? They had less than no money I thought. They owed significant money to other nations to repay for war damages.

Modern Russia analogies to Weimar Germany aren't very useful except at a very high level. The economic and geopolitical landscape seem so different."

dx6gc1r,ToadProphet,"There are two proposed pipelines in the ME - one is a Qatar/Saudi/Turkey pipeline backed by the US and US companies. The other is an Iran/Iraq/Syria pipeline backed by Russia (although I suspect they'd be just as happy if it wasn't built). The former goes right to Europe through Turkey, the latter goes to the Mediterranean via Syria.Both need to go through Syria, and Assad supports the Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. Obviously the US doesn't want Iran's oil flowing freely to Europe.Puts a lot of the current events in the ME into perspective."
dx6h5mh,FarkCookies,> Obviously the US doesn't want Iran's oil flowing freely to Europe.Why tho?
dx6hg9a,ToadProphet,Would strengthen Iran significantly and their relationship with Europe.
dx6hja6,TheFlickeringLantern,"And yet, it would give a competitor to Russia. The odds the Iranians are going to just go along with a Russian gas cartel aren't exactly high. And if nothing else it creates, more gas supply overall."
dx6hp4n,ToadProphet,"Yup, and that's why I believe that quietly Russia would rather keep Syria destabilized and prevent any pipeline from being built. Russian companies have huge interests in the proposed pipeline but it is still likely a net loss for them."
dx6swc7,OminousNamazu,"> And if nothing else it creates, more gas supply overall.I don't think the US or Russia particularly cares about this. The whole region is just one giant proxy war.

dx6l8aq,Death_to_Fascism,"That is bullshit, the fact there was Russian interference doesn't magically turn Clinton into an angel."
dx6nzk7,astroshark,Russia wouldn't have picked a fight with the US over a no fly zone in Syria. The hysteria over that was in fact pretty much manufactured by Russia.

dx6lzxl,CordageMonger,How convenient that every shortcoming she had can be excused ex post facto as Russian propaganda.
dx6qsrp,Arshearer,Or Hillary Clinton was just a war hawk. Trump being a disaster doesn't make her not lousy.
dx6h5f6,gizzardgullet,"Hillary Clinton was only a ""war hawk"" in that her geostrategic decisions would have been extremely *calculated* and thus careful not to spark a hot war between US and a nuclear power. Yes, maybe HRC would have spent more time dedicated to moving pieces on the geopolitical chessboard but that would have reduced the threat of a nuclear war, not increased it because it would had addressed tensions in a timely fashion and kept instigators in check and reduced their ability to move into threatening positions.The threat of a nuclear war comes from not putting too much thought into geopolitics, letting things slide and then just trusting your gut and shooting from the hip in a last minute outburst (Trump style)."
dx6qmy6,fuckyoubarry,Like she calculated invading Iraq?
dx6qjf0,,None of what you just said makes any sense. Just because your geostrategic decisions are extremely calculated doesn't make them good decisions or ones that will lead to more peace and less war. Hillary's history as SoS make that very clear. You only have to look as far as Yemen and Syria.
dx6t711,OminousNamazu,"> Just because your geostrategic decisions are extremely calculated doesn't make them good decisions or ones that will lead to more peace and less war.Not only that, but it implies the other side isn't paying attention and noticing the incremental moves you're making.

dx6gj89,I_CARGO_200_RUSSIA,"Plus, “being friends with russia” working out just great, isn't it?"
dx6nxj0,_NamasteMF_,It will- Putin will have Assad step down for his chosen replacement in exchange for the lifting of sanctions and getting access to the Arctic. Trump will claim victory in negotiating the end of the Syrian civil war (which will still be ongoing).
dx6jt48,BeeLuv,"They'll be our friends again when we lift sanctions. “ Look, folks, believe me, we have to lift these sanctions now to keep Russia from hurting us. Pooty needs to be placated” “Grr. Roar. Growl.”“See, look, very mad!” <Putin and Trump exchange surreptitious thumbs-up>"

dx6j47n,darkwingduck9,"Are you serious here? Think about Hillary as secretary of state going into Libya. What about Honduras? What about her Iraq war vote? Most importantly, what about Hillary wanting a no fly zone in Syria? That would have pitted us against Russia.I'm on mobile so I'm not searching for sources right now. Hillary made a public appearance last year and said something to the effect of us needing to actively be involved in Syria. Hillary said we need to respond to Russia's cyber attacks militarily."
dx6jvmw,Helmite,The argument being made is likely that they pushed the idea that Hillary would get us into conflict as a negative that wouldn't happen under Trump. Now it seems like that has gone up in smoke because Trump decided he needed to posture again just like he did last year.
dx6kdde,darkwingduck9,"Whatever the intent of their post was, the takeaway should be that both Trump and Hillary were war candidates. Nobody should have supported either of them."
dx6kifz,TheAcidKing,You're not wrong. I'm one of the liberals that called Hillary a hawk (I still would if she were running) but at least I have confidence that she would be pragmatic. Trump has no strategy or goal to speak of. There were 2 bad candidates in the last general election but we elected the worse one by far.
dx6lemt,darkwingduck9,I'm not so confident that Hillary would have been pragmatic. The Democrats need to be antiwar. I don't count myself among their numbers anymore so people in this subreddit probably just want me to shut up (not saying this includes you). Meanwhile the people who want me to shut up will vote for the former CIA agents running for Congress as Democrats and then wonder why we are at war.
dx6phoj,TheAcidKing,I think she would at least be pragmatic in pursuing a neoliberal agenda. Whether that's good or bad (and I'd say bad) is a different debate. I'm with you on the direction that the Democratic party *should* take.
dx6wv8x,Boughner,"They told me if I voted for Hillary we'd wind up in a war. They were right, I voted for Hillary and now we're gonna wind up in a war."

dx6lw82,CordageMonger,You can't just gloss over the reality that she was seriously pushing a no fly zone and had a milquetoast as fuck response to what would happen if a Russian jet violated it. It's possible for both her and Trump to be bad at foreign policy.

Obama argued that our actions in Libya didn't violate War Powers because there were no ground troops. He asked for congressional approval with Syria (which was never voted on). Part of the difference was that our allies (France) requested our assistance in Libya, where as we were acting on our own initiative in Syria- but overall, the War Powers Act has been largely ignored by a weak congress that doesn't want to take a real position.

All those gas pipelines Russia has invested in would be very easy targets too.That's one of the problems with Asia, there's not a lot of buffer, so it's easy for Nations to have troops stationed around each other in rapid Striking Distance. In any case im not too worried about it. Putin and Trump and won't really let Syria end their love affair. They might launch a few missiles, but those are more like little love bites."

dx6ittb,pooponagoose,Gotta warn daddy before attacking.
dx6iw34,IronyElSupremo,Great way for Russia to test its anti-missile defenses as the Syrian military takes cover or disperses. The only thing left to tell them is direction and time .... as not to disturb tea service.
dx6jul5,BadModNoAds,"Considering the reliability of missile defense systems as well as the reliability of Russian technology I think the chances of them intercepting a missile is actually extremely low. I'm not even sure they have the accuracy to hit the missile launchers either, at least not with precision. Russia's military has a lot of old tanks and subs. I'm not sure about their ballistic accuracy, but I have my doubts since they have always been way behind in that area. I wouldn't bet on the US or Russian anti-missile technology to work in real world scenarios that well."

dx6k7hq,postusa,"This is, of course, what Putin's objective in Syria ha always been. Barely last week, Trump was declaring that the US would soon be leaving. Putin has gained a lot from the festering open wound that he has perpetuated in Syria. Masses of refugees fracturing European politics, destabilizing Turkey's NATO allegiance, and a US mired in a conflict we bear plenty of responsibility for. And the more the US can be coaxed into participating, committing troops to the ground, the harder it is to leave, and the more the world will hold us accountable for creating it. Assad's 'gas attack' in response to Trump threatening to leave was as predictable as Trump's cruise missile tweets."

Stop the arms race?This is the most important tweet imo, it makes too much sense that Russia and Trump would fake an arms race only to come to a peaceful agreement where they stop the beef in exchange for the US to remove Obama's sanctions on Russia, that might be the sole reason Russia (allegedly) helped Trump get elected.The only down part is that this tweet makes the conspiracy a little TOO obvious."

dx6lk9f,thefunivehad,">As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump complained the Obama administration talked too much about when and where it would attack the Islamic State in Iraq, ruining the element of surprise.Sure, [this article] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/04/10/trump-syria-threats-dont-ruin-element-surprise/502978002/) goes into detail about how ""warning"" of an attack isn't necessarily giving up the element of surprise...but when DJT criticized Obama for doing, that wasn't what he meant. He explicitly said Obama WAS giving up the element of surprise.The point being, it's just another of the millions of things DJT says out of both sides of his mouth that, when connected to Obama or HRC, it is bad...but when he says it, it's good.So which is it, Trump supporter? Giving up the element of surprise or not? Should your man have announced to Russia that ""we're coming for them?"" Or should he have kept it close to the vest and not said anything? Surely you don't believe it can be both."

And she also favored the same kind of tax plan Trump did. She was a pro wall street, pro big bank, pro corporate democrats and the biggest tax cuts were still going to be for the wealthy donors that she owes, and she did owe many of them including Goldman Sachs. She was also anti single payer healthcare, anti free public college (as the rich would have to pay their fair share for this to ever be possible and she was never going to make them), and not even just with Russia, she was a total warhawk about the middle east. She was a republican that ran as a democrat for her entire career. That is one of many reasons why she lost. But I'm sure you'll just have some bullshit to throw at me about how you ""feel"" because to the far left, its feelings over facts. The far right is beliefs over facts.. Huh.

Assad has killed hundreds of civilians in a gas attack. We should be intervening every single time Assad is purposely targeting innocent civilians and I wish we responded more often. These are innocent people with hopes, dreams, children and parents who were slaughtered by Assad. They have no power to fight back against a state backed by Russia. Without the US and the West, these innocent people will keep dying. I hate Trump as much as the next guy, but the one good thing he's done so far has shown some sort of mindset that he'll punish Assad. Albeit inconsistently, and only for certain attacks, but I think that's an improvement for the sake of the many who have been killed in this needless war."

I'm saying that without the West, and specifically us, leading an effort to prevent these attacks, Assad will continue to savagely attack innocent civilians to get to his ultimate goal. I agree the US has done some horrible things, and I think we should answer for them. But why does that mean we should now say “We'll we've killed civilians, so fuck those in Syria currently being bombed, they're on their own, because we don't have the ‘moral high ground.'”"

dx6pw9y,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"I'm not sure we're even arguing the same thing here. I'm saying we should help the civilians who are being slaughtered. We don't have the moral high ground isn't a good excuse for why we shouldn't help innocent people. Neither is “we won't stop the war with a few missiles.”It's a start, and it will hopefully help innocent people with full lives just like you from being slaughtered. I've never understood the viewpoint of the arguments you're giving, why should we not help innocent people because we've done some bad ourselves? Why should we not help innocent people because it won't end the war? Those are all separate issues from the issue of whether or not we should retaliate for a literal war crime and the use of a WMD on innocent civilians. I think we should, and I don't think trying to distract from the main argument is a good argument, in fact it's a logic error: you're not arguing the main point, you're trying to distract from the main point and muddy the waters with unrelated issues to the issue of whether or not we respond directly to a WMD attack on civilians."

dx6jis6,UglyPineapple,This is Trump letting Putin know so he can get his troops out of the way.
dx6johj,jll027,Then Putin called and reminded him about the pee pee tape and he changed his tune towards Russia
dx6joxq,DOCTORE2,"This doesn't make sense . The war in syria is nearly over and assad won , logically he has no reason to use gas attacks . Yet he did , and he knew 100% that the US would escalate if he did , so why did he risk his government and his chair only to gas people when the war is nearly done . Assad may be a criminal , but he's not stupid by any means . Either the ""moderate rebels"" whom are armed and trained by the US , or someone who wants this escalation and wants assad out did this ."

dx6lnro,OleKosyn,"Privatization will happen anyway, but I'd rather see it happen on a more competitive market than in form of direct gov't-corporate collusion that creates monopolies and oligopolies where there shouldn't be any.

""Just another company"" is easier to force transparency upon than a ""Titan of industry"" and ""Pride of America""."
dx6kl1e,Archisoft,"I thought he said he wasn't going to telegraph his moves?I mean, from a military stand point you've telegraphed it wont be bombers or troops.

dx6l68d,psychoticdream,why the hell is he telling russia? when supposedly assad is the ruler in syria? is it because he knows syria and specifically assad is russia's bitch?
dx6lep1,swallowsummer,"Trump has turned into the 'PANT SUIT AFFICIANADO' or whatever she describes herself on her Twitter page.

dx6r2st,Sleepy_Wayne_Tracker,"Not sure how it works technically, but if Trump calls out Russia and its troops in Syria, then launches said missiles at Russians, or dares them to stop them, is he not directly or indirectly saying we're at war with Russia? Isn't the whole point of proxy wars to avoid going head to head with another super power? Won't Congress have to be involved at some point, since it is not a defensive strike?"
dx6sr42,Whitey_Bulger,Only if Congress cared to be involved. They've basically given up taking responsibility for foreign conflicts.
dx6rhzs,noisewar,Russia counterattacks by hacking all YouTube videos to show pee tape. Instantly neuters America.
dx6rnzg,ThatFanficGuy,"So, there's this comic book, *The Manhattan Projects*. Crazy/brilliant and intense storytelling. The fact that it tells the story of Clarke's Third Law-level science and aliens hiding behind the pretence of building an atomic bomb is almost irrelevant.The Projects' leadership managed to milk the US government for cash (a blank check, in fact) on the premises of the Cold War going on. However, said leadership has also struck a deal with the USSR top science, prompting a new age of knowledge advancement. The Cold War is acknowledged by both parties ""in the know"" to be a charade to the goal of obtaining the resources necessary to maintain research capacities, now that the possibilities are almost limitless."
dx6szxy,RDGIV,"Probably a good idea, we don't want to hit any Russian positions, just Syrian ones. Do people not understand why that's important?"
dx6t0mx,Roadtrak,"Good. Assad cannot go unpunished for his use of chemical weapons. The west ought to be striking his stockpiles and air force every time he uses chemical weapons, no questions asked. This is a redline, just like Obama said. I do not like Trump, but airing his intentions via twitter in this instance imo aren't much of a problem. Russia needs to be informed of or intent, (this will happen formally off twitter ofc) america will most likely as before give them advanced warning of our targets so as to avoid russian casualties. I do not want a large scale war. At this point i am starting to see Assad as a necessary evil to stabalize Syria again in the short term. This should not lead to large scale war. Precision bombing against Assad every time he uses chemical weapons. He will soon get the hint."

dx6kx3j,psychoticdream,bolton has always been a dick. despite iran slowly going from religious conservative to slowly becoming more open to the world and bolton STILL wants to bomb the shit out of them. being tough on another country does not always mean going to war directly or immediately with them. surely you are smart enough to realize that?besides why is he telling russia if assad is supposedly the ruling person causing these attacks is in syria?
dx6lhi2,marxism_kills,">despite iran slowly going from religious conservative to slowly becoming more open to the world and bolton STILL wants to bomb the shit out of them.100% bullshit. Their funding of Hamas and terrorism around the world is well documented, so let's ignore all that stuff which is a perfect reason to start moving against them militarily -- let's talk about what you brought up: their people and their government.Not only are they still ruled by Religious Clerics, not only was ""they're becoming moderate"" a lie pushed by the Obama Administration to pass the Iran Deal; but Iranian people are overwhelmingly nationalist and religious fundamentalists to the point where they largely *support* the ruling party because of their of their desire to make Iran a stronger regional power. Maybe they're becoming ""more open to the world"" in regards to economic prospects -- which is why they protested the government several months back -- but otherwise they support the State's efforts to increase Iran's influence, build nuclear weapons to combat Israel's influence, and to expand Iran's borders.-You LITERALLY cited Obama Admin talking points, and that chucklefuck is the LAST person you should be citing as a good source on the state of Iran because Obama's policies are why we're in this mess to begin with. It was OBAMA that appeased Russia. It was OBAMA that appeased Iran. It was OBAMA that withdrew our troops from Iraq. It was OBAMA who was too afraid to retaliate against Assad after he said chemical weapons use against civilians would be a ""red line"" for him.Please save me the bullshit Obama apologism.>being tough on another country does not always mean going to war directly or immediately with them.We're not going to war, take a deep breath and settle down. When Russia is actively sabotaging our drones in the air and actively provoking us through their military action, what the hell do you think we're going to do? The Left are so weak-willed on Foreign Policy that when it comes time to act, you're scared into inaction -- just like the Obama Administration.Every time Russia has sought to provoke us under Trump, they inevitably back off. They'll make stern threats, and then back off. The same thing is going to happen here: Russia will posture, we'll blow up a few of Assad's bases, probably levy more sanctions, and then /r/politics will continue pretending that Trump is a Russian shill."
dx6n4hp,psychoticdream,Here the issue is assad. Why would trump warn Russia that they are about to attack or bomb Syria?
dx6o2la,marxism_kills,"Because Russia is the main reason why the Assad regime has held, and why they continue to be propped-up as legitimate. Russia has interests in the middle east with two nations they're incredibly close to: Syria and Iran. The void left by the Obama Administration has enabled Russia to step in and provide the Assad Regime with weapons support, and they have even used chemical weapons *themselves* in the form of white phosphorous on civilians where a rebel base was stationed. Allying with Syria gives Russia access to the Mediterranean sea. Allying with Iran gives them access to the Arabian sea."

What do you think is the best course of action for a nation that meddled in our election, is disrupting military operations, and are firing shots at us?And no, you cannot use ""sanctions"" as a cop-out because the Trump admin has levied 3 separate sanctions on Putin and he is becoming increasingly hostile.

dx6x25r,Iskandermissile,"If you use conventional weapons repeatedly over an area which results in equal or greater casualties I fail to see the difference. 131 civilians killed in one strike. A blast radius doesn't discriminate. I remember the US used a MOAB over a ""reported terrorist"" compound in Afghanistan. That weapon is not meant to be precise either. It is just language used to justify mass casualties on one side. Both are terrible. No one dead says they wish they were killed conventionally instead of gassed. The result is the same."

dx6vlcf,Arabismo,"Let's see, these are the options so far.1) Direct military strikes against Russia, lol even this sub isn't that insane, tho I've seen a few comments here and there suggest such a thing2) Additional Sanctions: There are already major sanctions imposed on Russia, just the threat of additional sanctions alone is increasing the likelihood of option 1 and 3 becoming a reality.3) A major military campaign against Putin's allies such as Assad, we are now here. And I have witnessed plenty of advocacy for this option on the sub, ""attack Russian interests in Syria to show them we mean business"", well Trump may do just that. 4) Pray Mueller will save the day and arrest all the big bad traitors, this is probably the most popular view on the sub as of this moment, but wow is it naive. I've said this before, this investigation will burn down into nothing more than a PlameGate 2.0. 5) Actually, begin to seriously address the fallout of the neoliberal nightmare, the conservative stranglehold on public discourse, or the inequality, injustices, social and economic issues that allowed the Russian meddling to gain a foothold, to begin with. But, apparently, this option is off the table. And of course there's my position which basically boils down to the fact that Russian meddling is vastly overstated and a gigantic distraction and scapegoat for the tactical and ideological failures of the Democratic party, as well as being a massive display of hypocrisy on the part of the United States, who constantly rig elections the world over, and in fact literally bragged about rigging Russia's election just a couple decades ago."

dx7wjhw,rrtangent,"No shit. You were satirizing a position practically nobody here embodied. Just because most people on this sub wanted a harder stance on Russia (""harder"" here meaning literally anything more severe than nothing) doesn't mean they want the freak in office ""teasing"" military action like this (and taking it back almost immediately).
