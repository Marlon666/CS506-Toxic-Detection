dven6me,headtailgrep,"""President Donald Trump has accepted an offer of a summit from the North Korean leader and will meet with Kim Jong-un by May, a top South Korean official said Thursday, in a remarkable turnaround in relations between two historic adversaries.Speaking Thursday night outside the White House, Chung Eui-Yong, South Korean national security director, said that Kim had requested the meeting."""

dvfavxk,BrotherBodhi,"Obama assassinated people around the globe (US Citizens included) without due process. We are talking about places where the US was not at war, where the United States government has no business even being. These are people who were killed based on an affiliation and based on the idea that someday they *might* commit a crime against the United States. No due process, no trial, no need for evidence, and no need for a crime. This is deeply troubling on so many levels. And this is my biggest problem with Obama. Not just that he did this - but also that he passed this assassination program onto Trump. God knows what he is doing with it"

dvfksjh,DrowningInPussycats,There were not too many men there for sex addiction - he was one of maybe 2 or 3. Most were women. I was there for drugs (they did drugs/alcohol/eating disorders/sex addiction). I was not in his therapy groups as we had different issues (not that I'd share anyways) and he was most tight lipped. Told a couple good stories involving strippers.Him coming was such a spectacle - we had helicopters flying above the place trying to get photographs of him.

dvf9hix,,WWI is sorta hard to understand in middle school honestly without something simple like an assassination being the climax of tension. My history class senior year covered the hundreds of little things that pushed people to WWI but it was an AP styled class that was optional and we literally spent a quarter on each war (it was a 1 semester class) still skipping a lot. WWI is just a lot harder to grasp because WWII had such a clear seeming narrative to the west in stopping Hitler and for the US they also have the bombing of Pearl Harbor to spur their action.

Yeah you will fuck them up but you're now in a position where an attack is the end of normal life in america. So it's a stalemate. Hence dialogue. I'm guessing the press in America is still preaching dominance. It's far more dangerous than that.

dvez4na,daOyster,"I am aware of them. I'm also aware of the principle of MAD. Believe me, even though various nations might seem crazy with the way they act, they all understand that you still need your country left standing after everything is said and done if you want your attacks to be worth it at all. That's basic military strategy. You don't become a significant sized nation without understanding that. Nations don't go to war so they can say they won, they go to war to gain power over someone else whether through resource or land control. If you want to have power over someone else, you need to ensure you're still left standing to enforce it. A war that results in no one left standing is therefore pointless and even the most aggressive nations understand that. Keep dreaming about your end of days fantasies, but I assure you that as long as national leaders have a desire for power, there will be no war that results in the use of WMDs."
dvf1sus,dead10ck,"I think that's a pretty generous take on humanity. Personally, I don't think most people are very good at thinking consequences through, or thinking logically about war, especially during times of crisis, and doubly especially for narcissistic egomaniacal personalities like Putin and Trump."
dvf4oo3,daOyster,"It's not a generous take on humanity. It's a take that is based on the basic human instinct of survival and on basic military strategy. You're right that most people aren't good at thinking logically about war during times of crisis, but this is something even easier to rationalize for personalities like Putin and Trump. Don't forget, a narcissistic, egomaniacal power crazed individual still needs people to manipulate to keep their power, even if they don't care for them. That's something they know and aren't going to jeopardize it by starting a nuclear war that will wipe both you and your enemy off the face of the planet. Though it may seem they act without regard to logic or anything, they're actually aren't. It's just another set of logic that only makes sense when you have that much power and responsibility, something me and you really aren't likely to ever personally experience in our lives.If I'm actually wrong about all of this and it does happen, I'll eat my sweaty socks.

dvfcl6q,Flyingwheelbarrow,"An economy on a war footing with a nuclear arsenal fighting in what would be an war for survival comes down to resources, labour, allies and strategies.Remember Germany nearly took Europe twice and they were out gunned, out spent and had less allies.We could only guess the results of a European land war.Also the only way the United States could end a war in two weeks with a country the geographical size of Russia would be with the use of Nuclear and chemical weapons would literally depending on the way the wind blows would devastate its trading partners and tank its own economy post war."

dvetdpo,Fiddle_Stix69,tbh honest I'm kinda impressed. The USA seems to be full of wackos with guns and still no-one has shot your president.Edit: Well no this one anyway
dvev0t5,THExLASTxDON,>The USA seems to be full of wackos with gunsSomebody watches too much CNN.
dvewq3s,Fiddle_Stix69,I don't have CNN I'm from Aus. I said seems cause that's the impression you guys give off.
dvf96iw,THExLASTxDON,"My bad, that was kind of a dickhead way to respond to your comment. I should've just explained how gun violence is vastly overstated and over-reported, primarily because it fits a lot of people's, including the mainstream media's, preferred narrative (and most importantly it makes them money, if it bleeds it leads or whatever the saying is).The CDC found that 61% of firearm related deaths are suicides and out of the approximate 30,000 some people that die per year from guns, they estimated that up to 2.5 million people save their own lives by using a firearm. We do have a shit ton of guns, and our culture definitely has issues, but it's nowhere near what a lot of people try to make it seem. In my country you are more likely to be beat to death with a blunt object like a baseball bat, than be shot by an assault rifle."
dvfaq76,Lugia3210,Now compare it to Europe or Australia.
dvfdg5y,THExLASTxDON,"Compare what? Violent crime? I doubt you want to do that. That wouldn't fit the anti gun narrative.Or are you talking about incidents with the specific inanimate object that is basically banned in those countries? Because yeah, that's kinda obvious. It'd be like a country banning vehicles and then saying ""Look at us, we have less drunk drivers!"".Also, why look at other countries with completely different cultures? Why not look at the fact, that in America there isn't a single peer reviewed study that proves more guns = more crime?"
dvfhlh8,laserkid4u,"You are getting your violence here shortly.Give it a generation or two of the new arrivals failing to integrate and end up in generational poverty with no way to advance and succeed save for ""outside"" the nice rules of civilization."
dvgysjh,Fiddle_Stix69,Despite us having a difference of opinion I really appreciate your calm and reasoned response. There's not enough like you on the internet
dvgz4uu,Fiddle_Stix69,Last I checked australians have like 0.14 guns per person while the USA has 1.01 per person. I understand America might not be actually filled with gun toting crazies but you guys do have states where citizens rock around with a sidearm openly carried and to me that's insane. Understand the average iq is one hundred...so potentially half of people are under that number and they could be holding a lethal weapon on their belt or in their handbag and can be prone to emotional instability. I'm sorry if I'm being mean. I'm not from America nor have I been. The presentation of you guys in pretty much every film I've ever seen has half of not more citizens wielding. There's an Australian film called welcome to woop woop (which is good btw) where all the Americans are carrying as a joke. Anyway my point is my belief of your country being full of gun toting crazies is heavily reinforced by the media so sorry bout that
dvh2ute,THExLASTxDON,">Last I checked australians have like 0.14 guns per person while the USA has 1.01 per person.For sure, but then there is countries like Switzerland which also have very loose gun laws and a high rate of gun ownership, yet their gun violence is extremely low. I feel like that is a good example that can be used to prove that the inanimate object isn't the problem.Also, we can even ignore other countries (because it's kind of hard to compare with the differences in culture, the way crimes are reported, etc.). There isn't a single peer reviewed study that shows more guns = more crime. I've been linked blog posts, 8th grade book reports, etc. that'll say stuff like ""If you have a gun in your home you are more likely to be shot by one."", which is the equivalent of saying ""If you drive a vehicle, you are more likely to be in a car accident."" or ""If you live in a two story house, you are more likely to fall down stairs."". I feel like if guns really were the problem and they make you more likely to be a victim of crime, then that would be easy to prove.>but you guys do have states where citizens rock around with a sidearm openly carried and to me that's insane.I definitely understand how that could scare people, but I promise you, those aren't the people you have to worry about shooting you. You don't even have to trust me on that either, just look up the stats. Law abiding concealed or opern carrying citizens are not the ones shooting people out here. In fact, you should actually feel safer when you see that IMO. That means the area that you are in isn't a gun free zone (which is somewhere near 98% of where mass shootings occur, because these sickos/cowards look for the path of least resistance).>Understand the average iq is one hundred...so potentially half of people are under that number and they could be holding a lethal weapon on their belt or in their handbag and can be prone to emotional instability.Fair point. I guess I just don't look at people with a lower IQ as more likely to be evil. It's just anecdotal evidence, but some of the most emotionally unstable and evil people I know, are borderline geniuses. You might be right tho. I never looked into the effect that below average IQ has on gun violence.I do know that there is definitely a correlation between high population + low income areas, and crime tho. Speaking of, I saw a study the other day that showed 68% of gun related deaths in this country, comes from only 5% of our counties. It is sorta frustrating to me that people think the answer to that problem, is to not focus massive efforts towards fixing those areas, and instead just blame the inanimate object. That solves nothing IMO and doesn't get to the root of the problem.>I'm sorry if I'm being mean.Nah, you're good. These conversations usually get way more heated than this. By now I'm usual told that I supposedly don't care if kids die, and that the person I am debating with hopes that I am shot in the next mass shooting.>The presentation of you guys in pretty much every film I've ever seen has half of not more citizens wielding.There is definitely a different culture in my country. It actually severely damages and warps people's opinions on guns IMO. Because of it, some people think that suppressors actually make the sound that they do in the movies, and that all assault rifles are fully automatic. And then these people will advocate for stripping certain freedoms, based off of fallacies. I definitely don't think the answer to that is to ban or blame that type of entertainment, just think we have to combat and counter it with education.>Anyway my point is my belief of your country being full of gun toting crazies is heavily reinforced by the media so sorry bout thatAll good and that's totally understandable. I just want people to do as much research as possible, while being as careful as possible when reading the statistics (because both sides of this argument will frame stats in a way that reinforces their opinion, but may not tell the whole story)."

dvf8zfw,TheMer0vingian,"Hah, I actually immediately thought of this as well. If they met in NK there would be nothing the US could do to prevent the slaughter of Trump and his entire entourage of security if Kim ordered such (I doubt he would, as this would mark the swift end to Kim's power and the entire NK regime). However, reading another article on BBC apparently it is still unlikely Trump would meet in NK due to such security risks, and similarly Kim rarely leaves NK due to security risks and also being barred from travel to many countries. Apparently the two most likely options are a meeting taking place in the Korean DMZ or a meeting hosted by China as a neutral third party."

The only thing that's changed is the addition of Trump's big mouth that's given the optics of relations being precipitous. Also Kim Jung Un only wants money and aid in exchange for empty promises. This is what NK has done for decades and that won't change. You forget Trump's character and temperament. He's an idiot and does not negotiate-- he bullies. At best nothing will change with NK. At worst we're going to war because of Trump incompetence and negligence. Tell me one good thing Trunp has done for the American people.

dvesis5,Ol_Dirt_Dog,I was about to make a post about how nothing is going to change because Kim is going to demand WAY more than Trump could possibly give. But then I remembered that Trump campaigned on closing foreign military bases. Maybe they could actually make a deal.
dvf8ygx,freetambo,"He also campaigned on how the Iran deal was a waste of money. But he also doesn't seem to give a shit about campaign promises; anything's possible, really."
dvfegod,josefshaw,What campaign promises has he reneged on?
dvfhojw,bel_esprit_,Releasing his taxes
dvfibfi,Bears_Bearing_Arms,"Very few, if any. While he hasn't succeed in fulfilling all the promises he tried to keep, I don't think being stonewalled by the courts or Congress should really be a mark against him. Like him or hate him, he does seem to be trying, at least. Off the top of my head, he's gotten funding approved for the wall and begun implementing or is planning to implement it, ICE has picked up its activity, going after funding of states with sanctuary cities, congress tried a few times to repeal Obamacare, he's implemented protectionist policies, tax cuts, given the military more latitude, trying to regenerate NAFTA, selected an SC judge off the list he initially provided, pulled out of TPP, pulled out of the Paris agreement, implemented the travel ban, made executive workers have to wait X number of years after leaving to lobby, and is axing executive regulations, amongst other things. All of this he campaigned on."
dvfjyps,I_KILLED_CHRIST,"> he's gotten funding approved for the wallI had to stop after just this one because holy fuck. ""We are going to build a wall, **and Mexico is going to pay for it!**""Let's see... more broken promises... Going to label China a currency manipulator. Ah, nope. Repeal *and replace* Obamacare. Has technically done neither. ICE only going after violent criminals? Nope, they're swarming everyone.What he has come through on has hurt America or only helped the rich. What did you get out of the tax cuts? The world laughed at us for removing ourselves from the Paris agreement... and ya know, climate change is real. Trump was directly influenced by the NRA lobbyists just a week ago and changed his tune on gun control. The TPP just went through yesterday without the US getting free trade.I was at a Trump rally. The man lied to my face about the crowd size. Said the outside crowd was double the size of the indoor. Go look outside and there is no crowd. The man is a fucking con and only a true moron would trust anything he says. Don't be a moron."
dvfk3js,Bears_Bearing_Arms,"> The world laughed at us for removing ourselves from the Paris agreementYeah, because they wanted our money. We are still on track to meet the goals without us having to fork over money to other countries."
dvfqvk3,bel_esprit_,"> Yeah, because they wanted our money.Wrong. First, the monetary contribution wasn't even a requirement, it was a suggestion that we assist *voluntarily,* along with other wealthy developed nations. Bc we are ~~the top contributor~~ **the top contributor of all time** to ghg emissions, *which has directly resulted in climate change,* we are *expected* to take responsibility for our actions and hold ourselves accountable, by trying to make up for it on a global level. It's common decency, at the very least.These poor, underdeveloped nations in Africa and Asia haven't contributed *anything* to climate change. But guess what? They soon will. Many of these countries are on the brink of their own industrial revolutions, just like we had back in the 1800s- you know, the official kick-off to man made global warming as we know it?! Their economies and middle classes are growing, just like ours did in the last one-and-a-half-centuries. What do you think that means? The people in those countries will soon be entering middle class status- they'll be getting cars, having electricity, riding airplanes, all kinds of things they've never done before that we do every day- they'll be living our *dream.* And there's *billions* of them. We can't stop them for wanting the same comforts that we enjoy- that would be hypocritical. And we can't stop their economies from growing and them from enjoying the benefits of that. That's anti-capitalist. There's literally nothing we can do to stop their progress. What *we can do* is help financially provide environmentally sustainable infrastructure for when these countries do make the switch to middle class societies. We can teach them to learn from our mistakes- the mistakes we made in screwing up the environment so they aren't bound to repeat them. **We have a moral obligation to help them with environmentally sustainable solutions,** so they don't revert to cheap coal and oil, launching us full speed to climate change destruction.Is it the most ideal situation? Of course we never want to just shell out money to other countries haphazardly- who does? But there would have been major benefits if we had agreed.What Trump sorely missed is that The Paris Agreement would have cemented us in an *excellent* geopolitical position in 3 ways:1. Puts us at the forefront of all the new, cutting edge technology to appease climate change. Green light Go. This means jobs, an entire new industry centered around our research, being the global leader, and ultimately increased health and prosperity for Americans. Regardless of what the coal and oil industry want you to believe, renewable energy *is* the future and the whole world is on board with that (see Paris Agreement). China is super stoked about it and they're gladly taking over what was supposed to be *our* #1 global leadership position. 2. If we are funding the sustainable infrastructure in select developing countries, then we literally have inherent control and say over how/where to implement it- putting that sweet geopolitical power right into our hands, without having to shed even a drop of blood. There's not a better way to low key gain control of desired regions if that's what we so wish. 3. Even though we didn't want to shell out the extra money, it will brand us again as the “good guys.” Our American image has been tarnished in recent history and we are no longer admired by the world as a shining beacon of light, hope, and goodwill. Assisting other countries in sustainable development for the betterment of the whole world is a *noble-as-fuck* cause, and we would have been cherished for that for a long time to come. Instead we forfeited our model of excellence to be like everyone else. Lame. > We are still on track to meet the goals without us having to fork over money to other countries. Yea, *we* may be on track now bc of our light pivot toward a more renewable model (though I doubt it bc Trump and the GOP slash environmental initiatives every day in favor of their oil and land development cronies' greed), OTHER DEVELOPING COUNTRIES who are approaching their industrial revolutions **are not on track.** Which is the whole point that's been made above and by anyone with a conscious who sees through Trump's charade."

I meant to say that the United States is the top contributor OF ALL TIME. China is hardly first in emissions historically and they are actively taking leadership steps to reduce it. So GOH, go back to your Russian troll farm, breathe polluted ass Trump air, go have his babies if you love him so much, clearly you don't know what you're talking about, and you literally must hate to breathe and enjoy COPD and asthma, the lack of oxygen is getting to your brain, you might wanna get that checked out.

dvf5au2,kemb0,"Yeah true that. NK may be totally taking advantage of Trump's desire to stop spending money on anything government related. They get a disarmed south in return for a promise not to build nukes. Sounds like they're totally playing Trump at his own ""negotiating"" game: do something outrageous, everyone gets irate, agree to back down if opposition agrees to do something they never planned to do in first place. Net outcome: you're back to where you were originally but your enemy has given something up which is to your advantage."

dvfjbc2,andersonle09,This is exactly what I envision happens.
dvewhbr,DogOfDoughnuts,"NK can't cause WWIII, it'd be more like the vietnam war only with clear objectives."
dvfa219,Ishouldbepolite,"It's a client state of china, who has significant border disputes with all their neighbors, including a very high temperature one with India.NK provokes the US, the US temperately reacts triggering china to react and involve themselves. The military build up and mobilization will cause India to mobilize as well. The border dispute becomes acute. Russia sees that their primary enemy the US is gaining ground and declares them on to be on china's side. Now Europe gets attacked as well.Less implausible then a Austria-Hungary conflict with Serbia as the cause of WW1"
dvfa4bz,DogOfDoughnuts,China is way too reliant on trade with the US to let that happen and US is more than willing to let China have NK in whole.
dvfaibb,Ishouldbepolite,"Wow! I'm glad you know that for sure.>China is way too reliant on trade with the US to let that happenFun fact, international trade between the future combatants before ww1 was at an all time high.And yes, quite a few people believed Russia wouldn't make a big deal of Serbia either. Meanwhile China might believe otherwise since the US has threatened nuclear exchanges, and publicly toyed with pre-emptive military strikes. Going as far as dismissing the SK diplomat who was against pre-emptive strikes.Weird definition of:> and US is more than willing to let China have NK in whole.The idea that it's impossible for a NK conflict to spiral into WW3 means you are both ignorant of the history regarding previous world wars, and ignorant of current day geo-political realities. Irrational behavior is always a large driver in history. And irrational is a great description of both Trump and the NK regime."
dvfaj61,DogOfDoughnuts,China isn't in control of NK and that's the problem.

dvfb0ly,,"Nothing changes: I think this may seem a possibility but the reality is the US is being drawn into narrative controlled by NK. Trump can only damage potential US Asia Pacific relations by conceding to anything from the NK side, it's all for appearances the likelihood for real political progress is slim. The only way this plays out 'progressively' is for NK to ask for trade agreements or lifting of sanctions to aid it's impoverished state. If the 'Great Leader' is willing to open his doors to UN inspectors to guarantee denuclearization Then I can't see any take away from this other than the raising of another 'Strongman' profile in the form of Kim. Trump will undermine anything he does retrospectively. This is just another episode in the sorry decline of US influence in the world."

In the case of Clinton, most of the images the North Koreans took with him were used in their propaganda, as in: look! the mighty American president has come to grovel before your North Korean leader!The North Korean leadership will also do subtle things, like saw or sand down the legs on the chairs of the Americans or South Koreans, so that they appear to be much smaller and more uncomfortable in the presence of Dear General."

dvf760w,farcetragedy,"> trump's no-nonsense dealings with other countries have set a precedent that he doesn't make empty threatsActually Trump has proven that he makes empty threats.

He did nothing. *Then* on September 3rd NK conducted another nuclear test . . . still no fire and fury from Trump.He clearly didn't follow through on his threat. It was empty."
dvfb34w,SDGfdcbgf8743tne,"Yeah, well, you can prove anything with facts."
dvf3mut,DGlen,"Or, NK gets a bunch of sanctions lifted right away, doesn't ""test"" missiles for a little bit and then when the US refuses to remove troops from SK he will go right back to the same shit over again. Trump is going to do about as well as his has getting Mexico to pay for the wall. He will tell you he ""made the most progress of any president ever."" You can choose to believe him if you want to though."
dvf27h3,Seven2Death,I think its more he wants to show trump to his citizens so they can see how evil america is and south Korea dif all the real negotiation work but we're all just guessing anyways.
dvf2kra,REEEEE_tbh,"The situation has been stagnant for decades, and then one factor changed: trump was willing to hold th le economic stranglehold on NK until they died, and yet you attribute that to some miraculous breakthrough in South Korean negotiation? And something about America being evil? That just doesn't make any sense.Though I will give you that we are speculating, the evidence is pretty strong to support my theory."
dvf3d0g,ozonejl,"Or, if you pay attention to actual experts, NK has been seeking a summit for decades because it gives them international legitimacy. The factor that changed is our head of state is now an idiot with no attention span, who in a matter of months has gone from talking about his button size straight to a summit without the negotiations and framework that should precede such a thing."
dvfer38,josefshaw,">without the negotiations and framework that should precede such a thingDo you work at the White House? If not, what would you know about the groundwork?"
dvf2ut6,Seven2Death,"Kims missle changed the situation imo thats really the factor. Things were stagnant cause there was no reason to do things. Now the games changed. I like to play devils advocate. NK has tons od evil america propaganda. Maybe they plan on doing a side by side showing how dignified kim is vs trump. For example. Edit :just wanna say you're at 5 for your op then im 1 then neg3 (i upvoted its valid points even if i dont agree) now me 2... This is exactly what i want reddit to be. Shame this shi5 never lasts hivemind always picks a side and thats the end of any discussion. Its discussions between 2 viewpoints that make you realize what the other is thinking. And thats exactly what the world needs. Its why fake news is so prevalent and the Russians were able to interfere with your election. We need to change how we approach internet ""arguments"". Stop picking sides and approach each comment individually. Humans are complicated we are not a 2 sided coin. You dont have to be for or against you can have mixed feelings thats fully acceptable. Im drunk so sorry for the soapbox"
dvf97n8,The3Percenterz,"You're exactly correct here. Too bad reddit is FILLED with liberal looney tunes who can't think logically, only with well intended emotional dogma intended to confuse and separate everybody that hears their nonsense."
dvf9sxx,,"Emotional dogma? Things were stagnant for decades until NK got nukes. That's why they're at the table now, they've got a bargaining chip that's not just an artillery barrage that results in nuclear death. That's the truth, hence why NK and SK met last week and Seoul is the one passing along the message that NK is willing to give up the nukes. This isn't because of Trump's actions for better or worse."
dvferyq,REEEEE_tbh,"NK has had nukes for years, things are only now shifting that trump has taken on the task full force.Based on who you cite, our strategy of targeting Chinese business rather than government has led to revenue drops in NK of over 70%, their economy is absolutely destroyed, and will not recover without us choosing to let our foot off their necks.I get that you have to discredit trump to ease the cognitive dissonance that he's actually doing well, but You're ignoring so many details in this negotiation to prop up the regime, and it appears just to be in spite of trump."
dvf9vko,The3Percenterz,"So..""The era of strategic patience is over."" Had little to no effect? Not to mention vicious sanctions. Just saying I even agree obama did a few great things and look past my bias."
dvfcelq,,"Wait, you're mocking ""liberal looney tunes"" for not being realistic and you think a quote that did nothing to stop NK from launching several missile tests held water? The ""fire and fury"" line definitely did a lot too.Korea has been cut off for decades and the only bargaining chip before was going out swinging at SK (or collapse, but that's akin to threatening suicide to keep a relationship going: it's not really suppose to be put on the table). Nukes actually give NK something they can afford to ""give up"" to get what they want and not appear weak to their people which is why they're coming to the table now. Trump didn't set this in motion unless he *gave* NK nukes. This is pretty much the chain of events that's been predicted since the question of, ""What happens if NK gets nukes"" was asked and not just answered with ""Nuclear war."" [It's a cycle that's been done a few times, albeit they never had the full ""nuke"" until now. The offered talks when they shot just a rocket before.](https://www.globalpolicy.org/security-council/index-of-countries-on-the-security-council-agenda/north-korea.html)"

They are in a position of strength in this negotiation, and they know it.

dvfg224,PoliticsAside,"Those aren't “dealings with other countries.” Those are campaign sound bites or other (fake) news stories (“sources say”) taken out of context that you saw on CNN or r/esist. How about his very productive meeting with Saudi Arabia, resulting in trade deals, rounding up rogue princes, and women's rights like driving happening for the first time right after? Being the first President invited into the Forbidden City in China and making Billions of dollars in trade deals between the two nations, including a HUGE contract for West Virginia)? You people are so blinded by brainwashing that you can't even give the guy credit when he does do something right. I'm not saying everything he does is great, but sometimes, he gets things right and deserves credit for it. The Presidents of both China and South Korea give Trump credit for progress on North Korea.

MbS was appointed Crown Prince a month after Trump's visit and gained a ton of power. Modernization reforms he had advocated for over the course of the last 5 years were then implemented. It's not Trump making this happen, it's an unrelated change in leadership.>women's rights like driving happening for the first time right after? Again, MbS has pushed for a number of women's rights issues resulting in several ""firsts"" for Saudi women over the course of the last two years. Trump has nothing to do with it.>Being the first President invited into the Forbidden City in China The Forbidden City is basically a site for tourism these days. I paid 6 bucks for a tour in 2006 and while it's lovely, Trump having tea there isn't exactly a massive step forward in international relations. If the bumbling statements I mentioned don't count as ""deals"" I don't see why this should either. It's the Chinese preying on Trump's vanity much more than a Nixon goes to China moment.>making Billions of dollars in trade deals between the two nations, including a HUGE contract for West Virginia)? AKA buying up extraction industries in West Virginia. They bought a ton of businesses which means the energy sector is partly owned by the Chinese. Isn't this very similar to the Uranium One fiasco that the Right lost their mind about recently? It's also an [MOU](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-09/west-virginia-gets-china-energy-deal-that-dwarfs-state-s-gdp) so it's not at all a done deal. It's a handshake agreement at best and may or may not fall through.>You people are so blinded by brainwashing that you can't even give the guy credit when he does do something right. I'm not saying everything he does is great, but sometimes, he gets things right and deserves credit for it. I'll give him credit when he earns it. I was impressed when he banned imports of elephants from trophy hunts but he quietly walked that back. Thus far, his major foreign policy acheivements have been angering almost every one of our allies, and installing an oil magnate with close ties to Putin as Secretary of State (Tillerson went on to eviscerate the State Department and reduce our capacity for diplomatic outreach). I'm not brainwashed. I'm paying attention and I don't like what I see."
dvfq9tw,PoliticsAside,">""Trade deals"" here is code for selling them $100 billion in weapons. We sell them arms all the time and I'm not sure that's a good thing especially given the war crimes they recently committed in Yemen.I'm not a fan of arms deals either, but it's life blood of our economy unfortunately. Obama and Hillary sold the Saudi's waaaay more arms than Trump did, but didn't hear anyone complaining then. Oh right, it's only bad if Trump does it. But yes, I agree with you that it'd be nice if we didn't arm the world.>There is no evidence that Trump had anything to do with this and it appears to be an internal anti-corruption act undertaken by Mohammad bin Salman (MbS).

Sure. >The Forbidden City is basically a site for tourism these days. I paid 6 bucks for a tour in 2006 and while it's lovely, Trump having tea there isn't exactly a massive step forward in international relations. Don't even try to conflate Trump's private tour and dining in the palace in the Forbidden city with your ""tour"". Even CNN thought it was a big deal:>Trump will be the first foreign leader to have an official dinner in the palace since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949.Sorry, but this was a big deal. You claim they did it to prey on Trump's vanity, which perhaps they did (it'd certainly be a shrewd move on their part), but that's exactly part of Trump's act. He gets respect from leaders in Asia. How about his very warmly received speech at APEC? No respect at all <rolls eyes>. >AKA buying up extraction industries in West Virginia. Isn't this very similar to the Uranium One fiasco that the Right lost their mind about recently?Lmao, not event remotely what's happening. This investment by China into WV would be more than double the state's GDP for last year. It's a HUGE influx of capital and jobs, in a state that badly needs it. Yes, it's a preliminary agreement, but name me one politician that's done more for West Virginia in the last 10 years. This was a great move by Trump. >Tillerson went on to eviscerate the State Department GOOD! Our government is waaay too bloated. It doesn't ""reduce our capacity for outreach"", it saves your freaking tax dollars. Also, I have zero problem with demanding equal respect from our ""allies"" and expecting us to treat them as they treat us. For example, the tariff on steel. China taxes our car imports 25%. Why shouldn't we tax them back? If they don't like it, they can lower their import duties on us and we'll do likewise. But we can't go around getting hosed at 25% on many of our exports and only taxing imports 3-5%. I would like to say that although we seem to disagree one a number of issues, I really appreciate the attempt at a reasonable, rational discussion here. We do agree on many, including the elephant trophy hunt ban, that is disappointing. I don't like everything Trump does, but he's not the pure, distilled evil that people on Reddit like to claim. There is a truth in the middle ground."

A good analogy is like someone who took an AP bio course and now thinks he can hold his own with doctors.It is extremely painful to admit this, but he does have charisma. It's just that his money and position meant that he was protected from any character shaping criticism during his formative years. That's why you see such an extreme in people's reactions - they either think he's super likable, because they picked up on his charm more than his negative characteristics, or they think he's a fucking moron, because they picked up on his lack of self discipline. It is an extremely weird combination to have, because charming AND successful (yes, he is successfully, but in a slimy sort of way) people usually know the importance of maintaining a consist public persona.I'm from NY.

Kim wishes he was running a real country, trump wishes he could have military parades in his honor. They might just do a Freaky Friday and trade of fucking their respective countries up"
dves0tc,riegspsych325,"I am curious if this meeting and potential denuclearization will be ~~spun~~/used to set up for the next electionEDIT: grammar and perhaps ""spun"" is not the word to use"
dvesqiu,TuxedoJesus,"I mean, if he gets NK to denuclearize it's not “spinning” anything and I would think “hey I got the worlds craziest/most dangerous leader who wanted to destroy the world to agree not to” would be a pretty solid campaign pitch."
dvew9q1,mr_dontplay,"This has already been done. They did it for Clinton and Bush, and they took the money, and then they just resumed their programs.It's not an accomplishment any more than a bully at school offering to no longer beat up a kid for money means that the kid can brag about not being bullied anymore."
dveszro,Bocephuss,You are curious if the sitting President during a denuclearization of NK will campaign around that for reelection?
dvet8kj,riegspsych325,yes and if that is something that would significantly improve his chances for successful reelection
dveu1ww,Bocephuss,Well. The answer is a resounding yes. Regardless of who the President is.
dveufgu,riegspsych325,I guess it should have been obvious to me that that would be the case. Thank you for answering
dvesogt,smartredditor,"WTF would have to be ""spun?"" If Trump meets with Kim and it results in denuclearization, that's a huge win for the entire world. It would be worthy of praise and a great reason to vote for Trump's reelection."

dvetgsg,DicksAndAllThat,"Two T_D users posting withing 3 minutes of each other to circlejerk each other.Watch out for stuff like this folks, this is them literally crafting a narrative and brigading in real time."
dvetw86,FastThunder,You have a rather creepy obsession with T_D and people who post on it. A solid 80+% of your recent comments are complaining about T_D or insulting people because they have posted to that sub in the past. The rest of your comments are for League of Legends. I think you should find a productive hobby and try getting out more. Let go of your unhealthy obsession.
dveu53z,DicksAndAllThat,"[There's actually just a RES extension you can get which tags people who post on trash subreddits automatically](https://www.reddit.com/r/masstagger/comments/78gtap/res_broke_mass_tagging_so_i_made_my_own/). It helps spot brigaders, concern trolls, and people who argue from bad faith or circlejerk to create a narrative like above.Thanks for your advice too. You should probably save it in future though."
dvevbox,FastThunder,"Weird. That extension doesn't seem to include any left wing trashy/overtly bias subs whatsoever, like r/politics and r/blackpeopletwitter. I'm all for an extension that tags people from all hate groups, but if it's clearly biased then it loses all merit. You aren't helping your case much."
dvevm8g,stonedsasquatch,You leave r/blackpeopletwitter out of this mister
dvewc3r,,[removed]
dvewib3,FastThunder,"Lmao, if you can't see the rampant racism in BPT then you must be either blind, ignorant, or biased. It isn't as racist as T_D, yes, but it is still a hate filled sub that deserves to be on that list."
dvexs25,mr_dontplay,"Most of it is pretty light-hearted. Bring the sub up and look for yourself. A few comments here and there are always going to happen, but cmon now."
dvevta5,DicksAndAllThat,"What are you rambling about? It simply tags people who post on trash subreddits. [Here's the list so that people can judge for themselves](http://13.59.240.164/subs.txt).You might not consider T_D, Incels, or WhiteNationalism to be trash subreddits worthy of having their members tagged, but rambling about it ""losing all merit"" because it tags folks from those and not Politics or Blackpeopletwitter is bizarre and non-sensical. Let the people decide for themselves if they want to use it."
dvew04d,FastThunder,"I do consider those to be trash subreddits. You seem to be missing my point. If it only tags people from subreddits that don't align with your political views, and ignores the hate subs that do align with your views, then it isn't a hate filter. It's just a portable echo chamber. I already saw the list, which is why I decided to call you out on it. I already know that it does not include a single subreddit anywhere left on the political spectrum."
dvexymd,mr_dontplay,"Politics and BPT are not hate subs. The subs he's talking about are hate subs, and they're for worthless pieces of shit. I don't use a filter, I just know where I don't want to go."
dvew3mz,DicksAndAllThat,"What are you rambling about ""hate filter""? It simply tags people who post on trash subreddits like T_D, Incels or WhiteNationalism.You're not ""calling out"" anything. You created your own strawman and then you attacked it."
dvew8yv,FastThunder,"Oh, I see. Your tactic is to ignore my argument, refuse to make a productive counterargument, repeat a completely irrelevant sentence, then cry strawman. See? Echo chamber mentality. Or maybe a Russian bot?"
dvewfn7,DicksAndAllThat,">Oh, I see. Your tactic is to ignore my argumentIgnore the strawman you created to attack? Yes, why wouldn't I ignore that? It's your strawman. You started rambling about ""hate filters"" despite the fact it simply tags people who post on trash subreddits and doesn't filter anything."
dvewo61,FastThunder,"Filters don't have to hide content from the user. This extension is still technically a filter, as it tags every user who meets a certain criteria. As it is an extension that filters through users and tags the ones who have posted to hateful subs, the term ""hate filter"" seems like a pretty good name for what this extension is attempting to achieve. I don't understand how you don't see that."
dvewstb,DicksAndAllThat,That's great you consider it that.
dveud8u,Lonota,Im gonna use that
dvf25sn,ClaxtonOrourke,Says the person who spends their free time scouring the post history of a stranger Sorry bro that shit will never not be weird.
dvf4ik9,FastThunder,"Someone who complains about other people's post histories are simply inviting people to look at their own post histories as well. And think the word ""scouring"" is wildly innacurate. It took me about 45 seconds of skimming through his post history to see that he has a problem. So I wouldn't exactly call it ""spending my free time"" either."
dvf9kk9,ClaxtonOrourke,"It's still fucking weird. Reddit can try and normalize it, but it's still stalking.In fact Im blocking your weird ass. Should've done so first."

dvetz4l,TuxedoJesus,"*adjusts tin foil hat* AKSHUALLY It was just a mere coincidence. But there's no changing your mind, I already know."
dveu9hm,DicksAndAllThat,Sure. Two T_D'ers trying to spin a narrative by ignoring all the obvious problems with this meeting and saying that's smart. While the top comment is a T_D'er complaining this isn't on the FP despite being a 30 minute old thread at the time.Just a mere coincidence.
dvet116,riegspsych325,"I probably should have worded it differently, and I do agree denuclearization would be great for everyone. What I was wondering if this'd be something that would enough for any politician involved to get better chances in their next respective election"

dvet28p,DicksAndAllThat,Would only happen if Trump appeases NK by removing all military prescence from SK.Basically showing that all Kim needs to do is flatter Trump to get him to demiltarize their enemies.
dveugtw,Lonota,"Thats my concern, one is that kim is gonna bow out and backstab us again, the other is to get trump to agree to an effective surrender instead of a white peace agreement. Honestly though id still be good with it as long as south korea remains not controlled by the north."
dvetyji,dimebagCFH,"Sorry I'm too deep in the narrative and I'm looking at how Russia benefits from this. My terrible, based on next to nothing theory is that Russia wins financially in this situation and gets some heat off Trump when he most needs it. I'm in deep lol.

World War II is still a fresh enough wound for the older Koreans."
dvf4wwm,Hakasauars,I always thought World War III was going to start because the North Koreans would hold Dennis Rodman as a hostage for ransom money which would allow the U.S. an excuse to go to war.
dvf8bal,PragmaticStatistic2,So Rocket Man is not as crazy as Trump implied?
dvf8szg,gunner-est2004,"As strange as this sounds, i get the feeling they could be best friends. Like that stranger at a bar who you hate based on a gut feeling (yet deep down its because you hate their face.) And it turns out you're actually soulmates"
dvf9b3h,ianme,"In other words, North Korea has nukes, time to start treating them like a nuclear power, instead of a wanna be nuclear power."
dvf9bs9,Beachdaddybravo,"The most ridiculous thing is, if KJU decides to make a deal because of starvation, Trump will claim he ended the North Korean threat and that he's a hero. He's literally going to walk into a best case scenario that has nothing to do with him and act like he orchestrated all of it.Or war breaks out. Either way, even if the orange clown doesn't fuck up and decides to take credit for doing nothing I don't really care. He's a fucking retard but if KJU stops acting like a nut job that's great for the entire planet, and that's bigger than what any of us think about Trump."

dvfdfn4,FreakinKrazed,Sooo what was chemical they used to kill his brother at the airport?Would be quite the irony if NK ends up assassinating the current US president via “The Interview”'s plot line.

dvffote,JohnPoe,"Taking this news with a giant grain of salt. Trump already lied about talking on the phone to Jong-un (it was South Korean president Moon), lied about getting a letter from Jong-un (verbal message, passed on by South Korea) and already backed down from his position of only meeting with Jong-un *after* they ""denuked.""The State Department and the DOD knew absolutely nothing about this and were completely blindsided. He just poked his head into the WH press room and announced it because he knew he had to change the narrative. I have no doubt this was all about keeping Stormy Daniels off the front page of today's NYT and WaPo, and he succeed."
dvffupl,unsafeatNESP,probably should bring Rodman along
dvfga3n,Max_Thunder,"I said multiple tines last year that the whole NK tension was bullshit and only a plan for Trump to look very good because he is going to ""solve"" the NK situation. Maybe even somehow influenced by Russia which is on NK's side.The biggest deal right now will be winning the midterms. The timing is perfect. Republicans will have a win, and the scene will be set for Trump's reelection in two years.I sound like I'm wearing a tinfoil hat but come on guys, I predicted this Kim Jong Un-Trump meeting about six months ago."

dvg908q,Coffman2768,"I love how you can wrap your head around the idea that Trump isn't educated. I agree he isn't much of an orator, but the man graduated from Wharton and took a million dollars and turned it into billions. How is it exactly that one man who took on Hollywood & MS Media, ended 2 political dynasties, and proved every expert wrong is considered dumb? Serious question."
dvgdci6,JaqueeVee,"The US education and election system is bought out by rich people. PS i am not a democrat nor a republican. Not even american. It's just very obvious how it works though, and how corrupt america really is."
dvgdnzm,Coffman2768,"Complete deflection. Didn't make an effort to respond at all,yet Trump is the uneducated One? What other obvious views of yours have been wrong recently. Haha, what crow you all will eat."
dvgdykl,JaqueeVee,"I mean, is it hard to understand how unqualified he is for a political position? No experience or education in the field, all he knows how is to make profit by using other people. Not a great quality for the leader of the free world, IMO. You might not agree tho. That's fine. I find him deeply immoral, considering both his pre-presidency history as well as his current... actions."
dvgehua,Coffman2768,"Fair enough. I'll concede that his actions before presidency could be seen as a huge character flaw. I too saw him.through the lens of the media when I was younger. Considered him kinda baffoonish. That aside, he has shown Excellent capability in making things happen. While there may have been several wrinkles to iron out in the Whitehouse his first year, he has accomplished more of his agenda at this point then any other president in history. His approval rating steadily climbs against holly wood, the late night shows, and the big tech companies that are supressing conservative content. Especially in regards to Trump. The tide will turn. You can't hide or misconstrue results forever. Once the American people see him for who he has become, i believe there will be ""red wave"" similar to Reagan."
dvgfirz,JaqueeVee,"Well, I highly disagree with all your points. Especially the approval rate point you're trying to make. I haven't seen a single credible poll that points towards him being very popular at all. Voter turnout in america is, without trying to be rude, pretty pathetic. For a country that prides itself on ”freedom and democracy”, yall sure don't exercise it very much. Trump won by accident, and by corruption and an obviously flawed election system. Do you honestly think that Trump is the most qualified and ample person for the role of President? Regardless of who he was running against. The American system as a whole is the problem, not necessarily Trump or the GOP, or the Dems, as I see it. It is deeply flawed and completely owned by those who already have money and power. I think that Trump (with the help of a lot of external powers) simply used those flaws in order to aquire power, and to put themselves in a better position financially (this being proven by the multiple leaks of Trump admin people, including Trump himself, using their positions in order to trade with, for example, Russia and the middle east). PS i'm fucking drunk as fuck so non of this might have made any sense so uhmmmm sorry if that's the case"
dvggvea,Coffman2768,"I drink enough to know that sometimes it makes you articulate things better. Well, to a point. I disagree whole heartedly, but fuck it. Cheers. I'm sure we both hope the best regardless."
dvgh2pb,JaqueeVee,Honestly as a non-American I just hope yall dont start WW3 which will effect the entire world. I do not trust Trump with ”the bigger red button” what so ever. America has basically become a giant joke/meme to the rest of the world since Trump won. I guess that was kinda the goal tho.
dvgim66,Coffman2768,"We have tariffs in place as of 2 days ago on steel and aluminum. North Korea has come to the table to discuss denuclearization. Isis is decimated. Syria was more or less resolved, and was taking citizen refugees back in before the new year. How is that a joke? He gives you headlines to joke about on late night because he is easy to hate. Do t misconstrue that for ineffective. What would Trump have to do to change your opinion? Again, serious question."
dvgkdf2,JaqueeVee,"Your production is moving abroad despite the ”america first” narrative, the current admin's tax reforms is meant for hugely wealthy people's tax cuts, ISIS is not decimated in any way so idk where you get that shit from, your country is still terrorizing a large part of the world and continues selling arms to terror nations such as Saudi Arabia. Syria is not ”more or less resolved”, that is a total lie, or you do not know wtf you are talking about. The DPRK are doing ”peace talks” because of increased sanctions on the country, and the leadership does not want the country to completely die, and need the trade with other countries in order to survive. Trump is a moron, and easy to fool, and Kim sees his opportunity in this (especially since he knows that Trump admires his leadership, as trump has personally expressed before).The ”headlines” you're talking about, more than often comes from actual recorded statements from Trump himself, be it Twitter or basically any camera appearence he's ever made. You've turned into a giant meme. Literally no-one in their right mind outside of America thinks that your current presidency is a good thing for your country, or the world. Your diplomatic influence on the world has severely, and objectively, deminished since he was elected, even resulting in US officials asking other world leaders to ”ignore Trump”, as he does not know what he's doing. And honestly: he just doesn't. He gives nonsense answers to easy questions in order to annoy them. He takes credit for other people's work, and he's lived his entire life as a spoiled little boy. The fact that people would put their trust in a literal con-man is honestly shocking to me."

They fight their wars the same way now too, using ""non-linear warfare"". An enemy that you never know what their goals are or what they're up to, is an enemy that is the most difficult to fight.

dvfls66,azhillbilly,"But Trump hasn't put a single bit of pressure on Russia or China? He let Russian sanctions expire on his desk. The tariffs won't have any effect on Russia as they don't sell steel or aluminum to us. And frankly tariffs are paid by the receiver. If China sends 100 dollar steel ingot to the US, it's still 100 dollars in their pocket. It just becomes 125 dollars when you buy it. The top import categories from china in 2016 were: electrical machinery ($129 billion), machinery ($97 billion), furniture and bedding ($29 billion), toys and sports equipment ($24 billion) and footwear ($15 billion). Why not put tariffs on machinery if we wanted to hit China where it hurts? I don't think the tariffs and the meeting has anything to do with each other. But I think Trump has been more vocal about the North Korea issue and all the past presidents have been isolating NK where Trump has talked about meeting with Kim before and it's actually possible to happen now."
dvfmt1e,RickyMissile,"Hint, look for energy deals in Eastern Europe and the Balkins. The fact I have to spell this out for you shows how shitty of a job the media has done representing reality. Also, 50% of our steel originates in China and gets to the US through other countries that are doing other processes, converting ingot, making sheets, etc. this forces a coalition of other countries against china. Why do you think we opened up an application process for countries to not pay the tariff. They will be forced to not use Chinese steel if they want to avoid the tariff. Get smart!Edit: Spelling, see comedy below."
dvg25uh,Cruril,> 50% of our *steal* originates in ChinaTIL that half the thieves in the US come from China.
dvfq9ek,azhillbilly,"Yeah yeah. You feel superior because you read conspiracy sites and feel more informed than the rest of us. Got any credible sources?You know what's real? Steel and aluminum prices are going through the roof right now and my shop can't bid on work effectively and we are having to go back to the customers with a new price after we buy the material and if the cost goes up, we are going to see layoffs. If Americans are losing jobs left and right who gives a shit about Russia or China. We are already on shakey ground and dealing the manufacturing community a blow is going to cause a hell of a recession. You may not work in manufacturing or even have a job at all but those of us that need to work don't want to be fucked over."
dvfwhen,RickyMissile,Work in aerospace and defense in manufacturing. This isn't conspiracy this is what is really happening. Get smart! We buy a lot of aluminum. We are seeing the affects of the market and some prices go up of course. But you adjust. Their won't be a recession though. People all over the world are feeling what your feeling.

dvf8cu1,chellis,Not in reality. A war with the U.S. would be catastrophic to china's economy.
dvfd7nt,Toolset_overreacting,"Not necessarily. In August of 2015, after NK emplaced box mines on a SK patrol route and things were looking pretty hot and escalated to the point of an artillery exchange, China stepped in and sent a very subtle message. China moved a few thousand troops and a mechanized Force that looked specifically designed to destroy the NK border guard. This was a big deal because China didn't mobilize their Air Force or Navy. The message was “Look, SK, the only way we'll get to you is if we storm through North Korea and our forces meet in the center. We aren't preparing a force that is capable of direct action against you.”China's only interest in NK is keeping a buffer state between a very large concentration of US forces and themselves and maintaining what the current status quo is. China has stated that they would only become involved if SK and US forces start the war. If China did join in a war that the North started, the US would invoke article 5 of NATO so fucking fast that our heads would spin. There goes a good 70% of China's production and trade.

He could offer blowjobs in exchange for lifting sanctions, and go right back to his country claiming Trump bowed to him.Reports suggest that thanks to all the sanctions and freezing of foreign assets, Kim's personal fortune is quickly running dry. If this is true, Trump stands a very good chance of getting the ball rolling on reforming North Korea because Kim simply doesn't have much of a choice - He can start playing ball with the US and remain in power, or he can go broke and probably have his inner-circle turn on him once they start going hungry."

dvfa4am,insanePowerMe,China annexes north korea. USA launches several attacks on chinese navy for revenge but isnt able to immediately launch an invasion due to mobilizing and planning issue. USA hesitates to start a total war due to the size of china and blames mostly north korea for the death of the president. South Korea attacks North Korea with the help of the US and sees major success until they reached the newly sent chinese army before reacing the capital of NK. China drives South Korea back and China offers North Korea to South Korea under the condition to form an economical union with china and demilitarize North Korea and send US soldiers out of Korean lands. Korea agrees and unites with economic help of china to easen the trouble of the north korean people. Korea becomes gradually more and more dependant on china. USA without its ally strikes some chinese ships and calls it a day. Claiming having great victory and revenge against the true evil Kim and North Korea. Conveniently ignoring china.

dvf7l75,Teantis,"I was primarily being humorous but for real, SK doesn't really have the resources to deal with essentially pulling a failed post feudal state after the war into the modern age. And no one can really say what the north Koreans want or not, a state that internally stable despite the incredibly oppressive conditions for a vast majority of people has enough powerful people with control over their power bases and stake in the status quo that a post decapitation war is not going to be neatly as simple as a 'liberation' war would seem.The US government, both civilian and military institutions, and the US populace has consistently underestimated how complicated and difficult post war circumstances are going to be in its wars since WWIIGeopolitically we also can't rock in and rock out. Not if we want to retain SK as a key ally, because China is there pushing against our western pacific rim alliance system all across the board. So our choices become: abandon reconstruction and reintegration to SK alone (who will almost definitely have to turn to China for help), or try to do state building either directly or in directly through contributing resources to SK for millions of people with next to no familiarity with the modern world, or knowledge of any governing system except the repressive Juche system."
dvfd035,LurkerInSpace,"> SK doesn't really have the resources to deal with essentially pulling a failed post feudal state after the war into the modern age.I don't think South Korea really needs to throw enormous amounts of resources at North Korea to get it on the right track:**1)** South Korea is a very attractive country to invest in; under RoK control the North would be as business friendly but with much lower labour costs - it would be a pretty attractive place for foreign investors, and easy to get rapid economic growth.**2)** The RoK would need to manage the movement of North Koreans for a while, since a lot of them moving could put pressure on the South's public services, but providing public services in the North itself isn't that expensive - labour costs are extremely low compared to the South. That said, anything which hands out commodities like food would not benefit as much from these low costs.**3)** The biggest expense would probably be repairing and upgrading all of the North's transport infrastructure, but the South's transportation would probably only need to increase by about 20% to manage that - again due to the very low costs of North Korean labour.> enough powerful people with control over their power bases and stake in the status quo that a post decapitation war is not going to be neatly as simple as a 'liberation' war would seem.Maybe not, but East Germany had a similar number of powerful people with a stake in the regime, but it was still swept away. One could also say the same about the Confederate States during the American civil war. The solution is to integrate those influential members of the North Korean state who can be integrated, and purge the rest (which dictatorships do anyway). Most of the state's workers are there because working for the government is the only way to have a good standard of living after all.In short, I think fixing North Korea would be difficult, but China has fixed itself (economically anyway) without needing to be joined to much larger and wealthier nation."
dvfdu0c,JollyGrueneGiant,I think the N. & S. Korean disparity is much worse that between east and west Germany. And it would cost a lot more to turn the economic sector around there than it did in East Germany.
dvfe1ms,LurkerInSpace,"The North would be very attractive to investment though - for the same reason South Korea was. Remember, it wasn't that long ago that North Korea was the richer of the two countries, but now South Korea is 20 times richer per capita."
dvfh3aj,JollyGrueneGiant,"It was pretty long ago, what's more impressive is the time frame that South Korea built their wealth. The problem is mostly that the people there are very uneducated, that wasn't the case in East Germany. There's always potential in an untapped market, but it's gonna take a lot of resources before the point is reached where a profit can be turned. And the burden of that is gonna be placed on South Korea, and I'm not sure they are going to be willing to take the same steps that Germany did after reunification. Germany is still taking a solidarity tax on everyone to fund the east, and it's almost 30 years after the fact."
dvfdr5v,Teantis,"I think #1 is wildly optimistic and the ensuing points only slightly less so. Post-conflict, post-genocidal nations take a long damn time to fix. The emergence of NK from being a pariah state will be unparalleled in modern history. Much much milder examples like post Tito Yugoslavia and Cambodia, struggled, and in many ways continue to struggle, for years or decades."
dvfdzjv,LurkerInSpace,"It's not *that* unprecedented. South Korea was itself a war ravaged nation after the 1950s - Seoul was beseiged and captured on four seperate occasions. Both Germany and the Soviet Union were also devastated by war, but both did recover over time.I don't think that it would be an easy ride, but North Korea under the control of the RoK would not be like Cambodia or post-Tito Yugoslavia. In both of those instances there was a lack of strong institutions or rule of law, and corruption was rife. South Korea's institutions are strong though, and they could make North Korea an attractive place to invest.Fixing all of those psychologically damaged people is another issue, but that is something which Germany has dealt with - after *both* dictatorships."
dvfeaip,Teantis,"Obviously we have a difference of opinion here, I respect yours I just don't agree. I don't think SKs institutions will be applicable to an entire country that is unfamiliar with them. Institutions (I mean in the political science sense of the word not just functioning government bureaucracies but the ""structures or mechanisms of social order, they govern the behaviour of a set of individuals within a given community"" ) work because the population is familiar with them and accords them legitimacy to a certain extent. North Koreans will be thrown into an entirely alien world that will be bewildering in comparison to everything they've been familiar with. That's going to take years, perhaps generations to fix. They'll end up violating those institutions both intentionally and unintentionally in myriad ways, and in terms of actually integrating them into a state, how is that handled? N Koreans probably can't be given the ability to vote for quite some time, plus any capable administrators will likely have to be swept out due to their necessary complicity to exist in the current regime, but if you put south Koreans in charge and the north Koreans don't have a vote, how is it different for them then an occupation? And they may react as such. It's going to be wildly destabilizing however it's handled and I just do not see things going smoothly like the Germanys did. And I'm not entirely sure SK **actually** has the appetite for it either, whatever the government says for politeness sake. But that's sort of another discussion anyway."
dvfr3v5,Selfweaver,"> I was primarily being humorous but for real, SK doesn't really have the resources to deal with essentially pulling a failed post feudal state after the war into the modern age.Ah but interest rates on long term bonds are the lowest ever, and a Korea rebuild to the standard of the South would be easily able to pay the loans back. Remember SK was _fucked_ after the war. Heck the US could guarantee those loans, which would mean the cost would be even lower _and_ there has got to be massive opportunities for growth in NK."

Collapse of the country would be disastrous to most nations in the region. Everybody would be fucked to some degree."

The devotion is perhaps even more devout and religious-like than it was in Vietnam by the time the Americans and their allies were there in the 60s and 70s.You think the South Korean security services are going to be able to organise 10s of millions of North Koreans to visit Seoul on a guided tour hastily enough to prevent it from being bombarded with all sorts of weapons targeted at it from within North Korea?

But North Korea has the benefit of seeing that autocracy ""work"" for 60 years. People are starving and defecting. I don't see them putting up much of a fight after the central military has been destabilized. And America's big thing is air support, not armor. They would just keep bombing and bombing.

dvgluoo,Need_More_Gary_Busey,">And America's big thing is air support, not armor. They would just keep bombing and bombing.What do you think happened in Vietnam? The US dropped more tonnage of bombs on North Vietnam than US bombers used dropped in all of World War 2. Ok, they avoided invading North Vietnam, but the bombing was still not enough to bring North Vietnam and their Viet Cong supporters to their knees. How decisive have the USSR and the US and its allies found their air support to be in gaining control over Afghanistan? You make a good point about how having Cambodia and Laos greatly assisted the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong, but I find it very hard to believe that China will be happy to see the US engage in massive amounts of bombing right on their border, without providing at the very least, some back-channel support to those still resisting the Americans in North Korea."

dvf8ouy,Books_and_Cleverness,"FWIW, we actually had tons of success forming SK into a modernized, prosperous society.(1) Common culture, identity, language and institutions before we showed up--Afghanistan and Iraq really were not this way, especially not Afghanistan.(2) Actual geographical boundaries that made historical sense, besides the 38th parallel. By contrast, Iraq's borders were drawn by some European dudes with a ruler and a whiskey-soaked map and maybe not the biggest concern for cultural nuance"
dvf8vb3,Teantis,"We had a lot of success with SK, but SK also went through 30+ years of military dictatorship with a lot of repressiveness with our support. Some of that has had ongoing effects on the society (like say the recently deposed president, ex dictator's daughter, and her whacky culty shit)even disregarding that small caveat. The divergence from post WWII korea over the past 70 years cannot be ignored. Whatever has been done internally in NK to keep that place stable, we probably don't even know a tenth of it, but whatever it has been has probably been incredibly distortionary to chances of forming stable institutions post war, a populace that is able to stably govern itself, or developing modern competitive economy that can actually function as part of the global system.I wouldn't look at Iraq as a parallel actually. I would look at Cambodia. They only had 4-5 (5ish because even though Khmer Rouge didn't take PP till '75, they controlled most of the country by that point anyway) years of crazy, genocidal dictatorship and look how difficult they've had it in the post war years. They're even backsliding into dictatorship again now, amongst many other problems. And they're relatively a success story, in comparison to the circumstances they came from.There's also the major geopolitical complications due to NK's position between a US security ally and China. Which incentivizes both powers to influence the succeeding state and in the process, undermine their institutions and sovereignty, whether that's a united SK, or some sort of more stable, more open NK."

dvf3re3,The_Apple_Of_Pines,"Is that an issue? I hate Trump, but if any foreign power attacked the POTUS, regardless of who it was, I would be completely on board with retaliation."
dvf71x9,LITER_OF_FARVA,It's not a matter of being on board or not. It's an act of war and there'd be no other option.
dvfa8sd,Hyndis,"Even China would realize that NK had gone too far. Such an act would be completely and totally indefensible. NK would have gone completely off the deep end.China might even offer the US military assistance should that scenario occur. If there's one thing China absolutely cannot stand is instability. Attacking the POTUS directly or taking the POTUS hostage is an enormous level of instability, and it would also enrage the US into immediate military action. At that point you either offer assistance or get out of the way and stay really small and quiet until the carnage is over."
dvfihto,matsu_mac,"Not just China, practically the entire world would offer military aid to the US in that circumstance. The leader of one of the most powerful nations on the planet being assassinated/kidnapped by NK would tank world markets and cause worldwide public outrage."
dvf3swd,lilpharmatic,Oh yeah what I'm saying is that Pence is as distant from the republican party as Trump and his MI
dvf3z4v,The_Apple_Of_Pines,Ah okay gotcha. Thanks for clarifying
dvfbl7v,ultranothing,"Damn right, whatever we want. UH. MARE. IH. CUH!"
dvf5qsy,lrapturel,Nah he would just blame the gays.
dvfav7s,BlueWaterbottle24,Yea but they'd be heroes to a lot of people. A rep in Missouri has openly called for Trump's assassination and /r/politics would collectively jizz its pants.

dvf0hor,Plazzed,This. If Trump so much comes back from SK with the sniffles every missile that belongs to the US is going to be aimed at NK.
dvf25ay,Capcukc,"kinda scary, if trump were to ACCIDENTALLY die in NK from natural causes we would *still* reduce them to ashes"
dvf2ltv,Plazzed,I mean you could say this about any president dying in any meeting with any hostile country since our inception.

dvfan9f,ShittyWok-,"None, but like now, the US had a stockpile.

dvf9hne,Anything13579,You're really underestimating North Korea. Remember what happened when the US underestimated Vietnam?
dvfhvku,phillipjfried,Trump doesn't have the balls to go through with the meeting. First comes the grandstanding then walking it back while blaming everyone but himself.
dvfcewa,PoliticalShrapnel,Trump has made a lot of enemies within the FBI. Couldn't they take him out then blame it on N. Korea? Seems the perfect scape goat.

dvf2u4u,scoobydoobeydoo,"Just a reminder of history:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agreed_FrameworkWhere the US got North Korea to agree to stop trying to build nuclear weapons in exchange for immediate aid. Secretly of course, North Korea built a uranium facility and started enriching uranium.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-party_talksWhere North Korea agreed to start talks about complete demilitarization, freeze their nuclear program in return for some aid and normalized relations. Secretly, of course, they built a nuclear weapon and tested it."
dvff0pb,FirmaLenB,"Now its NK who wants to talk to the US. That's a BIG diffrence. So far, its fair to say that US policies under Trump are better for the NK relationship then any previous policy. Also, secret services/satelites/etc. where not as good as they are now. So doing something secrerly is way harder nowadays. Lets see how this conversation goes first. Really lookin forward to it."
dvfhg4r,PhoenixAvenger,I thought NK has always wanted to talk to the US as an equal but we've refused to do so without some major preconditions?
dvfoim5,djm19,"They have always wanted meetings with us, and any opportunity to bring more legitimacy to them on the world stage. This is a big ""get"" for Kim. Antagonizing them has NOT been a successful policy. The one thing that could ruin all possible talks is Trump's policy.

dvesa2p,Crankyoldhobo,Oh wow - 4 threads (that I saw). Choice comments:> Why would this meeting get my hopes up? NK has nothing to do with impeachment. ----------------------------------> Dictators want trump to stay in power. This is the reason for the ass kissing.---------------------------------> Now I'm beginning to see the plot take shape. Putin will orchestrate this through a proxy.------------------------------------> He's going to Fuck any chance of diplomacy.---------------------------------------> Trump better not get a damn Nobel Peace Prize out of this.---------------------------------------> I am deeply concerned by this.
dvet6yp,Road_Kill_dinner,I disturbs me when people are vehemently against creating relations with foreign powers. Why is diplomacy and working together bad? Why do these people want him to fuck it up and send us into a war.
dvewamj,eilletane,Well communism has a few perks. Key word is few. Please don't kill me.
dvewisa,Road_Kill_dinner,"I'm more of a big picture kind of guy. This working out means less chance of war, meaning less chance I get called back to service to have to go deal with a war."
dveyemr,eilletane,"That's a small picture. You're just thinking of your well being and not the state of your country. But yes, less chance of war = better for the world world."
dveykg5,Road_Kill_dinner,"Little bit of both don't you think? Cake and eating it too or something. I have tons of friends who are still in, and as whole don't want anyone to have to die if they don't have to."

dvesew6,lazyassdog,"Really? Cause I see a dozen or so articles on it with comments all over the place, as one would expect from a story like this. Hardly universal, or that diplomatic relations are bad. Not sure what that means..."
dverdzy,pwellzorvt,It's on the front page of reddit. I am from the future.
dvf1362,JennaLS,It's not going to happen. I feel that is a guarantee. NK is all about posturing.
dvf27zx,vanishingspy,"I'll believe it when I see it. These guys are so full of bullshit, who knows if they will actually meet, let alone one on one."
dvfbw05,JennaLS,Yeah I wonder which one of those two idiots are more full of shit? 🤔
dveplar,Mig_Whsiperer,"What people are ignoring is that the South Korean leadership was reaching out to the North while Trump was attacking them. And there were probably several US civil servants who kept the peace as well, and those people deserve recognition. Just because Trump is the face of the executive branch doesnt mean he speaks for all the workers or for our Allies."
dveq97v,Dday82,"The article says “While he was speaking to reporters who had gathered to hear the news, Chung said that Trump's ""maximum pressure policy"" and leadership, along with international solidarity, had brought the countries to this point.”I'm not a fan of the guy, but I'll give him credit where credit is due. And as you stated, plenty of others were involved, too."
dveqlzr,Practically_,Is this Russia? They gave NK some nuke stuff right? Like for reactors and weapons research and stuff? Or am I tripping?
dveuxvd,Mig_Whsiperer,"So you admit you don't understand what he said?Solidarity means that everyone gave support.He thanked the entire world.You didn't even read your own quote, or you don't understand English."
dveza9r,Dday82,"You must be a hit at parties. Seriously though, if your blind hatred for someone forces you to never acknowledge the good things he or she does, then no one will ever take you seriously. You seem passionate about your beliefs and I respect that, but insulting people's intelligence when you're challenged will only turn people off from what you're trying to say. That being said, your original comment implied that everyone but Trump should receive credit for this meeting. If that wasn't what you were saying, then I apologize for the confusion."

dvh7b4y,patsmokeswii,So I see one got myself a little stalker.
dvetjpo,LlamaLegal,"No, it's not. Not directly. They are not equals. Is NK a world power? It is now. Do you think giving audience to someone suggests their status and importance? Or not?But yeah, I guess there are a lot of similarities... now that I honk about it."
dvevl7g,Crankyoldhobo,> now that I honk about it.We should all spend more time honking about this.
dvevs8r,patsmokeswii,"I guess we should just say fuck it and let NK keep building and testing nukes, and hope they don't launch one at anyone."

dvewkv8,patsmokeswii,"Well what do you suggest, Mr genius?"
dvewu6c,LlamaLegal,"Keep enforcing and increasing sanctions. Offer aid for disarming. Enter into a nuclear deal, like with Iran. Lots of options."
dves7a8,wittyusernamefailed,"If it keeps us from having to bring ""Freedom and Democracy"" to said dictators countries and get mired there fro decades, sure! The odds that these talks will go any different than the many we've had with NK over the decades is slim; but talk is better than war any day."
dvetn6k,LlamaLegal,When's the last meeting between a sitting US president and a leader of NK? I forget...
dveu1u9,wittyusernamefailed,"There hasn't been to my knowledge. Which means several Democrats and Republicans, held the course of not directly interacting with the NK and it has brought us to the point where they have a viable system to hit the mainland with nukes. Obviously a change in strategy is called for."
dveud3e,LlamaLegal,"Why? They're not gonna nuke anyone. If there were why would they talk to anyone, and not just do it?"
dvev4x8,wittyusernamefailed,"I don't know if your just a troll, you don't study anything about this conflict or what. But i'll try to go into why NK has a military first policy and has maintained making nukes despite agreeing many times previously not to. First there is an Orwellian state of pemenant war between NK and America, they are Always still at war and everyone grows up knowing that an invasion is ""immenent"". This is a control mechanism as much as any real belief by the elite, but their actions seem to show that on some level they believe their own propaganda, and the Nukes are there to counter that threat; imaginary as it may be. Then there is the blackmail aspect; NK is bonecrushingly poor and technologically backwards, with true famines just a way of life. And so NK has settled into a routine where it makes overtures such as this one, in exchange for food and other such aid, then goes back on their word. It's almost expected, but the real danger of the Nukes and war is a powerful bargaining chip. Lastly The Kims position in power is dangerous, he has survived several attempts on his life so far, and has had to purge many rival. And the very real fear is that he may lash out and start a war if only to rally the people around him. Or even worse that he falls and the country descends into chaos with millions trying to flood into SK or China; which would be devastating to eithers economy. In short talking and trying to deal with NK is safer than alternatives."
dvew4mc,LlamaLegal,"So. Yeah. They're not gonna nuke anyone. It would not be in their interest. I'm not misunderstanding anything. They got nukes under Trump, and he's gonna convince them to give them up? How? And why him? Why not his delegates?"
dvewcn5,wittyusernamefailed,"Probably because he's egotistical enough to believe that he, the half writer of the ""Art of the Deal"" will be able to somehow succeed where every President since Truman has failed. Though seeing how just using delegates hasn't done anything I say sure give Trump a shot. Don't think this will work, but at this point anything that keeps us from military action in Asia is worth a shot, Hail Mary Pass though it may be."
dvewihs,LlamaLegal,"It's not a Hail Mary pass. If military action is taken, it will be by us. We're the aggressor right now, not NK.I just worry this makes NK feel legit. I mean, shot. A full on dictator sitting down with the leader of the most powerful country on the planet. Man, so much winning, I'm tired of so much winning...."
dvex61h,wittyusernamefailed,"The problem is that NK has even in the past decade attack SK several times without provocation, sinking ships, shelling villages... usually due to famine and the need to force the world to give aid. And so however remote, it is not out of the realm of possibility that NK would use at least the threat of a nuke strike as leverage. Or that Kim could use a war as a means to prop himself up, using his nukes as a way to force acceptance of an NK invasion(how many cities would the U.S. be willing to trade for Seoul) The problem is that Kim is not very stable in his position, and lacks the skill in leveraging diplomacy into aid that his father had. His intentions or how far he would be willing to go are unknown."
dvf3dp1,CheesePeddler,And what do you propose? All-Out War? Sanctions that goes nowhere? Destabilization coups?
dvf3kxy,LlamaLegal,"Sanctions that go no where sounds good. I mean, what's the point of disarming them now? What happens if they rearm later? Attack them? Or just sanction them again?"
dvet1bo,Road_Kill_dinner,"YES, 100 TIMES YES!!! Talking is civil. Talking can get shit done. Talking will prevent me from getting called back to service, and possibly prevent a world war and a new draft. Like how was that even a question?"
dvetpcx,LlamaLegal,"Does it matter who does the talking? If so, why is it good that Trump does it?"
dveu40j,Road_Kill_dinner,"Because he is the President. He is who the people of the nation (through the electorial process) elected. The U.S. and NK have been at each other's throats for the past almost 60 years.The leader of NK wants to meet. Sending anyone else would be an insult equivalent to saying that Kim isn't worth the time and attention of our nation's leader.Kim wants to talk. That's something that Obama, Bush Jr., Clinton, Bush Sr., Reagan, Carter, Ford, Nixon, Johnson, Kennedy, or Eisenhower couldn't get a NK leader to do.The South Korean's have stated that Trump's policies directly influenced Kim to want to meet.This is big. The first meeting between a U.S. President and a NK leader."
dveui4g,LlamaLegal,I think those parentheses should be an asterisk.Did they try to talk directly to NK?And it is big. Big for NK. It'll think it's a world power now. And I'm not sure it'll be wrong now.
dvevfde,Road_Kill_dinner,"Some did, some didn't, and regardless of how you or anyone feels about it, North Korea is it's own entity with millions of people living there, with its own government. The people have been oppressed constantly and this may be the first and only time we get a chance to help them without a ton (and possibly me) having to die."
dvew6tl,LlamaLegal,"Good that you don't have unreal expectations. I don't think you'll be visiting NK anytime soon, no matter what happens..."
dvewfk6,Road_Kill_dinner,"If we were to go to war in the next two years, I would 100% be getting called back to service as I'm still in the IRR and was in an extremely technical job (look up USMC job 2651). That's why I'm trying to be optimistic as hell lol."
dvewrsd,LlamaLegal,"I understand. I don't want war either. I just don't think this is the way to avoid it. I can see trumpet threatening Kim with military action if he doesn't disarm, fail, and then feel obligated to follow through. But i don't know shit about foreign policy."
dvex12p,Road_Kill_dinner,"Trump can be a lot of negative things, but I'm hoping against hope he'll use his ""genius IQ"" here and not mess this up."
dvf9h4h,drose427,"This is demonstrably false, every other president has declined the invitation"
dveu4h3,wittyusernamefailed,"Well it would have been good if Obama would have done it during his 8 years, or Bush, or Clinton, or Bush... but they didn't, so Trump is up to bat."
dveun16,LlamaLegal,"Why would hat be good? You think they tried, but couldn't? Or did they choose not to?"
dvevfpd,wittyusernamefailed,"They chose not too. The U.S policy has been to only have 6 party talks between state dept officials. The stated reasoning being that we did not want to legitimize the NK government or their nuclear arms. With a long list of (hereto unmet) requirements before any meetings between leaders would take place. But this policy has not had the effect of keeping NK arms capacity in check. They have in fact proven very capable of growing the technological know-how in house as it were, even with sanctions and making them a pariah state."
dvew9xv,LlamaLegal,Yeah. So now it's time time to legitimize them?
dvewq8p,wittyusernamefailed,"I'd say that NK being able to create a nuke( Hwasong-15) system capable of hitting most U.S. cities, and a warhead small enough to be carried by the system. Has forced the legitimization. Either we bite the bullet and talk as equals ( or at least as a superpower to a minor state with a friggen big gun), or we don't any continue on the path of belligerence and conflict, which will most likely end in a war. Circumstance has force the issue regardless of personal desires."

The article itself stated that South Korea told reporters that Trumps policy was a reason the North offered to meet. I dunno what else to say. I'm astonished myself. But it's right there.
dveswhw,mosotaiyo,"It wasn't meant as a comment that this looks fake... really was asking if it was real, because it seems fake.A meeting between NK leader and Trump is not what I would expect after trumps series of ""We will obliterate you"" tweets :P"
dvesxqg,itty53,"I mean it worked, I guess. So far so good."
dvfd0wo,noitsapen,"Seriously....and all that we get out of this thread is a bunch of shitty jokes and Trump bashing. I mean, I really do despise of Trump, but that doesn't mean he can't accomplish anything great.Sure, it has a high potential of leading to nothing, but anything other than that could most likely be historic, and yet the main theme here is ""lol, Trump is stupid!"" No real conversation...none! No talk about how North and South Korea joined for the Olympics, no talk about how their two leaders just met for a dinner meeting, and no talk about how Un now wants to meet with the President of the United States. Something IS happening. A country that has provoked the world with War and nukes for 60+ years suddenly wants to possibly cooperate and the top comment is ""OMG memes!"" Man this place sucks for intelligent conversation."
dvf8tsp,BrotherBodhi,"This whole thing just kills me.This may be the biggest political event of the decade. This is truly historic. And this has the potential to decide the fate of humanity, without any exaggeration. This is a meeting that *could* go down in history books as a truly important date in human history. So we *need* to send our most *competent, even-tempered, well spoken, intelligent, and respected representative* to this meeting.And who are we sending?*Fucking Donald Trump*Oh my god what a wild ride 2018 is already. Didn't think anything would top 2017 yet here we go!"
dvfacg0,Hyndis,It may be a case of only Nixon can go to China.Perhaps only Trump can go to North Korea.
dvfdw8e,DoucheMcDoubleDouche,Well we already tried sending Dennis Rodman...
dvf9mg6,C0wabungaaa,"I'm not sure it's going to end well. This is why; North Korea wants guarantees that the safety of its regime is secured. Only then they'll consider nuclear disarmament. I can think of only *one* thing that's worth giving up the nuclear bargaining chip for: the complete removal of American troops from South Korea.Think about what Kim has seen from Trump. From Trump's visit to China, Kim has seen that Trump can be easily wooed and flattered. Making him feel important seems like half the battle. What he's also seen is a leader who wants to turn America ever inward (if, seemingly, only symbolically). He's also seen many protests aimed against the new THAAD system in SK. Honestly, this is Kim's golden opportunity to try this. No leader in American history has been as susceptible to manipulation. No leader in American history has been flirting so much with ideas of American disengagement. And never before has the Kim regime owned such a strong bargaining chip. So all things considered, I think he's going to try to put Trump in an isolated position as possible (from advisors and such) environment and try to convince him to pull back from the Korean peninsula."
dvfvd8r,rorcorps,"Absolutely nowhere, since NK will obviously demand the US withdraw troops from SK."
dvex566,GottaGetThemSorosbux,Who is going in with Trump? Because he's not remotely qualified for this kind of meeting.
dvex7gk,JTPri123,He's the President.
dvexfht,GottaGetThemSorosbux,"What's your point? He's incapable of processing a complex situation like this. You send people with experience and detailed knowledge of US/N.Korea relations, not a blowhard who doesn't read."

dvf9ig9,socialismnotevenonce,"> He's incapable of processing a complex situation like this.First president to ever get NK to a talking table, yet you still insist on pushing the incompetence angle."
dvfd1uf,Antigonus1i,NK has been desperately asking forthis for years. Getting them to the table was not the issue. The issue is getting them to make a commitment to denuclearization in return for granting the the honor and recognition of a face to face meeting.
dvfj4he,offend-getover-fix,When was the last time they asked? Can you give me the last example? And why did the president then say no when the president now is actually trying to do something noteworthy about this for once?
dvfjmuy,Antigonus1i,"Because giving Kim a face to face meeting and treating him like an equal on the international stage is a huge symbolic achievement for the Kim dynasty. And giving them this huge deliverable should be met with a concrete show of good faith, which Kim has not done yet."
dvf4u7t,Wookie301,Trump is just going for advise on how to start a dictatorship.
dvf527r,JTPri123,...Right. Of course. Thats the most rational thing to assume.
dvf5m52,Wookie301,Or. I wasn't being serious.

dvf3i2l,CheesePeddler,Is it really critical thinking to want a democratically elected president to fail in a peace negotiation with a hostile nation armed with nukes?
dvf8n6e,trustworthy_expert,I don't think Kim Jong Un was democratically elected...
dvf8rdu,Schizoforenzic,Person with critical thinking skills doesn't want a democratically elected president to fail in peace negotiations. Person lacking critical thinking also lacks a basic understanding of how what you just said is subversive and plain fucking retarded.
dvf9msq,iksar,"Would be nice but I can't help but think that this is going to be bullshit. Make a backroom deal, come out and say they agreed to get rid of their nukes just in time to swing the midterms, midterms pass and nothing changes in NK and things go back to how they are now with GOP pillaging the US to enrich themselves. The regime assurance is for Trump not Kim. But if I'm wrong, it works out, and NK becomes peaceful then wonderful news!"
dvfpqkn,Hyperion626,im betting it has substantially more to do with Kim finishing his Nukes and the expectations of Kim that come with it than it does with Trump. highly doubt any Trumpets will see it that way though

dvfiu93,Ganthid,Rodman was even on the apprentice.
dverass,Thighbrush_Greepwood,I doubt it. Trump has such a huge ego and thinks he's such an awesome negotiator that he doesn't think he needs anyone's help or advice with anything.
dveth3t,Road_Kill_dinner,"In a way, the dude is a businessman, and he was a good one. His whole life is negotiating and dealing with difficult people.He had business that went under, but he made his money off of them and then let them sink. You don't get TV deals, business deals, and become president of the U.S. by being a bad businessman."
dvezpdy,Anlaufr,"By all accounts, he was a terrible businessman. The money he makes is as a result of cooperation with money launderers and other criminals. See the Panama Trump Tower where none of the lights are on but it hosts many ""legitimate"" businesses. If Trump had put his money in an index fund all those years ago, he would have more money than he does now."
dvfpbcj,highresthought,The index fund thing is a total lie. That assumes he put every penny back into reinvestment and spent absolutely nothing. It also assumes absolutely perfect market timing.

That's not even counting New York, Chicago, Nevada, Flordia, Hawaii, Ireland, Panama, Canada, and many others."
dverfni,itty53,"Oh he'd still take all the credit for it, don't get me wrong here.But weird thing.. Wouldn't he deserve a little credit here? I mean if it goes well. Cause he's gonna get the blame if it all goes to shit."
dveru0b,Thighbrush_Greepwood,"A little credit for not fucking it up, sure, if indeed he doesn't. But while he was promising 'fire and fury' and pushing us towards nuclear war, the south koreans were actually trying to deescalate, so it really would have to be 'a little'."
dvesb0k,itty53,"They literally cited Trumps policy in their reasoning for the summit. Dude. I get it. It's fucking crazy. But optimistically, this could be a historically good thing. It's a big step just talking. They wouldn't meet with Obama. This is actually progress already."

dvewhq5,TheGRS,"I'm also choosing to be cautiously optimistic, but in the face of a lot of problems this poses if it even happens. There's something to be said about giving NK credibility because they built a bunch of missiles and are threatening to shoot them at us. In the past we've chosen not to negotiate on that level, because its basically ""we'll agree to not shoot missiles at you if you agree to our terms"". But on the other hand the threat of nuclear retaliation wasn't as realistic until very recently. There was clearly some kind of opening during and after the Olympics and S. Korea jumped on it. So I'm choosing not to jump on the usual ""this is a terrible idea"" bandwagon right away, because clearly whatever we've been doing for the past 30+ years has lead us to where we are now, i.e. nowhere."

dvfeh8r,socialcommentary2000,"You're indulging in the same western-centric fallacy that ultimately got us into the quagmire that was the invasion of Iraq: If we just pay them off somehow, they're instantly going to want to adopt our style of institutions. There is zero...and I mean...ZERO similarities between North Korea today and how Great Britain evolved over the course of a millennia of birthright aristocracy. It took seven hundred years between the signing of the Magna Carta and the final act to enfranchise the common British citizenry to eventually get them fully to what we think about as a western liberal democracy. It goes without saying but there was an encyclopedia's worth of events, including an assload of twists and turns, to get to that final point. Short answer: You cannot buy this shit...and you cannot bring it to people by the barrel of a gun...it has to evolve organically."

dveyog5,wolverinesfire,"Look. North Korea has a habit of asking for things, making promises, getting some of those things, then breaking their promises. They alternate between threatening war and trying to negotiate. Trump has been fixated on things like building a wall on Mexico's border and getting the Mexicans to pay for it. Ridiculous and stupid. Trump wants a win. I don't think he will get a good deal. Who knows what will happen. I have little faith in both leaders. Are these talks better than war? Hell yes.

dvf8a8p,EavesthePayne,NK has been trying to have a meeting with the US President for 40+ years. The prerequisite for any such meeting has always been for NK to de-nuclearize. This meeting will only serve to legitimize NKs nuclear program (not to mention scores of human rights abuses).Meeting with Kim without the promise of any sort of concessions from NK is not a strong move. Maybe as a gesture to initiate dialogue you send an ambassador or the Secretary of State but you don't start off with the POTUS.Before anybody starts in with the claim that 'NK is going to suspend nuclear testing until the meeting'.It is highly likely that they were not ready to test anything new in the upcoming months.Not doing something you weren't going to do anyway is not a concession.

dvgppib,ihml_13,not really. its just a pr stunt for kim to meet the us president.
dvewl4h,ApollosCrow,"Depends. The Kim dynasty has always sought validation from the rest of the world - getting a US president to visit could be interpreted as a show of equal force. Past presidents have refused offers like this in rejection of NK's threats and atrocious humanitarian record.I see this as two autocratic nuts benefitting each other. They wave their dicks around and terrify everyone, then shake hands and both walk away looking like heroes to their people."
dvfhov6,stfatherabraham,This is important: NK inviting POTUS to talks is *not an unusual thing and is in fact part of NK's ordinary strategy.*

dvfat3u,Need_More_Gary_Busey,">This is fucking huge, more than you can imagine.Look, I think the prospects of talks is always somewhat encouraging, and that it is usually much better for potential adversaries to talk then not to talk, but you are getting way, way ahead of yourself. The North Koreans have stated a number of times in the past that they would be prepared to de-nuclearize in exchanged for regime security, and that they have nuclear weapons only as a way of maintaining nuclear assurance. North Korea has also sought on numerous occasions, direct bilateral talks with the US, but this has been rejected based on US policy of refusing bilateral talks until certain steps have been undertaken by North Korea. US policy for quite some time after the break-down of the Agreed Framework, was that they would only only engage in six party talks, which include other actors in the region. Guess what, during these six nations talks, North Korea also agreed to denuclearize when the Bush Administration was in power.>And now they are giving up such a top principle for nothing. They have given absolutely nothing away, they have only given words, and very similar words to what they have given a number of times before. The 1994 Agreed Framework was a very significant agreement made during the Clinton Presidency, whereby North Korea would receive aid and energy assistance if they did not produce work towards producing Nuclear Weapons. They did not fulfil their side of the agreement and they didn't fulfil their agreement from the six nations talks. Trump and Kim don't even have an agreement, they haven't even met yet.>This means some real serious shit happened to them, at the backstage. You are drawing conclusions based on what has only amounted to words and a seemingly new dawn for improved relations between North Korean and its adversaries real or perceived. There have been many other false dawns when it comes to North Korea's behaviour and posture. Having said that, there are probably domestic and backstage issues that are influencing this new posture of seemingly reaching out, as there have been influencing much of the different posturing to foreign powers and the international community that North Korea has engaged in at different times.>Maybe this is their usual dice-with-death bluffing but I don't think North Korea is stupid enough to choose the life-risking bluffing this time because it will cost their lives if it turns out to be a complete lie. I think North Korea is sincerely desperate to beg for life, and this didn't happen before, and we don't know the reason.You should have stopped at ""bluffing"". Why would this time be different in that them lying would result in them ""losing their lives""? How have you come to this conclusion? Based on what?As far as ""begging for life"", this is just hyperbole. NK are putting forward the possibility that they will be willing to negotiate. They are not begging for their lives. The regime knows that in a full-scale conflict with the United States, that they would mostly be obliterated, but they could cause some massive devastation to hundreds and thousands, if not millions of people, in exchange. They know they have chips on the table, and they know that others know that they have chips on the table.It is good to optimism but we haven't even got to the point of an official agreement for denuclearize that has been reached on occasions before, only for the DPRK to breach it. All we have is statements of intent from The DPRK, and we don't know why they are adopting this stance now. There is nothing concrete to suggest that this is anything different from the game that they have been playing for decades now."
dveyfkc,dont_take_pills,"As /u/justmadeaccount4 said, the sanctions Trump got China to agree to are having a serious significant impact.But something ignored is that Trump has been forcing North Korea to train militarily. Using fuel and food and money they don't have just to try and keep up.It's hurting them. It's hurting them to the point that they are acting outside of their normal behavior.And that means Kim is worried of either a revolution or a Coup.Kim is not worried about the United States, he's worried about internal factions.And Trump has pressed him so much that he either comes to the table or dies."
dvf62ds,SquirrelicideScience,"Damn. Idk if Trump had the foresight to know that simultaneous sanctions and egging NK on militarily would lead to this or if it was shear dumb luck, but credit where credit is due. Hopefully good things can come of this. But now that I think about it, if the trade is nukes for regime assurance, do we really want to back this regime? I personally think we should let them reap the crops this regime has sowed. If they try to nuke us in refusal for backing them, China has already said they would not help them or stop us from responding."

dvf1qch,ChiBears7618,"> Kim is not worried about the United States, he's worried about internal factions.This is accurate. I don't think Kim is crazy or stupid. Most rational people in his shoes would have done the same considering the situation. Living the high life and then BAM your people murder your brother on foreign soil and you're top guy now in the line. You fear for your life. So you play the game until you see an opening. You create small openings here and there as you can. But you play the game and stay alive. His nuclear shit is keeping him alive both internally and externally. His reported willingness to give up the nukes means he's more scared of internal problems than external problems. He's more scared of a coup than being removed ala Muammar Gaddafi style."

dvfe9yo,4DChessMAGA,Why not apply this mentality to his entire presidency?
dvffhp6,Sadistic_Snow_Monkey,"Every reasonable person hopes their president does well, as it results in the country doing well. Obviously there are people on both sides who don't do that.Now, while I hope Trump succeeds here, he has shown time and again that he doesn't quite understand all the nuances of politics and policy, world economics, soft power vs hard power. And, he seems to frequently disregard the advice of those that do. This tends to pull me towards the hope that he only lasts one term. Not that i hope he fails, just that I would rather have someone more level-headed in control of the most powerful country this world has ever seen. Our world has been relatively stable since WWII, but the edge we're balancing on can be easily dislodged and chaos follow. I'd rather not live through that and instead form relationships around the globe through diplomacy and soft power, as opposed to dangerous rhetoric and threats of war. Whether people like it or not, the modern world is a global one involving all countries working together. We have to find ways to make it work."
dvg717a,4DChessMAGA,"I really like this response. Thanks.We have been relatively stable since WWII, and I'm curious to hear what edge you believe we are balancing on. Russian interference? NK? Domestic political divide?"
dvgpfxo,Sadistic_Snow_Monkey,"I think rising tensions fueled by rhetoric from both left and right has potential to tear holes in the stability of society. People on the far left screaming racism for everything, everyone is a victim, and claiming conservatives just don't understand, only fuels hatred for them from the right. Even people who I know that are moderates are being turned off by The victim mentality that seems to permeate those on the left. The far right also disgusts these people though, so it's not like they're swinging in the opposite direction, they just see the ridiculousness all around. The rise in nationalism on the far right, involving rhetoric aimed at racial purity, echoes the evil of Nazi Germany (not trying to bring Nazis into this, but when they chant ""Jews won't replace us"" and blame everything on ""globalists"", it reminds me of every historical account I've read from Germany in the 1930s. Hard to ignore). Unless we suddenly all forget the horrors of WWII, people will always fight to the bitter end against this thought process, but none the less, the ideology is gaining ground.Unfortunately, modern social media helps fuel this divide. Yes, Russia is involved (I tend to side with the intelligence agencies of us and our allies, over the claims of anyone from a particular political party), and they're playing both sides. They want us in the west to be divided. It makes us weaker. The more we become divided, the more likely we can't reach a solution to a major issue, and the ultimate outcome could very well be war, whether with another nation or ourselves.We need to get back to being able to discuss and debate on an intelligent level. Understand the other side, and work with them to find what can be agreed upon, and not yell fake news at stuff we don't like. If we can't do that, we'll tear ourselves apart with our hatred for our fellow countrymen.Sorry for the long response."
dvgryu5,4DChessMAGA,"It was a good response. I agree with almost all of it. The idea of Russia, and other nations, using political divide as a weapon against the west is apparent. Social media and the inability to turn information off only drives people to be more entrenched in their beliefs. I took a month off from all social, and reentry was rough. Such a toxic space and the media on all sides clearly working a narrative makes you feel that a culture war is being fought at all times. It can be exhausting. This makes it easier for me to understand the sky is falling reeeeee living memes of the left, and the globalist trying to consolidate power paranoia from the right. The only part of your post I haven't experienced is the racial purity part. The fringe groups have always been there, but besides increased racial tensions due to the victim mentality of the left, I'm just not seeing this anywhere."

My prediction is that Kim will make some kind of slippery promise of slowing their weapons program in exchange for ending US sanctions. Kim gets to pose as a world leader equal to the POTUS, Trump gets to brag about “ending” a nuclear threat. Both assholes are rewarded for defusing the hysteria *they* created with their loony autocratic behavior.NK's missiles are deterrents - they've never been a real threat. Trump's getting bluffed, but at least it will chill everyone's fears for a while.

dvfomcd,Orange1025,"Lol what? Nixon scandal is far and away #1 as far as the biggest scandal in American political history (thus far) - it literally cost him his job! Only President to have to resign, that's an automatic top spotNot to mention that 'scandal' you're referencing was thoroughly debunked. We know Stone had legit FISA warrants on him long before the campaign started, they were re-confirmed on multiple occasions every few months because the investigation was baring evidence, and that there was no improper unmasking done at any time. Funny how the right wide media ignores that one party was actively conspiring with a hostile foreign country. Because **that** is the only scandal that will manage to top Nixon's, and the mountains upon mountains of evidence suggesting Trump will eventually also lose his job are staggering. But hey, keep turning a blind eye in sad attempts at the 'both parties are the same!' narrative. Twisting reality to invent made up scandals to get angry about to keep you busy from hearing the real stories. Maybe Hannity will show another car chase to distract people?"
dvfrixj,totallynotliamneeson,"Blows Nixon out of the water? What's with you people and just trying to find anything you can to hate on Obama? I can imagine that in 100 years conservatives will still be trying to spin it that he was some god awful president and basically a tyrannical dictator. Fox News' coverage of Obama was a joke, they would flip shit about his tan suit and the fact that he ordered mustard at a restaurant. I'm not even exaggerating, for the mustard thing the Fox News anchor said something along the lines of ""he wants mustard on it? That's not what us normal people get, maybe he thinks he's better than us"". Shit like that is why no one outside of the conservative community respects Fox News, they are ridiculously biased but claim to be fair."

dvjykz7,DannyDemotta,"So we're in agreement: just because some stations run silly ass stories, it doesnt mean REAL SHIT isnt going on.Obama was not some Christ-like figure who never erred, he had numerous fuck ups that the media flatout refused to amplify, knowing that future generations would Google their way to rewritten history. If the only outrage was on blogs and not venerable sites like CNN and Washington Post, then how true could those 'conspiracies' really be?The shit is all by design and people like you play right into it"

dvftgha,totallynotliamneeson,"You feel the media has been unfair to Trump, and that had they been the same way to Obama we would think worse of him? The media isn't being unfair to Trump, Trump is doing stupid things and getting caught on them. Obama never came out and called nations ""shit hole countries"". Obama never defended the actions of white supremacists marching and chanting. Trump won't even innact sanctions on Russia that congress voted on. Obama never paid off a pornstar that he cheated on his wife with. Obama was never caught on camera saying that he can sexually assault women because he's famous, admitted it and apologized for it, then turned around and claimed he never said that. Obama never tried to perpetuate a myth that the president was secretly not a citizen because of bullshit ""facts"" and not at all because he was the first non white guy to be elected president of the US. Obama never tried to start a trade war that even his own advisors were fucking resigning over because they were ignored when they said it wouldn't work. Fuck the list just goes on and on. Trump takes more ""abuse"" from the media because he does shitty things. But of course both sides are totally the same. Yup. That's why they tried to impeach Clinton because he said he didn't cheat on his wife under oath, so if both sides are the same then why aren't republicans trying to impeach Trump for his acts? It's funny how their ""morals"" go away once an 'R' is next to the name..."

I like how you specifically phrase this. *Come out*. Unbelievable.

dvf8i8z,Books_and_Cleverness,"While it will definitely be a great meme season, and I'm rooting for the man to defuse the bomb, it's worth noting that we tend to perceive historical events as caused by specific dudes in a way that they rarely actually are. I don't think Obama was somehow responsible for Qaddafi or Mubarak exiting stage left, nor was HW Bush responsible for the USSR's collapse.Tbf this may be more Camp David than fall of Mubarak so maybe the relevant personalities will play a bigger role than I am supposing here. But the way I see it, Kim saw what happened to guys who disarmed like Qaddafi and Saddam and he probably doesn't wanna end up like them, so if he is amenable to disarmament I think it's because so many years of sanctions have finally come to fruition and made his continued rule untenable without major reform."
dvfaf2p,Hotspringfever,Trump owns 500 businesses. Do you know how much of a seasoned fucker you have to be to manage all of that? He's been doing it his whole life. I'd hate to be in a negotiating room with him. Something tells me Kim is a fan of Trump and just wants to meet him. Everyone hated Rodman at his prime as well but he was a boss at the game. This situation holds a lot of similarities. I am crossing my fingers Trump see that and takes advantage of it. This is huge.
dvfcj6y,PoliticalShrapnel,"Ah yes, I'm sure he's a fan of the man who called him short and fat and rocket man. Edit: downvoted for this comment. I'd love to know how exactly people think he's a fan of Trump after Trump has insulted him so much."
dvfhom0,,[deleted]
dvfjp6j,PoliticalShrapnel,Great quote but that has nothing to do with my point that Kim does not like Trump. Would you like someone calling you short and fat if you were?

dvfkwjr,Ripnasty151,He understands it's all political theater?
dvfllq1,PoliticalShrapnel,"Ok? Again, irrelevant to my point. I'm not disputing this meeting, I'm disputing the redditors who think he likes Trump and wants to meet him a la Dennis Rodman."
dvfpjcn,Ripnasty151,I'm disputing your assertion that he hates Trump based on name calling.
dvft9ic,PoliticalShrapnel,"No one knows precisely what he feels, but it's more likely than not that he dislikes him. I would dislike someone belliting me in front of the whole world, but maybe I'm just odd like that. :)"
dvfudjk,Ripnasty151,"You're right in that no one knows how he feels for sure, so any discussion on the matter is pure conjecture. I happen to believe a desire to meet with Trump when he showed no interest in the past (with presidents that didn't mock him on the world stage) is an indication that Kim doesn't hate Trump. Perhaps that line of reasoning is a little odd. You can believe what you want :)"
dvfuj4k,PoliticalShrapnel,"It is not odd but it isn't logical. I would love to meet Hitler, however impossible that is, can we therefore conclude it is more likely than not that I like Hitler?Apologies for invoking Godwin's law but this is an internet discussion after all. :)"
dvfunv3,Ripnasty151,"Yes, I would say wanting to meet with Hitler would do more to bolster the argument that you like him than not."
dvfx0dx,PoliticalShrapnel,"I would disagree. It would be incredibly interesting to meet such a huge historical figure. Likewise I would love to meet Trump despite the fact I hate him. Don't treat the world so black and white.Besides, the fact is that there are many reasons for Kim wanting to meet him. For example, the economic sanctions are likely now finally taking their toll and their nuclear programme is not as advanced as they had initially hoped and to prevent the entire country crashing down economically and being unable to sustain itself they may be willing to compromise, and of course as the US is their biggest enemy sitting on the security council with a say on these sanctions, starting with Trump is the best way to accomplish having them lifted."
dvfjpry,JobieWanKenobi,He probably is because Trump was the only one to stand up to him
dvftcyh,PoliticalShrapnel,"You tend to not be fans of those who belittle you on the world stage, being stood up to or not. You can stand up to someone without belittling them; the latter tends to cause resentment."
dvfyxbu,JobieWanKenobi,"In a lot of cultures they don't respect you unless you do stand up for yourself. I've worked with a lot of Iranians for instance and they tend to think you're weak unless you're willing to disagree with them, talk back to them. They'll walk all over you until you do, then they see you as an equal."
dvfzg29,PoliticalShrapnel,"Do you belittle and humiliate those Iranians on the world stage by calling them little, fat etc? And being assertive and standing up for yourself isn't the same as trash talking someone with the purpose of making them look pathetic in international politics."
dvfsa2e,Hotspringfever,Trump never called him short and fat. Get your facts right.
dvfstui,PoliticalShrapnel,"You don't know what the subtlety of implication is do you? He brought it directly to the attention of everybody to say 'hey guys, Kim has X and Y negative traits but I won't mock him, even though this tweet is actually mocking him, because I want to appear to be the bigger man here'. You don't need much emotional intelligence to see it."
dvg0dn7,highresthought,A lot of people actually like to be called on their shit. They only respect strength.It's like two dudes who rag on each other at school and pretty soon they are a comedy tag team ragging on everyone.Kim jung un probably found himself highly amused that a us president would actually engage in verbal sparring with him.

dvfbs1w,Sell200AprilAt142,"I have a theory (it's not a great one) that at the highest levels of power there is pretty much a global consensus on how the world _just works_. It's not an agreement on politics itself, it's just a practical unprincipled common understanding of how things ""just need to be"". And I think reality is just a bit more amoral and commercial than most people ever want to acknowledge or accept in their leaders. I mean.. sure, I think people _know_ that the rich and powerful want to stay that way, but you don't often hear the point of view that trying to be too principled as an international leader might be a _hindrance_. And I think for that odd reason, Trump might actually be good to have talking to Putin and Kim. Not because he's not an arse. But because an exploitative peace is in all their interests and they'd all be happy to throw whoever or whatever under the bus to achieve it. (e.g. Trump to not care about Crimea / Syria, Putin to not _really_ care about the status of Ukraine, Kim to not _really_ care about NK economic principals etc etc). And so ironically, it makes the world safer, but more ugly."
dvffpu8,MidCornerGrip,"I have a feeling it's more because NK resources have gone to shit after their huge mine collapse. They could just be giving up and looking to gain something from it.Either way, Trump did not call this meeting did he?

dvf2p59,this_place_stinks,Generally agree. But is Trump crazy enough to actually retaliate with a military response if that happens? That's the wildcard. NK was reasonably sure the last 10-15 years that the US would not strike.
dvf6crd,Gunblazer42,"> But is Trump crazy enough to actually retaliate with a military response if that happens?No. He always seems to talk or threaten a big game but then back it down a bit. He might say at one point, if it goes that way, that North Korea would be going down, but he'd eventually be talked out of military action and probably just do sanctions again. We did have the whole hullabaloo with the ""fire and fury"" line and it ended in a whole lot of nothing in the end. I don't know if it's because he comes to his senses or if people behind the scenes manage to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't attack NK militarily.At most he'd probably just say ""Hey looooooook at these ships they're just hanging out over hereeeeee""."
dvfar9i,Chubs1224,In his Presidency he fired over 50 cruise missles into Syria over an attack on a third party and dropped the largest nonnuclear bomb in the US inventory to take out IS fighters in Afghanistan before they could build a real presence. The first one he did in the middle of talks with China. I think he may be willing to invade just to make the point that America means what it says. Hell it would likely be easier to pull out of then Iraq or Afghanistan because there is already a viable government in place with a trained military able to take over control of the North once the Kim Regime is knocked out.

The first one he did in the middle of talks with China.Both of those are more theatrical than practical and were ultimately measured responses, not accidents.I mean yes he glassed the Syrian airbase responsible for the gas attack with overwhelming firepower, but we also tipped off the Russians before the missiles hit so they could get their people out but not have time to move equipment. Hardware can be replaced, a couple dozen Russians brought home in caskets with a full state funeral is the type of thing that escalates a standoff. Likewise we publicly slapped Assad without seriously degrading his military capability or entrenching ourselves in Syria.The fact he did it from the dinner table with Xi is why China started cooperating."

The next move of historically rival powers in the region would be the removal of the hard power assets.Who are the key players here and what do they have to gain and what do they have to lose? The United States is in a position of power in the region, with military bases across the Pacific Rim. China has always been interested in the removal of American forces from the 38th parallel. Russia has a playbook to remove American influence from the region. I'm convinced that their next big move will be their offer of the Kuril Islands back to Japan, further weakening American influence in the area.No, I don't trust this at all. Something isn't right.

I got out last year, am unemployed by choice to focus on school, currently have a 3.8GPA, wife works, but is a teacher so after taxes and healthcare payments we only bring in about $26k from her income and I get $1300/mo while school is in session from the G.I. bill, so about a total household income of about $39k.We have our apartment, 2 cars(with notes), phone bills, etc... So things are tight but were making it, at the same time though not qualifying for a Pell Grant for the first time in 2 years hurts, thats $2.6k/semester gone.Anyways, sorry to ramble on you, thanks for the info and goodnight."
dvevwso,DistortoiseLP,"Tax bill was signed in December, it wasn't responsible for your returns this year save for a few very specific retroactive clauses (like flood disaster claims if your parents did so). Your parents more likely got a larger return because of a unique deduction that year, like moving.Finance legislation is cultivated. Much of what happens in the first few years of an administration is the product of the end of the previous one and so on. The seeds for the 2008 recession were sewn as far back in the 80's, with critical legislation all the way through the 90's and 2000s contributing to it. It's a long term game."
dvew4ue,Road_Kill_dinner,"That's interesting because my parent's place hasn't flooded, and they have lived in the same house since 2010. Everything is the same this year and they got back over $1200, last year only $43.I've done their taxes(on TurboTax) for them the past 4 years. (I've used TT for myself since about 2012, so it isn't like I've done anything different.)Figured their mortgage in and everything just like last year. I'm probably gonna go line by line and see if I can find the difference. I'm genuinely curious."
dvewhl8,DistortoiseLP,"It could also be that your folks overpaid their taxes that year somehow, such as their employer withdrawing too much. Bear in mind, a large refund with no explicit deduction is [not a good thing](http://time.com/money/4707300/big-tax-refund-irs-withholding/) - it's like giving the IRS an interest free loan, paid back without inflation. You want to be as close to zero as possible if you spent the entire year working one job and took no major deductions."
dvewqjv,Road_Kill_dinner,"Yea, I'm going to have to check it out. My wife and I get larger returns because we had military related deductions, as well as claiming unreimbursed moving expenses, classroom preparation for her, and tuition, book, and equipment costs for me for school (I just had to spend about $400 on equipment as an Electrical Engineering major, shit isn't cheap if you are trying to excel rather than skate by)."

dvfjazx,IAintThatGuy,"I mean historically he was the one who signed the independence and ended the conflict.But he was against independence for a long time, silent when the issue was controversial, then for the end of hostilities at a point where he reasonably had no other choice. Which felt like a huge betrayal to some of the French armed forces (who felt like the losses they suffered up until there were for nothing), and also the colonists living in Algeria (who were in a very bad position because with independence they'd either get killed or have to flee to the mainland with nothing, and a lot of them were farm or store owners).So disgruntled soldiers formed a ""secret army"" (they actually called it the ""organization of the secret army"", OAS in French) and they tried to kill De Gaulle at least twice. Since they were professional soldiers they didn't fuck around and had access to heavy equipment (and knew how to use it). They tried once with a bomb, another time they just fired at his car with automatic weapons. Both times he barely made it (and there was luck involved at least once because the bomb malfunctioned).He's recognized as a great statesman in France (for good reason he did do awesome things) but he was also good at doing things that were convenient. And kind of an asshole at times.And it's an issue where whichever stance he'd take would bring a lot of problems his way. The OAS guys were pissed off. But on the other side the algerians (and some of their supporters on the mainland) were also pretty good at terrorism and assassinations (at the time lots of them were WW2 veterans)."

Constantly telling everyone that you're intelligent and amazing, making every issue that you possibly can about yourself, and believing that people should believe you just on the basis of you saying, 'believe me,' makes you a narcissist. Or rather, it makes him a narcissist. I have no idea whether or not you are."
dveut89,theImplication69,Nixon was at least semi-competant. Trumps going in blind with his usual false information probably
dvf1yus,arti214,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_theoryDoesn't seem all so different.
dvf9gz7,TheThomaswastaken,"It was a bad strategy with Nixon, and a personality flaw with Trump. I'd still rather have a strategist, crooked Nixon would be better."
dvf9lcy,snipekill1997,Except you usually try to avoid acual damage when you're doing madman theory. Trump has been too incompetent on too many things that are of no releavence to the Korean peninsula for it all to be part of some grand design.
dvetoyr,marinesol,Nixon going to China was predicated by the sino-soviet split and the great leap forward. I haven't heard of any major split or event in North Korea that would justify such a moment.
dvf66xt,Danger_Zone_Duchess,"Its crazy how close the situations are. Nixon didn't like China, Trump doesn't like North Korea. Nixon did something out of character and tried to remedy their relations. Trump is doing something out of character by trying to remedy relations. Nixon was under investigation by the FBI and Trump is under investigation by the FBI. Nixon ended up being found guilty and forced to resign before solving anything with China. So lets see how Trump's situation ends up"
dvf9iom,TheThomaswastaken,Difference being that Nixon did it as a strategy and Trump just does whatever was suggested to him most recently.
dvffp1s,johnnymneumonic,Glad you're in the Trump inner circle to report back to us these bits of insight!
dverfrz,mrsuns10,I think that is the correct comparison Im pretty sure people thought it was huge that Nixon was talking to Mao
dvfez93,ReservoirPussy,Was Nixon the one that threw up on somebody during a state dinner while visiting China?
dvfh9wk,HarknATshaynik,"I think that was George HW in Japan. Under Nixon, Kissinger visited Pakistan and pretended to be ill so he could pretend to be ‘recuperating' for a few days when he really was visiting China, too."
dvgpmin,ihml_13,"most definitely not. for that, kim would have to be interested in giving up his bombs."
dveyphn,HoMaster,Lol you think Trump is as competent and intelligent as Nixon was?
dvf9hm7,TheThomaswastaken,You're right. Trump is a fumbling buffoon.
dvfg6cp,masbetter,"Nixon was actually clever, though."
dvf3zk3,Blehgopie,But it's more of a Trump goes to China moment.
dvf3ke7,Burnham113,"""I won't rule out direct talks with Kim Jong Un. I just won't,"" the President said. ""As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine.""- Trump"
dvfoh6a,Mandalorianfist,"Can you imagine if he pulls this off, he could get a Nobel Peace Prize... and earn it!"
dvg47uc,djm19,Except Chinese sanctions and South Korea's somewhat reset on getting a new dialogue going are the consequential actions here. Kim just wants to meet with the US president because thats a feather in his cap.

dvf80xo,boomdidiboomboom,"Agreed. If his talks with Mexico and Angela Merkel are anything to go by, it sounds too risky to me. Anything that's said that goes against his ego and his measured tone will fall apart pretty quick based on everything so far."
dvg6oap,AnythingApplied,"There are reasons past presidents haven't met with North Korean leadership.> “North Korea has been seeking a summit with an American president for more than twenty years,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at Middlebury Institute of International studies tweeted Thursday night. “It has literally been a top foreign policy goal of Pyongyang since Kim Jong Il invited Bill Clinton.”> This is literally how the North Korean film ""The Country I Saw"" ends. An American President visits Pyongyang, compelled by North Korea's nuclear and missile programs to treat a Kim as an equal.> PS: To be clear -- we need to talk to North Korea. But Kim is not inviting Trump so that he can surrender North Korea's weapons. Kim is inviting Trump to demonstrate that his investment in nuclear and missile capabilities has forced the United States to treat him as an equal.Clinton sent his Secretary of State. Bush and Obama both refused because of North Korea's unwillingness to meet preconditions which is a good indication that you won't have a productive meeting if they aren't even willing to consider the things you'd be asking them to concede in the meeting.> ""High chance Kim will pocket the optics, show his people and the world he is received as a legitimate head of state, and in the end keep his programs intact."" - Richard Fontaine, president of the Center for a New American Security[Source](http://time.com/5192579/trump-meets-kim-jong-un-north-korea/)Sounds like there is a good chance that Trump is simply handing Kim Jun Un what he wants and what North Korean leadership has wanted for a long time and there is a good chance we'll get nothing in return."

dvf0zz3,MightyBrand,Got a chuckle from me. In all seriousness I like to give credit where it's due. And if trump makes Nork a past issue then thank you Donald.
dverzed,kafkaBro,Hey it's really refreshing to hear this impartial dialog about this event. I think we can all agree that it would be nice if the meeting happens and NK delivers on their promise to stop nuclear tests.
dvf0hxa,Hawklet98,And it would not be nice if the meeting happens and these two unstable dipshits get into an ego-driven pissing match resulting in millions of deaths.
dvetp3s,DicksAndAllThat,Which would only happen with concessions from the US. Such as the US removing all military presence from SK.Showing that Trump is quick to appease dictators as long as they appeal to his ego.
dvexm63,kafkaBro,Hey I don't know where the down votes are coming from. This is a positive development and I'm looking for alternative perspectives so thanks for sharing! I will say I haven't seen any evidence that Trump is merely placating Un and some strings wouldn't be a deal breaker if it means the nuclear capability isn't built up more in NK.
dvetpt3,unknownunknown_,I had to search r/worldnews and r/news because it was weird not to see anything on the front page. Sad to see what this site has become.
dvewdk8,Serancan,Different news agency link on /r/politics https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/832fzl/trump_accepts_kim_jonguns_invitation_to_meet_over/?st=jejdore8&sh=f845afc5Course the thread is the usual r/politics circle jerk train wreck.
dvex7ah,ieandrew91,Lmao what the fuck. This is good news regardless of which side you are on and that place is full of salt and BS statements.
dvey1j1,Serancan,"/r/politics has evolved into an utter waste of time. There's no real discussion, nearly every submission just panders to the outrage culture and you either agree with the hive mind or be banned/downvoted into oblivion."
dvey9pb,FallsZero,funny thing that its one of the most viewed subs though
dvezmxp,Maxrokur,"Lots of people still believe in the ""imparciality of the media"" so is not a big surprise"
dvf3vzb,CheesePeddler,"I browse politics, and I have a very strong feeling thats its being brigaded by both sides - the DNC propaganda and the Russian trolls.A lot of the posts there are just so artificial."

dvex9ir,vanoreo,This is about the third post I've seen about this on the frontpage.

dvf3fy5,DhaosOfLorien,"They started tinkering with the algorithm so the average user can see top content from the day, which pushes a lot of content to the wayside.

dvf1ntw,ExorIMADreamer,"Seriously, it's ridiculous how nuts these people are. The thread has almost 4000 upvotes and is on the front page but if it's not there with in two seconds of posting it's some librul conspiracy."

dvfbbae,legaladviceukthrowaa,"It only has 5k upvotes on /r/politics, and its upvotes in this thread are far lower than you'd expect for news of this magnitude."
dvet2qc,DoktorSteven,That isn't how it used to be. Like 2 years ago Reddit was consistently scooping every news outlet.
dvewlfh,DicksAndAllThat,Thanks to T_D they had to change how the algorithm works. Now Reddit is slower at getting things to the FP.
dvewvbu,Dorian_v25,Aka Reddit fucked up their own algorithm attempting to censor a popular community.
dvewy3x,DicksAndAllThat,Shoulda have just done the right thing and banned it and all of its members. Would've kept the algorithm intact that way and not hurt other subs.
dvexmk4,Dorian_v25,"Reddit is home to thousands of different communities. If you have a problem with one, why can't you just ignore it?"
dvexvar,DicksAndAllThat,"It radicalizes young males into doing things like killing their parents, like the T_D user who murdered his father because he thought he was a liberal, and they urge their members to knowingly march hand-in-hand with Neo-Nazis, like they did in their stickied thread advertising Charlottesville for over a week.It'd be stupid to ignore a sub which is responsible for getting people killed like that."

dvfaxj7,sexrobot_sexrobot,"The big problem is he's too lazy to prepare a simple agenda and he's too incompetent to figure out how to even set preconditions. If anyone has noticed, Trump thinks summits are events where you just talk to people about whatever and you get your marching orders from Moscow and then everyone leaves.He thinks foreign trips are excursions to authoritarian countries where everyone adores you(or else) and kisses your ass. An actual diplomatic negotiation requires policy knowledge and the adherence to core principles. As we've seen, Trump's core principle is that he is viewed as a winner who wins. If Kim Jong-Un is willing to concede that rhetorical point, there's nothing telling what Trump is willing to give up."

dvf7lcw,hehemyman,He is the only president who blatantly calls out China for trading with N.K and sustaining their economy. He also imposed harsher sanctions. He also blatantly insults him lol which may have worked?The most important thing he did though was put the attention on China and how they lie to the world and secretly fund N.K.

dvfiq37,Killchrono,"> It gives tons of legitimacy to KimThis is the part that's baffling me about people being excited over this. Unless we find out KJU has secretly been preparing a plan to undo his father's legacy and become a benevolent dictator, the guy is still a spoilt political heir to a totalitarian regime with nuclear weapons and is viciously oppressing his people.I don't think anyone with a modicum of sanity has ever gone 'we absolutely *should* go to war with North Korea', but that doesn't mean the US should go the other way and appease them. It honestly feels like he's trying to cozy up to the US to legitimise himself both domestically and on the world stage, and Trump is just a gullible enough man to give him that without thinking of the consequences.I don't think this will lead to war, but I think this will only benefit NK. I honestly don't see any concessions being made on their part if this is approached without any demand of compromise."
dvg1z6d,k0sidian,"Trump is acting like adult here and realized that appeasement towards North Korea isn't a bad thing. Sure it will benefit North Korea more than the US, but if Trump legitimise North Korea on the world stage he will be helping a lot of people. It's a humanitarian victory for both sides."
dvgm19p,Killchrono,"*How* is it going to be a humanitarian win apart from not provoking a war that wasn't going to happen without extreme provocation anyway? Unless KJU changes his tact, all it's going to do is legitimise a totalitarian government that oppresses each it's people severely. This is why past presidents have ignored his father till now. They don't want to go to war with them, but they don't want to legitimise them either.Plus, the only reason Trump needs to break bread with NK is because *he provoked them in the first place*. This isn't him being an adult, this is the teacher telling a child to apologise to the fat kid he picked on and now he's acting like they're best friends. There is nothing adult or genuine about this, and that's why I'm sceptical as to how it will go."

Also Trump never said he would release his tax returns and is under no legal obligation to do so, not sure what that has to do with anything but whatever."
dveztqo,borwars,"Yes, you need to simplify it. Trump is a serial liar. He will never meet with Kim. And his tax returns were a big deal because they reveal his financial situation...you know, that thing Mueller is looking into. The superlawyer that specializes in financial fraud. Yeah, that guy."

dvfk4zj,MuzzyIsMe,"During the primaries and election, it was a very common talking point about how Clinton was going to be “tough” on Syria and Russia and was basically suggesting she was going to escalate the situation in Syria and Ukraine. Based on her record, I totally believe it and I think if she were in office right now we would be seeing a lot more US involvement in those regions. That is one of the main reasons I didn't vote for her. But, amongst my Democrat friends, it was almost hearsay to question her stance. I can't stand when people change their ideology simply so their side can win. Republicans do it and Democrats do it. I don't want the US involved in any more overseas action unless it is absolutely necessary. The cost in human life and dollars is insane. Biggest letdown i had with Obama, as well. He came into office promising to get out of the Middle East, which is why I voted for him twice, and he never did. I hope something good comes from this NK meeting. I find it unlikely, but you never know. Maybe a somewhat bombastic and frank character like Trump will resonate with them."
dvfkk8z,Lonota,"Agreed, though i do support the global involvement by way of diplomacy. I think the UN and nato are valuable tools that we would be foolish to discard. Im expecting 1 of 2 possibilities; kim stabs us in the back (like every time before), or kim wants to be recognized on the world stage. The latter im fine with, i expect trump to go for it for the sake of a policy win amongst moderates and independents. My question is would the gop go for it and potentially anger their conservative hawk base to appease the trump wing. They shouted down Obama on the iran deal for “constitutional reasons” but in order to actually achieve a treaty they would have to sign off on it. So thats something im curious about. What does kim want, and is congress gonna give it?"

If you're talking about his ""war is bad"" thing I doubt you'll find many pro-war advocates either way.My issue lies with Reddit's ""voting"" system which is not used in the way it's intended, frequently stifling discussion. I willingly admit I dislike our current president/administration, but I would like to see more healthy debate. That said, it's usually easier to read the article myself and Google more professional discussions (lately I've been interested in gun control).I think another detrimental factor is how Reddit is consumed.

I don't want to make assumptions, but it's possible to add your own thoughts without even reading the article which is harmful for back and forths.

dvf3f0f,Wheream_I,"Should of is a mishearing of the term should have. It is not something from antiquity, it is from someone not knowing the contraction of “should have.”Irregardless isn't a word, has never been a word, and anyone who uses it as a word is an idiot."
dvf3k0s,Meatslinger,"My point is that some people have read or heard “thousands of thousands” and misremembered it as “thousands and thousands”; I've seen it before and am merely playing devil's advocate. Language evolves in this way, whether for better or for worse; we don't have good, contemporary reasons for at least a third of the idioms we say/write, I'd conjecture; so many of them come from this collective memory passed down in a big game of “telephone” through the years.Also: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/irregardlessInformal language is still language."
dver4oe,Jayken,The DPRK isn't going to nuke anyone. Their nuclear program has always been defensive. The reason we don't want them to have nukes is that there is a real threat of them either being sold or stolen.
dveriph,Ironicalogical,Hasn't even been defensive. It for posturing purposes and leverage. And it's working for them.
dvewscl,Jayken,"It's both in a way. A nuclear weapon is the ultimate defense, and it means world powers will have to take your seriously."
dveshmw,ChildWorker,It grants them leverage on the talking tables.
dvfb3bq,lobthelawbomb,"Little column A, little column B."
dvet7sw,Temetnoscecubed,"your argument is valid, but it misses the fact that Pakistan is a bigger problem when it comes to your concerns, and nothing is being done about them."
dvewm9f,Jayken,I completely agree.
dvf65yt,Temetnoscecubed,"And incidently Pakistan was very involved in helping DPRK with their nuclear weapons program, something India was very vocal about, yet the ""west"" kept very quiet and did nothing while it happened, I wonder why that was."
dvf9i0b,coolwool,"Well, drone strikes kill a lot of people in Pakistan so you are doing a lot on that end. Nothing positive ofc but you are doing quite a lot."
dvezybw,Roadsoda350,Yep. We ran war games to simulate what would happen if the DPRK regime fell. We failed horribly and most of the nukes too so long to secure in the simulation they would most likely be stolen if something like that actually happened.
dverir2,PhoenixTwonkie,Really? I don't think all the military exercises with S.Korea are to stop a theft.
dvewq7h,Jayken,"They are cold war tactic meant to say, if you push your luck, we're prepared. The problem is that they are completely ineffective."
dvexidq,PhoenixTwonkie,">They are cold war tactic meant to say, if you push your luck, we're prepared. The problem is that they are completely ineffective.Yeah, they've been nuking us left and right and show no signs of wanting to negotiate. Totally ineffective."
dvexmss,Jayken,"They're not going to nuke anyone without provocation. Doing so would guarantee their demise. They might be an evil repressive dictatorship, but they aren't suicidal."
dvf7icm,PhoenixTwonkie,You've now completely contradicted yourself. Congratulations.
dvf9gxt,coolwool,"How has he contradicted himself? He first stated: they won't nuke anyone if not provoked. The nukes are a defensive measure and also a bargaining chip. Then he said: They are a cold war tactic. This is just the first point again, using a different term. He points also out that so far, they haven't really proven that they could actually make a nuke strike implying that there is still time that political pressure could prevent them from becoming a country that has working ICBMs. Lastly he just came back to the point from the first comment, using again different words for the same content. No contradiction in sight."
dveu0ve,munchies777,"I agree. First though, I'd like to hear it from an official US source rather than second hand from South Korea. Who knows if both sides actually agreed to it. Also, I'm curious what conditions will have to be met for the meeting to take place, if any.Also, I really hope it isn't just one on one. If there's a team of diplomats from both sides, then something good might come of it. If it is just the two of them though, I have my doubts.Edit: Never mind, read the article. Looks like Trump tweeted about it."
dvf6bqh,SquirrelicideScience,"From other comments, people are reading this as an act of desperation from the NK regime. I'm all for world peace, but this regime has actively maintained the poverty of their country, and now it seems some of the population is noticing due to the increase in military spending due to going nuclear. I personally think if revolution is coming, we shouldn't impede that. But I get what you mean. I don't know that its ethical to let the population reach desperate levels in order to force revolution, but it might just become another round in the cycle of ""we'll stop being fucks if you give us money. Ok here. Haha jk sucker WE GOT NUKES BITCH TRY ME"""
dvf3o4o,lightbot,What exactly is so special about it? What former president couldn't have done this? It's what NK has always sought. Literally a solo run by Trump based on no consultation with anyone. Trump has literally given NK it's biggest prize for exactly nothing in return.
dvf81ox,Minscota,Its never happened before.
dvfde8q,lightbot,By choice.
dvf7sbv,LeodFitz,"It isn't unpopular to think that this COULD be good, but the meeting hasn't happened. The outcome could be great, or it could be catastrophic. This isn't a 'worst case: nothing happens' situation. This is a 'worst case: War' situation. If they manage to de-escalate, great! But there's a lot to worry about here, too."
dvf4qqm,ColdFire98,You can't possibly be so naive to think that NK spent years and years building up their nuclear arsenal and bragging about it only to give it up so easily. I'll be surprised if this meeting even takes place. And not surprised at all if nothing comes out of it.
dvetye4,acme_insanity,"Its not the idea of peace that I find concerning, just who is trying to make the peace. Trump is notoriously impulsive and short sighted, at the very least, im more concerned about the potential fallout of his presence. Remember when trump met with EU leaders and literally the next day Angela Merkel did an impromptu speach distancing the EU from the US. He shows up, gets his ego on and says something stupid, and the rest of the world deals with the fallout."
dvf6242,hotgarbo,"There is no doubt in my mind that no meeting at all is better than a meeting with Trump. The probability of something positive is there, but incredibly small. The probability of something negative is almost fucking guaranteed given our current track record."
dvf9x5d,SpiritualButter,"That's my worry, look what he said about the UK, he pissed off a lot of people here. You really don't want to piss off North Korea"

dvfb13d,sexrobot_sexrobot,Your opinion is actually popular. My opinion will actually be unpopular. Any meeting without preconditions or a firm agenda is not only doomed to failure but rewarding the Kim Jong-Un regime for their brinkmanship behavior.

dvf20bl,capsaicinintheeyes,"100% agree.This in no way means I plan to refrain from cracking wise about it, though. Trump and the NK regime are arguably the two most absurd things on the planet right now, you can't ask me to ignore that when they get together!"
dvez99a,rain5151,"It's not that I don't like this meeting, it's that I find it *fucking terrifying*. Yes, it would be immeasurably great if we could negotiate NK away from its nukes; if we had a steady hand at the wheel I'd be ecstatic.Can we really trust that he won't have some insane thought pop into his head, go off-script, and throw everything into jeopardy? When working on something this delicate I want Trump as far away as possible."
dveraa5,currentcontext,Yeah man. This is great news for the entire world.
dveyb26,Gelsamel,I love that they're taking steps to address this issue diplomatically... I just don't think Trump is a good diplomat and might fuck everything up and draw my country into a war to support our ally. Many a war that neither side wanted was started over poor diplomatic performance.
dvergm7,PhoenixTwonkie,"No, that's a popular opinion. Most of Reddit can't get over their dislike of Trump to acknowledge something positive. ""But what about muh Russia collusion!"""
dvernov,vomirrhea,"Same thing. Relations were going downhill fast at the end of Obama's era. Setting aside any ""Russian hacking"" or whatever, trump has stabilized our relations with Russia. This is OK, we do not want another cold war (or all out war).And if anyone wants to use Russia's integrity as an argument I will fucking fight them because we have been allies with Saudi Arabia for forever and they are mega shitbags so fuck off with that argument"
dveueyp,Road_Kill_dinner,"Right? I think this is the first time in my life that I've seen major world players finally act a bit civilized and not want to blow each other up. But muh, ""not mah prezidunt"""
dveuz04,democrazy,As if there are no good reasons for 1 on 1 negotiations with an authoritarian. Obama and Bush were both invited to NK but they declined because acknowledging the Kim regime with direct negotiations with a president puts them on equal standing.
dvf8zn1,IrishRepoMan,Stop them from nuking some poor country? What makes you think they'd do that?
dvfaknl,alltheword,It is just beyond naive if you think this is going to actually mean peace or make any real long term changes. NK has lied and gone back on every deal it has ever made. What makes you think this time will be any different? This is a propaganda victory for NK.
dvfdpmo,Thirdnipple79,"I think most of the concern is based on a lack of confidence in trumps negotiating skills and North Korea's track record of not following through with agreements. I think it's fair to say that most people don't want a war, but after hearing Trump's conversations with the Australian prime minister and Mexican president, there is concern that this will not lead to a positive outcome.It's like a plan to get off an uncharted island and Gilligan is in charge. You want him to succeed, but you really just hope nobody gets hurt. Unfortunately, this situation isn't funny."
dvfede7,Blewedup,Serious question: what has trump done in his time as president or in his life to make you think we will come out of this better off as a species?
dvfhd9b,Gumby621,"Well the reason I'm rather worried about this meeting is that I don't believe Trump is competent enough to pull it off, and there's a very real chance it could lead directly to war. Of course, I believe it's more likely Kim just flatters him the entire time and suddenly they become best buds while North Korea just continues to do all the same shit they've been doing behind the scenes...which would also be bad but obviously not as bad as flat out war.Basically, there are a lot of ways this meeting could go, and many of them would be worse than the status quo we have today."
dvfhhoh,Twilight_Error,"All I'm thinking is ""Don't fuck this up."" Talks are a good thing. Much better than war. But I'm having a difficult time trusting the president with this. He does not understand foreign policy. He says and does too many things for immediate emotional gratification. And even though his advisors will be coaching him until the day of the meeting, once that meeting starts, everything that was said before gets tossed out the window.We've seen this behavior on a weekly basis for well over a year now. But for the most part, Trump's behavior has affected domestic issues. His meetings with foreign representatives have been fairly simple. All of that changes soon."
dvgpjp2,ihml_13,"except it wont bring peace. its just a massive pr stunt for kim to meat the president of the united states, and nothing will come of it."
dvhl73b,Likes_Shiny_Things,Thankfully it's a very popular opinion.
dvf2ke8,ClaxtonOrourke,"Nah fuck you cultist.POTUS antagonizes his own citizens daily. This fucker may make relations worse. Or at best Un plays him for a fiddle.Remember this is Donald Fucking Trump, not Nixon."
dvfezvu,justletmewrite,"I don't like this meeting. And I'll give you several reasons why:1. North Korea has a history of gaslighting everyone by claiming it will denuclearize and then not going forward. Their claim can only be taken seriously when they allow investigators back into the country as proof they want to denuclearize. 2. By taking Un at his word and taking his promise seriously, you legitimize him as a ruler. The willingness of an American president to meet with and legitimize a man who publicly assassinated his half brother and who runs concentration camps across his country makes the US look stupid and is akin meeting with Hitler after we knew what he was doing to the Jews. That's insane. 3. Whatever agreement is made, however illegitimate because the NK won't be serious about it, Trump is likely to use it to praise both himself and a dictator whose raw power he's been clear he admires. That's bad for everybody. 4. Why are you so sure that two men with fragile egos won't end up starting WWIII over this meeting? Why assume only the best can come from this? Have you been paying attention to how well things have worked out with Trump getting his own staff to come to an agreement, let alone another dictator?"
dvf8wp2,Relwolf1991,Some crazy liberals want to see trump fail no matter the cost

dvf2ehj,K-town-,NK has gulags and shit and you're entertaining the possibility that Donald Trump can set them straight. The meeting is a show for two autocrats to get a bunch of press

dvfozpi,Steven620,"Sorry about that, thought you were implying he would be removed. I don't think Kim will able to feign denuclearization with us anymore. Most likely Trump will lighten sanctions after their first meeting, but they'll still heavy on sanctions until they can verify extensive measures are taken to de-nuke.

Under these final rules, we will identify, on a prospective basis, individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act (Act) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) payments under title XVI of the Act and who also meet certain other criteria, including an award of benefits based on a finding that the individual's mental impairment meets or medically equals the requirements of section 12.00 of the Listing of Impairments (Listings) and receipt of benefits through a representative payee. We will provide pertinent information about these individuals to the Attorney General on not less than a quarterly basis. As required by the NIAA, at the commencement of the adjudication process we will also notify individuals, both orally and in writing, of their possible Federal prohibition on possessing or receiving firearms, the consequences of such prohibition, the criminal penalties for violating the Gun Control Act, and the availability of relief from the prohibition on the receipt or possession of firearms imposed by Federal law. Finally, we also establish a program that permits individuals to request relief from the Federal firearms prohibitions based on our adjudication.

dvf0eml,Minnesota_Slim,Because refusing to pay $4 for reddit gold is anywhere close to the income inequality that occupy Wall Street was arguing? Might as well equate people who say they wish they could pay for reddit gold for a comment to fucking MLK. The struggle is real!! People who say ughhh wish I could Reddit gold something wouldn't do it anyways if they were millionaires. It's a dumb ass comment making it seem like something so crazy they can't afford when they just flat out don't want to pay it and really just want the recognition like they did gild it.

dvf9nbg,coolwool,"""The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation[2] and a 'new climate' in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world."" And Obamas reaction to the price: ""Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a ""just war""[5] saying, ""perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars."""
dvf1nxq,Ridley413,"Dude mother Theresa got the peace prize, it's a joke."
dvfb169,CovertWolf86,Giving NK what it wants is a good thing in your eyes? Are you a troll or an idiot?
dvf4g4a,permatway,"Color me skeptical. I'm just a random idiot on the internet but it just doesn't make any sense to me that NK will trade its actual nuclear capabilities for theoretical regime assurance. There was an incident I believe in 2007 or so during the final phases of the six-party talks where the US delegates essentially promised the same thing, a peace treaty and economic aid and a written declaration that would have been signed by POTUS that the US will not attack NK in exchange for verifiable denuclearization. NK delegates (and KJI, KJU's dad) were mulling over the offer for several days, and during back-door talks with 'its side' (Russia and China) eventually told them they would reject the offer. Apparently, the Russian delegates were flabbergasted, their jaws dropped to the floor, they couldn't believe what they were hearing. They half explained half yelled at the NK delegates that such an agreement was more than ~~what the USSR wanted during decades of the cold war~~ what they considered reasonable and a signed declaration to not attack was more than what the USSR wanted during the cold war. Nothing has changed imo for what is essentially the same deal to be more attractive to the NK regime. In fact from the NK perspective it seems worse - they now have their weapons. It would be great for all parties involved if I'm wrong, I hope I'm wrong, but it seems to me this whole diplomatic offensive is just a setup to drive a wedge between SK and USA. Most likely NK will start by asking for a sweetener to attend the meeting, a loosening of sanctions or something, as an indicator of good faith. The SK side will almost certainly agree (left wing in charge, SK left wing are USA-skeptics, optimistic on NK and peaceful reunification), the US side will almost certainly disagree (right wing in charge, idealogically committed to the idea that sanctions are a positive force for change). Proposed talks will collapse on this point, SK and USA will blame the other, driving a wedge, which is what NK really wants.I hope I'm wrong though..."
dvfa8v3,shawnesty,"Labels self ‘random internet idiot' then proceeds to give cogent, empirical-based opinion that makes perfect sense.

dvf9lq0,duke_of_repost,"North Koreans aren't idiots and remember well what happened to Kadaffi. We (the west) are not exactly trustworthy party honoring our contracts. Even Russian know it, they removed nukes from Cuba on condition US removing them from Turkey (implied no short range missiles which can be used for first strike near each ones border), but 15 years later Ronald put cruise missiles all over Europe."
dvfaqid,Biolabs,To be fair Gadaffi was a fool for trusting his enemies. His fall was by his own hand.
dvfb2j1,CovertWolf86,There are exactly zero North Koreans who know who Kadaffi was...
dvfrzy3,SledgemyGlazz,"From the North Korean perspective, they've seen the US use the military topple Gaddafi, Sadam, Noriega, almost go after Assad, and try to get Fidel.Sadam supposedly had “WMDs”, so we killed him.Ghaddafi saw this and gave up all his “WMDs”, a decade later we still killed him.North Korea is better off with their nukes as a deterrent, our foreign policy is only proving it."
dvfxiqy,throwawayhrclinton,"I know I'm late and despite my support of Trump, I am very skeptical of NK. However, there may be things that we are not seeing and don't know about. For instance, Trump called out China for their complacency with NK and Trump just casually launched missiles at Syria from an iPad while eating dessert with Xi. Maybe sanctions with, again maybe, help from China are in fact being effective. I find the announcement of tariffs aimed at China to be interesting regarding the timing of this (Perhaps a warning from Trump to China, as NK would have serious problems without Beijing's support). Additionally, we just landed a hell of a blow on Russia in Syria and the Russians would certainly be considered a superior military as compared to NK. I would also mention that Trump, unlike his predecessors appears to be following through on campaign promises and has a very different style/approach to diplomacy than they did. Also, remember that the NK test launch site collapsed and that is all the more news we got from it.I don't know that we are, but I imagine that our NSA/CIA does their best to infiltrate their cyber systems and perhaps they have and screwed them up.So again, I am skeptical, but maybe the writing is on the wall and Rocket man sees it."

dvestam,Thank_The_Knife,You're ridiculous. As if Trump has just been a shining example of a great president and CNN has been super unfair. The guy's a racist piece of shit.
dvf9836,grooseisloose,What has he done or said to prove that he is a racist? Or is it just an unsubstantiated claim to slander someone's character?
dvf9qa2,TheThomaswastaken,"Banning Muslims from entry to the US. Attempting to end immigaration from “Shithole countries” full of hispanic and black people, while supporting countries full of white people “like Norway”. Arguing “both sides” when one side was Nazi white supremacists. Hiring only one black staffer in the entire White House. I'm lazy so I'm going to write etc. instead of listing the rest of his character flaws."
dvfa11z,grooseisloose,"1) It was a travel ban on citizens of certain countries on a list of potential threats for terrorism, which was actually created by Obama. The list is exactly the same as the countries Trump restricted. It did not ban every Muslim in the world from entering the country. 2) Didn't attempt to end all immigration from shithole countries, wants to end illegal immigration, which Dems were in favor of while G.W. Bush was in office. He shouldn't have called them shitholes as the president, but he's referring to their economic status and general quality of life. Haiti's is very low. Norway has a very good quality of life. It's the Left media that made it about race, not Trump.3) He should've condemned the white supremacists and not doing so was stupid, but he was trying to remain as neutral as possible.4) Should he hire people who are less qualified just because they are black? It wouldn't be fair to anyone to do that.The media tries to paint him as a racist every chance they get when in reality they ignore facts and resort to slander. Trump puts his foot in his mouth more than any public figure in recent memory, but that doesn't make him a racist."

dvfa2ea,TheThomaswastaken,Obama was a constitutional lawyer and would have never attempted a Muslim ban. Trump said he was going to ban Muslims before releasing the list of countries.
dvfa73w,grooseisloose,[Actually ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-us-canada-38798588) Obama did enact a travel ban. Trump's was just more broad after seeing the terror attacks taking place in Europe. The idea that Trump wanted to ban all Muslims is just factually incorrect.
dvfaofj,TheThomaswastaken,"> The Act, however, unlike Trump's much more broad order, only affected people eligible for the visa waiver programme, rather than suspend all citizens' travel from one of those seven countries.Trump and the Several supreme courts agreed that Trump wanted to ban Muslim travel. In the court of law, based on the facts, some of our countries highest legal experts worked together to address this question. Their answer was that Trump ban was immoral, unconstitutional, and un-American."
dvfa3i9,TheThomaswastaken,"Supreme courts ruled the multiple bans as unconstitutional because they were Muslim bans. It was illegal, immoral and Un-American."
dvfaa9z,grooseisloose,And after being [revised](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2017/12/04/politics/supreme-court-travel-ban/index.html) It was allowed to take effect again.
dvfau4m,TheThomaswastaken,"After being revised. What Trump wanted was illegal, unconstitutional and immoral. Do you think that what he ended up settling on was good for America? Consider the source. He president and his cabinet were so illiterate of foreign policy, one of their first actions was to write an unconstitutional executive order. They had to suffer six months of embarrassment and education before hey could manage to lower the Visa count to 50,000 per year from each country. Do you think those guys should be writing our policy when what they actually wanted was so blatantly unconstitional, immoral and un-American?"
dvfagy0,redrosebluesky,"immigration policy is under the jurisdiction of the executive branch, kind of like when the democrat president put japanese-americans in camps during WW2."
dvfaw6e,TheThomaswastaken,"So, you're saying? That the courts should ignore unconstitutional executive orders by the president? Because that's not what happened.

He's not only got his seat at the table, it's *his* table. KJU has all the leverage and our neophyte president who claims to be a “master negotiator” has taken the bait— hook line and sinker. Didn't even consult with the experts, just an immediate “yes.” This is a huge PR win for NK and has shown us to look weak and desperate. The reality is that NK has no intention of denuclearization, this is 100% a power play. It's also worth noting that NK and Russia are very tight."

We want one thing, they'd be stupid to agree to that thing, so I'm not sure where this goes.It's not as if we couldn't have met with NK face to face in the past. The reason we didn't is because denuclearization was a precondition.I hope this works out for everyone's sake, but let's be honest, if any other president had agreed to meet one on one with any dictator of similar repute (eg.

By keeping them forced in a corner we actually cause the 'hermit kingdom' to continue. The US has seemingly been against normalizing relations for a very long time.

dvfnsyt,PBUH_Was_A_Pedo,"I don't personally care if he wins or not. My point was that he's great at marketing to the right target audience. There are states where he still enjoys over 50% approval and will most likely carry him into his next term. His approval rating isn't any different than what it was before he won the election. He still enjoys the same support from 35% of Americans in key states. Not to mention 80%+ percent support among republicans. Despite daily dumpster fires. With this NK thing, he can simply say - ""look at me, other presidents have tried and failed..and I was the one that got NK to de-nuclearize"". Also, the GOP will never impeach him. Why should they? He's a gift that keeps on giving. Judicial nominees, tax reform etc."
dvfoxwo,Nurse_Hatchet,"He could maintain all of that support and still get crushed if democrats get off their asses and actually vote, which he and this administration are motivating them to do like never before (at least they are motivated at the moment, fingers crossed they maintain interest.)The GOP will milk him for all of those gifts until he threatens to engulf them in the flames. Then they will abandon him for the less pliant but more sane Pence. The rats are already starting to flee the sinking ship and he's seeing republican pushback on the tariffs.

dvetem2,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"Here's my crazy theory:It's not that he SCARED north Korea, it's that he ACKNOWLEDGED north Korea.Basically they've been desperate to create this illusion that they're a global superpower, and by simply acknowledging their existence, Trump gave them some legitimacy. You can almost think of North Korea as a crazy person that wants attention at any cost - good or bad. Ignoring them just escalates things.It is the opposite tactic of what Obama did with Libya. Gaddafi desperately wanted to be regarded as a world leader, and Obama gave him the cold shoulder for eight solid years. There's a book called ""Slouching Towards Sirte"" that gets into this."
dvf18bo,Midas_Warchest,Gaddafi died in 2011 so not 8 years. Also look at what has happened to Libya. Its a complete and utter shame and it was orchestrated by the U.S.
dvf20un,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"Absolutely. It was the number one thing that soured me on Hillary Clinton. She seemed so damn delighted to take him out, and it substantially destabilized the middle east.I get it Gaddafi was hardly a good guy, but I don't like to see the US meddling in other countries."

And they gave him a Nobel Peace prize..."
dvf26na,Not_My_Real_Acct_,"Agreed. And there's so many parallels between Gaddafi and Kim Jong Un. To a large extent, both had this inflated perception of their place in the world. Some good ol' fashioned diplomacy could have gone a long way in Libya. The United States has had a history of trying to 'choke out' these countries using sanctions, but I can't think of cases where it's worked. For instance, Saddam let Iraqis starve while he still maintained a high quality of life for himself. The sanctions hit the citizens hardest, not the leadership."
dvffibs,Nurse_Hatchet,"Not that I disagree entirely on sanctions, but I think maybe you stopped too soon. Citizens will eventually rise against their governments when living conditions get too bad for too long. Is it possible that's the real end game with sanctions, to encourage citizens to evict their own leadership so we don't have to or at least have local assistance in the endeavor? Just a thought. I completely agree that we need much much more in the way of diplomacy and less strong-arming everyone. Hopefully somebody rebuilds our state department soon..."

But for 25 years, we've communicated with Kim Jong Il via envoys and snail mail.Trump was the first president to open real time communication with Kim Jong Un (via Twitter.)Admittedly, it's all very WWE, but I think this has served to elevate Kim Jong Uns status.And realistically, that's what all these guys wanted. Kim Jong Un, Gaddafi, Hussein: they just wanted to sit at The Big Boys table. They're all billionaires, that don't care about sanctions, but they care about STATUS.It's all a giant dick swinging contest.http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/the-conversation/sd-north-korea-obama-past-presidents-20170810-htmlstory.html"
dvev3gw,Lonota,"NKs entire goal was to be recognized as a state, not to recapture the south, not to destroy the US.

Hell, in the 2000s, Libya was among the richest countries in Africa. He was elected the Chairman of the African Union, for god's sake.

Aside from the blip she will leave on the history of the United States, her only other mark will be on the willingness of other nations that we chastise to come to the bargaining table with us or accede to our will; Gaddafi did as much of that as he could in the 2000s (paying up for Lockerbie, abandoning WMDs, etc) and got stabbed in the pooper.Disclaimer: Gaddafi was a son-of-a-bitch, no doubt about it.

I would be remiss if I did not remind you that we have been down a similar road before (in 1994) and Washington's gleeful acceptance of their empty promises then achieved absolutely nothing. I would not bet on a different outcome this time around, either. Aside from the nuclear question though, are none of you even remotely uncomfortable with the fact that talks with the *President of the United States*, in person, would legitimize the regimes continued authority over the North Korean people; a population whose status could easily be misconstrued with that of *slaves*? Is that what we have come to? Bartering one protentional tragedy for an even greater one? One which has continued, unabated, for 70 years?I am not in favor of nuclear weapons being detonated in Seoul, or of watching artillery shells level that great metropolis. Nor am I in favor of the DPRK possessing such weapons. But I am also not in favor of pushing the needle further away from regime change, and if these talks happen and are successful, well, we may have to accept this reality as one of the many consequences."
dvfk4dk,,"Back in 1994 it wasn't a empty promises. They agreed to dismantle their program and even allow UN inspectors unlimited access in to NK under the condition that US and SK agreed to UN military observers in South Korea. They also agreed to pull back most of the military forces from the DMZ 50km as long at the SK and the US did the same and both sides would allow independent verification. They were also in the works of having the NK, SK, and the US pull completely out of the DMZ and to have that area patroled by contingent of military forces that were agreeable to both NK and SK. NK/SK/US negotiators also worked out a certain trust building exercises that all parties agreed in order to gradually implement these agreements. One these exercises was that US agreeded to send a token amount of oil by ship to NK once a month. At the time Clinton was President but both houses of Congress were controlled by the Republicans. The Pentagon was still shrinking due to end of the Cold War and was affraid that is peace occured in Korea that it might lead to base closing inside South Korea. The State Department didn't like peaceful Korea peninsula because they would lose leverage against China and Russia. So they spun the agreement as Clinton acting weak and appeasement. Generals and admirals were paraded in to Congressional committees to trash talk the agreement and make threats against North Korea. Congress also passed a series of laws that was tailored in such a way as to sabotage the agreement reached with North Korea. The result of all this was the White House was couldn't even deliver the symbolic amount of oil to NK. The NK took that as meaning that negotiations were worthless and continued their nuclear weapons program."

Sorry, Flynn talking to a Russian ambassador within his duties as National Security Advisor and Manfort doing work for Ukrainians before he ever joined the Trump team is a horrible Russian connection. At least if they found an intern with direct ties to both Trump and Putin they could stretch it enough to justify further investigating. But digging up trolls and campaign officials doing jobs inside and outside of the campaign amounts to nothing. Especially when the charges against Manafort have to do with tax evasion, NOT the Ukraine and certainly not Russia. And Flynn is being charged with lying to the FBI not colluding with Russians."

Either way, don't associate with known criminals and then act surprised when the FBI is listening in. Even Fox News acknowledges that Russia meddled in the election, to what extent we may never know.

dvfeqwd,Shattered_Deluge,There is no constructive purpose to your comment and it's clear it only serves to further divide people. Its better to view things objectively instead of unconditionally loving or hating Donald Trump.
dvg8jzq,TruthArbiter,"Contrarily, it serves to raise awareness that this Administration has policies that are positively impacting on Americans. Progressives might not like Trump, but it is imperative to be a critical thinker. To self-educate oneself about policies that are appealing across party lines. Whenever you hear Republicans screaming about something Trump is doing or failing to do....that's the time to listen up and see if there isn't something there that appeals to Progressives. Trump is clearly not a purist. He says things and does things that make Conservatives pause. And that's probably a good thing too."
dvfkqi2,,We can still unconditionally hate him.
dvg811s,TruthArbiter,"Try to think independent of MSNBC, NYTimes, WashPO, CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN propaganda. Be your own critical thinking person. Trump isn't perfect for a variety of reasons. But think hard about what policies he has either signed or initiated that help Americans. For example, Tax cuts, jobs, lowest Black is unemployment (ever), favorable trade deals, protecting the sanctity of our borders...the list is significant. Areas of concern however might include movement of the American Embassy in Israel. Trump's apparent narcissistic, bombastic approach is very, very different than what most of us have witnessed out of a President. Perhaps the only correlation would be Andrew Jackson. We all understand the Presidential shift in decorum and yes....we are and should question it as Americans. But let's not lose track of successes that are good for Americans ether."
dvhh0xv,,Death to Trump.
dvhppgp,TruthArbiter,That smacks of a threat. Don't go down that road. If you dislike the place that much then take an exodus from the country for a few years.
dvhi35m,,"The no-talent-ass-clown may have passed a tax bill for the wealthy and corporations and a pittance of a break for citizens which expire in a few years, however he has passed no significant policies that have effected ANY of the other things you speak of. Like, seriously, HTF can he claim to have had ANY impact on black unemployment? Or any unemployment??? What trade deals has he passed? What has he done to ""protect"" the borders besides sending out the Gestapo, I mean ICE to round up immigrants and fucked up DACA??? Quit trying to sound intelligent and thinking that 10 news outlets are just spreading propaganda. I get my news sources from a variety of places, I even watch FOX FUCKING NEWS for Christ sake. Trump will NEVER be thought of as a successful POTUS, no matter WHAT HE DOES, because at the end of the day, he's an awful pile of human feces who's trolling the country and doing irreversible damage to our nation and it's standing worldwide. Fucking stupid."
dvhpyrl,TruthArbiter,"Read the tax impacts for the individual and corporations. Put down the MSNBC koolaid and think for yourself. Look at the numbers.I'll grant to you that we should be suspicious of the Corporate tax reduction. But then when you compare our previous corptax (35%) vs. the industrial nation competitors corptax rate, you will quickly determine that 35% wasn't competitive. Not being competitive has an impact on all Americans (wealthier and poor...ALL). The high rates translate into jobs exiting the United States. Never a good thing if you want a job. There is a balance, but to be sure the previous corptax rate was absolutely hurting the average American.My call to everyone is to simply analyze everything you hear. Be your own judge. Self educate yourself. Think critically."

dvgb7q4,TruthArbiter,"You must be blind to the numbers. 313k jobs created last month alone. Lowest black unemployment...ever recorded. Signed a huge Corporate tax and individual tax reform bill presented to him by Congress. 3% GDP as opposed to an anemic 1.5% for the past decade. 90 trillion in stock market profitability, which of course translates into 401k accounts and adds to consumer confidence...which adds to spending. And the cycle continues.Don't be blinded by negativity. Trump is not perfect - clearly. He has flaws which challenge us all. Not least of which is the bombastic approach to the Presidency. He is different; not perfect; not all bad either. I challenge everyone to critically think about Trump. Good and bad. No different than what we did with Obama, or Bush, or Clinton, or Reagan...etc. the key to maintaining our Constitutional Republic (yes...we aren't a Democracy); is for the citizens to be educated. Not simple mental slaves of the State or tools of the media propaganda."

The USFS is already taking on timber crews for example. As a counterargument; job growth in 2017 was a 5 year low. > Lowest black unemployment...ever recorded. You still havent explained how Trump is, in any way, responsible for this. Might as well give him credit for the nice weather. > 3% GDP as opposed to an anemic 1.5% for the past decade.This 3% is a quarterly number. Between 2009 and 2016, GDP growth reached at or above 3% on a quarterly basis multiple times. This is the very definition of a talking point.> 1.5% for the past decade.This is misleading enough to be labeled a lie. Firstly, it never actually went as low as 1.5% under Obama. Though I suppose if you average the last couple years of the Bush administration into Obama's numbers you could be called correct, considering Obama inherited negative growth. > 90 trillion in stock market profitability, which of course translates into 401k accounts and adds to consumer confidence...which adds to spending.Yet wage growth remains stagnant. Trump has a long and well documented history of being a morally and ethically bankrupt huckster. I have yet to see any evidence of good character from him."

Between Kim and SK president being skeptical of the US, I can only imagine that something will happen that will cause some sort of divide somewhere. Like NK pitting SK against the US. Or, you know, the start of WWIII...worst case scenario. This would be great if t played out the way we all hope it should. It wouldn't sound this good without something really bad attached"

He knows the meeting will never occur, but he's saying it will, so then he can blame whoever he feels appropriate for the meeting 'not occurring.'2) I'm happy we're now agreeing that it's a good thing to have dialogue with rogue dictators - I just find it odd that so many Republicans who said our president should never sit down with Ahmadinejad are supporting this. I guess, to them, we do negotiate with terrorists, but only when it's their guy in office?3) Kim has killed dozens in his family and thousands or millions in his country. I have a feeling Trump admires his strong man qualities, and I have a feeling Trump will be giving Kim compliments at various steps along the way, and that will be **horrifying**."

dvfejs0,majinace,North Korea is pretty predictable. They will delay or cancel this meeting unless it happens inside North Korea. The whole reason they agreed to this show is to get heat off thier backs while they continue to develop thier nuclear program.

An end to the war will be signed, all US troops will have to leave SK, and we'll have to provide a big stipend of food and money to NK permanently. Basically having to prop the regime up forever. In return they will have to destroy everything and have our inspectors in there 24/7 indefinitely. Any screw up and the allowances stop and the troops come back.

dvfjayp,Merpedy,"A) Why is Trump allowed to be involved in all of this? Imo this should first be solved between the two Koreas before the world being able to jump in and potentially fuck it up. B) There is no way Korea is going to throw away their nukes unless the “royal” family is allowed to slip into the background or remain of high status like nothing had happened (there is no way the regime, or at least Kim and his family would want to be tried for their crimes) C) I haven't thought this far but I sure hope Trump doesn't mess this up"

dvg8x2q,djm19,"If he goes to the meeting and get some form of positive concession I will be more than willing to give him credit for that. Does not even have to be as good as inspectors. A simple statement from the NK with even a somewhat positive tone would make it a journey well spent. IMO, thats more than reasonable because many people who actually study this issue would say anything short of freeing political prisoners or a concrete concession would make it a victory for Kim and a loss of a powerful device for the US.I just expect American citizens to not fall for some delusion that Kim feels threatened by Trump rhetoric. Thats not what is happening here and the SK government knows how to appease Trump's desires."

dvf27hf,funnyinfoguy,"What I can see happening is, North Korea finally bends the knee in a peaceful manor. Kim would hold a negotiation similar to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. Where Hirohito relinquished all of his power and the ultimate surrender of imperial japan, in turn for his life being spared, because he is the god of his Japanese people. These indications alone are recreated and fabricated in North Korean culture unlike popular belief throughout the world besides North Korea, people do see Kim as a God. If we are not able guarantee his safety with a democratic transition in place there would be uncivil blood shed in the name of Kim's families legacy if he were to die. Or a modern day Korea with Kim's family under protection of prosecution. Although I believe this would be the greatest route for Korea to become unified, Kim will walk, but sometimes evil needs to win in this cruel world. As for my Uncle who had served and obtained a bronze star in 1954 for his service in the Korean War “Korea was a motherfucker, those Kim's will get what they deserve for what we went through”.Till this day at 85, he hasn't told me a single story of what happened on the battlefield, but only the good times he had with his company and troubles with his cos."

There would be a limit to how far that can go. That foreign leader doesn't want to destroy you, just continue to exploit you for all you're worth. So he has to throw you a bone now and then.... in this case talks with a hermit kingdom led by a loony who nonetheless is under the thumb of the foreign leader who recorded your pee video.It's no skin off this guy's back if you get better relations with a dirt poor hermit kingdom led by a loony who has incarcerated many of his citizens and left many of the others to eat grass for nourishment.

In fact, why in the world would they give up their nukes now, when their nukes are getting them a private meeting with the president of the United States.

dvf9siq,nachomancandycabbage,"*from some ""deep state"" intelligence members, that they ""leak"" everything that happens at the meeting,*Ahh yes, putting deep state in quotes makes your forecast infinitely more rational. The whole deep state conspiracy nonsense has gotten insane, when there are probably a number of very simple explanations for why things get leaked. The White House has the turn over of a McDonald's restaurant, how the hell would one expect to fine and keep trust worthy people when they are constantly getting canned? Or when Trump himself is leaking things out ala the submarines deployed to North Korean waters he leaked or the intelligence he leaked to the Russians in the fucking White House. How would one expect to keep things secret, when the boss himself can't keep his mouth shut.So the idea that a massive FBI and CIA conspiracy is behind all of the problems, most notably the leaks, at the White House is fucking crazy."
dvf9aia,The3Percenterz,All of you speak abt Russia and the election with banal talking points. None of it has proven true or Trump would be out by now. Stfu so sick of untrue shit being said.

dvgrwlz,Ed98208,Huh? That doesn't even make sense. They won't impeach him because of partisanship.

dvgs8vu,Ed98208,"They're starting to hate him, especially with the tariffs and North Korea situation. But they know the optics of impeaching a president from their own party would be like suicide.
