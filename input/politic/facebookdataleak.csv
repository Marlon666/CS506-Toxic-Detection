dvyto55,throwaway_ghast,Allow me to play the world's smallest violin.
dvzb9n4,agoodfriendofyours,I have lost 7% of my net worth in a single day at least once a month for most of my life.
dvzbtyq,Electric_Evil,Only once a month? Those are rookie numbers!
dvzdrnj,notmrcollins,All I need to do is go get a haircut and I've lost 7% of my net worth.
dvzdzf8,tonufan,At least you have positive net worth. Rip student loans.
dvze1za,reflux212,Ah you are on the American economy programme
dvze36i,tonufan,I'm living on the American Dream™.
dvzg7qy,Swesteel,I'm sure you'll be a millionare any day now.

dvzprkb,Yaboydev,Great band name
dvzr0jd,Zomby2D,"I've been doing that for years. On the rare occasions that I buy a lottery ticket, I wait for weeks before checking the number.I love the term Schrodinger's Millionaire, might start using it."
dvzrfd5,SaltyEmotions,"Or until your neighbor tells you, ""Hey look Jherad! I got the winning ticket!"""
dvzt582,Aldrai,Hey it's me your schrodinger's cousin.
dvzymci,Tylertooo,Is that the American adaptation of Slumdog Millionaire? I really wish we would stop doing that.
dvzpufc,MisterLoox,You only make money in time to die so you can pay the taxes on it.

dvznfa8,AvatarIII,"anyone with a mortgage has a negative net worth, right? or are properties counted as assets towards net worth?"
dw08iiu,tonufan,If you owe more on a mortgage than the house is worth than it is negative net worth.
dvzlgh5,LetsGoBlackhawks2014,Ain't that the truth
dvzryrd,Sneak_Stealth,"Join the club. I had to schedule only one class this semester because of class time offerings, and my full time job. The government has decided that one class isnt enough for my loans to stay approved, so now I'm paying my loans off, while still enrolled. I have to get another loan for the fall semester in august no less, lmao."
dw0nhuw,dj3hac,"At least you'll end up with a job that pays more than $11, maybe."
dw0o025,tonufan,But the minimum wage in my state is $11.50...working retail at Walmart starts a dime above minimum.
dw0qquk,dj3hac,"Minimum wage is 10.70 here, and that's *Canadian* dollars."

dvzfiw8,Silent-G,That's only because you had your hair appraised by your own mother.
dvzfu9z,intredasted,"Rent day, huh."
dvzkowc,crooks4hire,I hope you have that hair insured.
dvzl0s1,Vonderbeeks,I went to the quick store and filled up with gas and grabbed a cup of coffee.... 4% of my net worth vanished.
dvzl4ik,ExpensiveTip,"shit man, I could do that by buying a sandwich. not even a nice one"
dvznb6m,conansucksdick,Grow it out.
dvzq5mr,bubblanasty,Wow. Suddenly I feel less depressed. Thanks man!
dvzgse7,JonnyRichter,Losing money and spending it on making yourself more attractive aren't the same thing.
dvzn8qp,paintball6818,Yea because you spent all your other money on avocado toast! /s
dvzp5q9,notmrcollins,Us darned millennials!
dvzibc5,BBA935,"It happens to me when I poo from what I've been told. I'm in negative territory, guys. :("
dvzqrro,JoeDidcot,Your wealth is invested in your hair? That's pretty odd.
dvztyc9,notmrcollins,It's a joke.
dw01y7i,JoeDidcot,"So was my comment. Your statement implied that the cost of your haircut was 7% of your net wealth. I meant to ironically assume that the hair itself was somehow intriniscally worth 7% of your net wealth. Like a financial Samson or something. The ole reddit misunderstandaroo, some might say. It worked better in my head."
dvzcvlo,Handy_Dude,I see /r/Wallstreetbets is leaking...

dvzebr9,Handy_Dude,Lol they've been jerkin off in a corner using their tears as lube this last two weeks.
dvzfl69,letsgomurphys,2 weeks? more like the last 6
dvzogxk,Sonyw810,This girl asked what I'm into I told her I like it rough. She asked “like choking and stuff” I said no. I need you to show me my cryptocurrency portfolio.

dvzqtvl,JoeDidcot,How are their wives holding up?
dw0ek0g,Sonyw810,She's banging some investment broker upstate. She said she wanted more stability. Said I don't even have my series 7 license. Told her if she can't handle these 800% losses she doesn't deserve the 35% gains.
dvzg6w0,catsupbot,"Yeah if they're just sitting with their hands in their pockets and don't know how to trade well, maybe."

dvzrxba,KatyPerrysBootyWhole,The only time I've been to that sub was when some trust fund kid had lost so much of his inheritance that he decided to use the last of it to short apple because he thought they were gonna have a record low quarter and they didn't and he lost like a million dollars or something obscene. Is that all that sub is?
dw095z5,Handy_Dude,"I remember that. And yes, Wallstreetbets is the ""anarchy"" of stock trading."
dvzepur,Hellkin,Everyday bitches!
dvzqq93,BulletBilll,Real men put 3 extra mortgages on their home and put it all into cryptocurrency early last January.
dvzrsbk,CalebDK,My net wealth jumps every 2 weeks but then levels out couple hours later.
dvzfcew,Cobek,"I think they mean like 23 out of 27 years it was the most, as in many days a month, and now It's maybe one."
dvzh5wv,jahs_126,So you're a fan of r/cryptocurrency too..
dvzhaxw,Electric_Evil,"Nah, I just really liked that scene from The Wolf of Wall Street."
dvzqmt9,allowableearth,Gotta get those numbers up
dvzbugm,SavageIndustries,Shit you guys got a positive net worth?

dvzcbls,RocketPowerHandshake,"It's when you have a bunch of nets and all your neighbors get really envious of you. It can be fishing nets, butterfly nets, basketball nets, or even a combination of them all if you're really doing good."
dvzco78,Agnoman,I sold my nets years ago to buy lentils :(
dvzct78,twodogsfighting,Look at fatcat over here boasting about his lentils.
dvzd0ta,Simmo5150,Probably calls his car hole a *garage*.

dvztjdr,Theshaggz,I don't care what he calls his car hole. He's got a car!
dvzcrkv,clivesdalek,I need to diversify my nets.
dvztgcm,Em_Adespoton,To go with one of the first comments in the thread... hair nets.
dvzdnm2,PigSlam,I don't even own a net.
dvzgyyf,fighterace00,My net's full of holes :(
dvzpiiz,Cyberspark939,It's the minimum number of nets required such that you can make a physically programmable system capable of replacing you.
dvzc9st,listgrotto,Apparantly having a net worth is a thing. Did not get that memo.

dvzczqc,TWeaKoR,"He only lost 2.2% at the close of the day. The dip in stocks is the lowest point, but is actually only important to people doing short term trading (I imagine someone made a killing on this)."
dvzjd2z,vilent_sibrate,Didn't he donate 99% of his fb shares in 2015 anyways?

dvzhqd0,GregoryGoose,"Well I didn't know we were counting belongings. It doesn't change things significantly, but it is comforting to know my toaster is owned outright."

dvzm2ln,danhakimi,I've lost almost half my net worth since graduating law school. I'm hoping to get up to zero by 2020.

dvzffe3,strongbadfreak,7% of my networth that I could lose 90% of and still have more money than I could ever spend in my entire life.
dvzgi98,link5057,7%? I lose 50% once a month
dvzh619,altiuscitiusfortius,Yeah. I also lost a twenty dollar bill today. Same thing. But no headlines for me.

dvznlyn,monkeyofdoom4324,Same I went to McDonald's and bang down 7%
dvzpl2w,AssHaberdasher,I lose 50% of my net worth every other Friday.
dvzrlbh,dichloroethane,Rent was due?
dvztf6x,papagert,7%?? damn. i lose nearly 90% everytime i pay
dvzvoge,modder9,7% is nothing once you start getting into cryptocurrency. It's +/-30% everyday. Would recommend if you like overwhelming joy and deep depression on a daily basis.
dw0o1oy,neomech,You haven't lost anything until you sell.
dw0qao7,Acidyo,In crypto that can happen daily.
dvz87a8,vinegarfingers,And allow him to laugh along. Mark doesn't care about $5B at this point. It's so odd to me to see the direction that he's allowed Facebook to take when he really has no meaningful monetary gain at this point. He's rich well beyond anyone's wildest dreams and Facebook's success or failure won't impact that very much. I wonder what motivated him to jeopardize the platform that got him where he is.
dvzewm7,VyRe40,"Have you read the crazy political manifesto he made about how no one should have privacy anymore? Among other things, the dude thinks the world is going in a certain direction and that he has a hand in it. That's where his baby, Facebook, comes in. In some ways, he might be right, but I'd rather not live in his cyberpunk social media fantasy."
dvzjnyn,gameShark428,Ironic that he doesn't believe in privacy but people get banned when they share the picture of him at a rave on some drug; probably molly.[I think this is the one](https://i.imgur.com/Tc7OYFf.jpg).
dvzl9ne,GorillaThoughts,Lmfao I was wondering where the cropped version of that image came from. Too good.
dvzryes,BreathManuallyNow,If I post this on FB they'll ban my account? Worth it.
dvzuk1r,PussyWagon6969,Right?! Just finally figured out how to delete my account for good!

dw06nnz,HoodieGalore,Holy shit his eyes look like he's got Harlequin ichthyosis. Thoughts and prayers!
dvzwlqx,arhythm,Thanks. Gonna share that some more.
dvzi6kj,Betasheets,"You put it that way, he sounds like a end of episode villain in a superhero cartoon who transforms into some kind of robot because ""he has become social media"""
dvzllp9,whatarestairs,The more you read about him the more he sounds like a villan!
dvzjbfz,George_E_Hale,"It's like that shitty movie *The Circle* that appeared to have the angle of a cautionary tale then just ended like, Nah, it's cool."
dvzo8r9,SarahC,"The one where people vote on who they want to die next, they get zapped and dragged off by a force field?"
dvzuuoo,SoggyFrenchFry,"Lol, no The Circle has Hermoine and Forrest Gump in it and is about a tech company / social media thing that is permeating into everything.The one you're thinking of is just called Circle. Big difference, ha. I saw it on Netflix and it was pretty bad, but OK for a parody viewing."
dw18zg2,SarahC,Ahhhh!I quite enjoyed it.... damn.
dvzvcb2,Eckomute,"[You're thinking of Black Mirror](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3118452/)Edit: Looks like SoggyFrenchFry remembered the movie after all and edited their comment, making this comment useless."
dvzpv3i,gizmoglitch,"We're talking about *Survivor*, right?"
dw191gm,SarahC,"No ""Circle"" I quite liked it!Kinda single location film."
dvzo9xa,nekoshinigami,The book was amazing. The movie is shit. Read the book. It's so much better.
dvzpyqq,George_E_Hale,Glad to hear. I kept staring at Emma Watson trying to will the film to be good. I failed.
dvztk3h,nekoshinigami,I read the book first and watched the movie after. Wow. I was like... why the fuck would you ruin a good book by adapting the movie into something shitty like that?
dvzk5yu,jackpaintsthestreets,"This sounds less like he created facebook to mesh with his pre-existing ideology, and more like he created an ideology that made him the world's hero to justify his billions of dollars.I'm rich, therefore I must be a superior person ushering in a new era of humanity. Mark Zuckerberg has just discovered Republicanism."
dvznb4l,13speed,"> I'm rich, therefore I must be a superior person ushering in a new era of humanity. Mark Zuckerberg has just discovered Republicanism.George Soros said he was some type of god.The ultra-rich are also ultra fucked in the head, doesn't matter where on the political spectrum they fall."
dvzqbib,JagerBaBomb,"When you think about the decisions these people had to make to get where they are, it makes sense that there'd be at least *some* propensity toward megalomaniacal tendencies."
dvzrqgg,13speed,"Crushing all in their path, lives, corporations, entire nations.We're supposed to look up to these people, and many of them are sociopaths."
dvzr5hx,BadJuJu2,"I would tend to use the phrase “stolen facebook” instead of “created Facebook”.Your statement is dead on, though!"
dvzitys,leo-skY,"That's what happens when sociopathis asocial weirdos luck out and become multibillionaires, with no regulations or consequences for the disasters they introduce into the world"
dvzibks,Qixotic,Cyberpunk would be the very opposite of a no-privacy Orwellian world. Most of the heroes in cyberpunk are criminals hiding shady things.
dvztou8,VyRe40,"The very nature of cyberpunk is dystopian corporate states, where you have to be a criminal to live a private, independent life while the masses just settle to live in relative suffering."
dw0brwd,Roast_A_Botch,"That's because cyberpunk tells the stories of people left behind in Utopian futures. It assumes there is no ""perfect future"", but the haves will find better ways to ignore the have-nots. Of course people will always find a way around restrictions, but just as with Facebook, the majority accept it with no resistance. Just because Gibson(or anyone else) told the stories of those who resisted, doesn't mean they're the norm. Nobody wants to read about the lames who obey and live out boring lives. It's why Snowden is the only NSA workers name i know."
dvzmmzf,bargu,"> Have you read the crazy political manifesto he made about how no one should have privacy anymore?Says the guy who brought a private island for himself... So, you know, I don't believe him very much."
dvzn4ud,kickingpplisfun,"Ugh, says the fucker who walled off a private beach after he forced the owners off of it... Seriously, these guys never air out their dirty laundry even though they're all too happy to see others' secrets."
dvzlwhx,vampirewknd,"Its as if he read 1984 and A Brave New World and said ""I want to do that""."
dw03nqo,Edheldui,> I'd rather not live in his cyberpunk social media fantasy.It might be a little too late for that.
dvzlwp6,imdungrowinup,And we all thought Elon Musk was the one.
dvzcmwc,MostNatutalBandit,"I think the problem is companies are expected to report impressive growth figures so they become increasingly unscrupulous as they try to squeeze out any growth they can. Facebook is still incredibly successful, although the recent wave of badwill may see another competitor swoop in causing its market share to shrink like Microsoft in the near future. They're on even shakier ground because they don't sell a physical product so they have to maintain market share by buying out competitors."
dvzehsn,646f672069726c,"But if you have *a billion dollars* what's the point of earning more? With a *million* dollars I could eat at Red Lobster every week for the rest of my life. At a certain point, what's the incentive to squeeze out more growth?"
dvzgjws,TheMarlBroMan,You can be held criminally liable by your shareholders. You have a fiduciary responsibility to do your best to see growth.
dvzgpfx,646f672069726c,Oops that's pretty good incentive. But why does the law support that?
dvzgu4e,TheMarlBroMan,Shareholders give money to a company under the explicit idea that you will do your best to make them money on their investment. This is a good thing.
dvzw8zy,DEFINITION_PLEASE,"Mmm. No, it's not necessarily a good thing, especially when it drives companies towards unethical or immoral behavior in search of financial gains... when the shareholders have received well more than enough money as it is.To a certain extent, it's a great idea for growing a business. After a point, the net welfare gain is seriously skewed away from society as a whole."
dvzx9xw,TheMarlBroMan,You don't get to decide what is “more than enough money” You have no right to that money only. You are evil.
dw03cf9,DEFINITION_PLEASE,"Interesting.So you would say that if, say, a company botches or suppresses research showing that their product or business is harmful to society as a whole for the sake of turning a profit, that is okay...But I'm evil for saying otherwise?"
dvzr5nl,enduhroo,"Bc without that law, shitty people will scam investors"
dvzoyq2,AntiKamniaChemicalCo,because capitalism
dw0c7y8,Roast_A_Botch,"That duty doesn't mean profit and growth above everything else. It means they're legally responsible to their shareholders if they make stupid decisions with their money. Causing the share price to tank 20% by being careless, or complicit, isn't very responsible either.Otherwise Amazon would be in prison for investing all their profits into R&D."
dvzslzu,LorenzoLighthammer,but with a billion you can eat red lobster off of jessica alba
dvzkot4,Musaks,well if eating at red lobster everyday is your spending-ceiling it will be hard for you to imagine...but there is so much more you can do if spending a few millions on something random doesn't change your portfolio at all
dvzssj3,Kriegenstein,"> With a million dollars I could eat at Red Lobster every week for the rest of my life.Good news, you don't need a million to do that."

dvze6lg,vezokpiraka,"Social media is burnt out. In order for a technology to be succesful, you need to get the younger people interested in it.

dvzery9,Dagon,">The only people who use Facebook are 40-50 year old who post random bullshit. That's verifiably false. >In less than 3 years Facebook will be a husk.

dvzf1ki,AssPennies,I've read (some) insurance companies already hook into fb to decide coverage/premium decisions.
dvzfu4h,-FeistyRabbitSauce-,Jesus Christ.
dvzkgpw,choomguy,A wha?
dvzer8f,comfypepe,You really underestimate Facebook. Twitter is only really a thing in the US/UK. I'm from Northern Europe and not a single person I know use Twitter but everybody is on Facebook. Many dont update it but there are a ton of useful communities and tools allowing you to create events and letting people know about them.
dvzibv6,Strazdas1,"Im from eastern europe and instagram, snapchat and other mobile-oriented networks are eating facebook up here. Twitter is not as popular, but the others are."
dvzlabq,comfypepe,Yeah facebook in terms of people using it fot communication/posts isnt nearly as popular anymore. But its pretty hard to replace completely as everyone has their social network set up there & for instance every student in Finland uses it to keep up to date with incoming parties and school events. Its going to be hard for other platforms to replace that aspect of FB.
dvzjonm,nixiedust,"> The only people who use Facebook are 40-50 year old who post random bullshit.I know this is a common belief, and younger people do seem to be dropping off, but it's not entirely true. [Here is a snapshot of FB demographics in Jan 2018, showing that the largest user group is still Millennials.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/187041/us-user-age-distribution-on-facebook/)"
dvzk5qo,vezokpiraka,All my friends use facebook for college and for subscribing to some sort of funny pages. They are not using it in the way they did it before by poating videos and pictures.
dvzkra7,nixiedust,"Yes, and, of course,all your friends absolutely reflect the behavior of the rest of the world, right?Aside from being anecdotal evidence, this assumes Facebook cares how you use it. In reality, once you are logged in it tracks what you are doing (on and off the platform) and productizes your behavioral information. Your friends are still using Facebook and Facebook is still benefiting. Facebook doesn't care if you post videos and pictures because the product is your online actions. That's all they want."
dvzkfzi,choomguy,"Facebook owns a lot of shit. I'm sure they've considered the possibility that it implodes, and have plenty of strategies. No shit, if nothing else, they will sell your privacy back to you."
dvzmts2,BriefIntelligence,Facebook owns Instagram. Instagram doesn't seem to be losing any popularity at all over the years. Snapchat and Twitter aren't as popular.
dvzia92,Strazdas1,I dont agree its going to die as quick as 3 years (this is not myspace) but it will. We already see the mobile social media taking over.
dvzk9qt,SomeGuyNamedJames,Which is being lead by FB anyway.
dw1fzzl,Strazdas1,Not so much lead as FB is buying up all successful startups :P
dw1ghnn,SomeGuyNamedJames,"Well yeah they're leading via muscle, but still leading. :P"
dvzsmz5,Dire87,"Jesus, in what world do you live in? You're just spreading lies. And what if Facebook will be a husk in 3 years? Doesn't really matter. For the past 20 years some new social media stuff has just replaced a previous leviathan. It all started rather locally and then went international. If FB fails, someone else will take their place.

dvzah2p,tgwhite,I'm not a Zuckerberg fan at all. I do have to point out that he's not insider trading. Execs at his level aren't allowed any semblance of control over the timing of their trades in their company stock. They have to put in sales plans (10b5-1) that specify a certain number of shares to be sold over a period of time by a broker or some other agent.

dvzh6qt,suclearnub,Wait. The US doesn't even have identity cards?
dvziim0,Dioxid3,"The part of why identity theft is an issue in the US is that, unlike most European countries, your I.D doesn't necessarily contain a picture of you."
dvzmk47,antillus,They use their drivers licenses as ID. Same as here in Canada.
dvzp43c,Chaotic_Crimson,"No, not really. We have a drivers license (they do issue alternatives if you have never been able to drive or no longer can), SSNs and military I.D.The former is used mostly for buying things with age limits aswell as some paperwork (obviously vehicle related things) and functions as the closest thing you'll get to an actually identity card with SSNs being used for banking/job applications/official paperwork etc."
dvzviw1,kcgdot,"We absolutely do, it's just that most people don't go through the process to get one, until we start driver training, and then you get your learner permit, and then your license, which in most states qualifies as picture identification.But that leaves most young people without an ID for 15+ years"
dvzxm1m,suclearnub,...but that's a driver's license.
dvzzmt5,kcgdot,"And in most states, it also qualifies as identification.That's the problem. There's no incentive, unless you're going to apply for a passport before then, there's no big push to get I'd.Most parents/kids accept their school issued ID as good enough"

dvzjfdc,TwiZtah,"In Sweden, most of the things you would need to sign something can be signed using BankID. Want to buy something on the internet? Log in using BankID, want to access your journals? Log in with BankID. You can set this up so no matter what business tries to access your account, you would need to sign it using BankID. Like if a scammer got a hold of your card number, they can't use that anyway to get any money from you unless you accept it.It is tied to you and only you and you log in with the app on your phone with a password. It is amazing."
dvzp6bt,Chaotic_Crimson,God damn coveted Swedish banks and their functioning scam prevention.

dvzc30t,warfrogs,"[They can be used as personal IDs, are far more secure, and segments government and private use.](http://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-were-developing-blockchain-id-system-starting-with-our-authenticator-app/)Edit: [Better article.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-09/want-to-ditch-social-security-numbers-try-blockchain)"
dvzjhrb,DaveDashFTW,"Blockchain is basically just a distributed ledger protocol, it doesn't actually solve the issue at hand.With blockchain you'd still need a way to identify yourself to gain access. The main difference is you keep the key and it's not stored in a centralised database, but that's basically any cryptographic technology. Everyone could store their information encrypted in a database and it would be the same thing.If you read the articles it's actually a combination of biometric authentication and encryption that solves the SSN issue - not blockchain. Blockchain just makes it so it's (much) harder to tamper with. Also if you ever lost your private keys - good luck. TLDR: Blockchain prevents tampering. It's not an authentication or cryptography platform itself."
dvzieg8,Strazdas1,"They wouldnt, but lets throw some buzzwords around and pretend that the problem is solved."
dvzcjii,Red5point1,"Your data would not be acquired, stored or secured by any single group, company or individual."
dvzd4qm,SodaAnt,But that doesn't explain how block chain would actually securely store the data in an accessible way.
dvzdlsc,Red5point1,"Essentially each person is given a key to open a ""safety box"" in the network. So long as you are the only one who has access to that key then you are the only one who can control the contents of that safety box. There are no admins, staff, caretakers who need or have access to it. Security, maintenance and storage is all self managed by the network."
dvzebd6,jsalsman,"No amount of blockchain pixie dust will keep banks, insurance companies, marketers, financial and campaign services companies and the like from keeping the information privately no matter how secure it is before you have to give it to them to apply for their products."
dvzevu5,Red5point1,"When the internet was first hitting the public, the same thing people said about their mail. ""I have paper and a pen, why would I need a computer to send a letter to someone, the postal office will not trust computers to handle their mail"" The point is, sure a lot of blockchain hype is pie in the sky specially the price per coins, that is a bubble and people who think ""they are investing"" are going to end up in tears. However, the underlying technology is solid and it will not rely on banks, insurance companies et al. Infact it will replace such organizations. How many times have you seen news about some ""intern"" breaking the law and either publishing private into by accident or getting paid to do so. With blockchain that can not happen."
dvzhd3q,jsalsman,"It doesn't matter whether your private information was in a blockchain or a sealed envelope. Once you've given it to someone else, they have it, and their interns can absolutely publish it."
dvzij2s,Red5point1,the blockchain is not someone else though. no one controls it or owns it.
dvzyaua,jsalsman,"So? It doesn't protect you from other people doing whatever they want with the information in it, including storing and sharing, as soon as you've shown it to them."
dvzgrod,jnofx,"So if I lose my password or physical key, then what? With no staff or anything, there's no convenient “forgot password?” Button, right? So do we just no longer get to participate with society, or what?"
dvziac6,going_for_a_wank,That is why you must read the simple 94 page security guide. Personally I am partial to the birdbath storage method.
dvzilmp,Red5point1,"well that is where you would decide to either trust some entity to ""guard"" your data or you take responsibility to look after your own data. at least you will have an option."
dvzjk7x,jnofx,"Ok, people aren't ready for that responsibility. They keep opting to give their data to Facebook or whoever else wants it. So personal responsibility is clearly out. So, now someone guards our data. Just like in Communism, the people there maintain checks-and-balances are a contradiction of themselves and the system simply by existing. Am I interpreting the future wrong?"
dvzfqu4,Tasgall,"Great idea - what should we make this key? Oh, how about a 9 digit hash number, we can separate it into chunks of 3, 2, and 4 to make it easier to remember. Maybe send everyone a little card to make sure the don't forget? (just use paper though, don't need to make it fancy or at all durable)I get the buzzword hype and all, but putting this in a public ledger isn't a benefit in the slightest. If you lose your number or get it stolen, there's no central authority who can get it back for you or fix anything that was tampered with. Plus, if I didn't make it clear already, it doesn't even solve the problem of having to remember a number."
dvzgjfj,Red5point1,no one is forcing you do use it. if you don't like the idea or concept fine don't use it.
dw1c6do,Tasgall,"...I mean, we're talking about a digital national ID system here. It is literally something everyone would be forced to use."

dvztazh,phormix,"Honestly, if you removed SSN from the chain do you really think it would make a significant difference?These companies still have massive amounts of other information, like all your CC #'s, and history of your home addresses, employers, phone #'s, and jobs etc."
dvzwgdf,warfrogs,"It would be a significant step in the right direction for separating governmental identity and private identity. I worked in banking for a number of years, and the use of SSNs as identifying markers has a host of problems associated with it. Whether it's because of people having their SSN changed, or simply backend issues that are associated with the system in and of itself, moving away from using them as identifying markers would be a huge improvement."
dvzcg6z,Flash604,"> IIRC, they had enough time that their sell orders could be processed before they broke the newsThe Facebook breach was quite some time ago. They had to know it was going to come out eventually."
dvzcm94,warfrogs,"Not necessarily. A long series of events had to occur for the info to get out. Cambridge Analytics had to get pinged, their impropriety had to be noted, and then it had to get back that Facebook was aware of the issue and did not inform its users.There was a decent chance that the information would just get missed as more and more data got dumped during the investigation, and they may have assumed that even if it did get back to them, they could have deflected the damage.So, in order for all this to fall into place, the investigation had to start, it had to go into Cambridge Analytics, it had to discover the purchased information, recognize that it violated numerous privacy safeguard, and then THAT information had to get out to the public at large AND be noticed by people. With the amount of data that's been pouring out, it could have been missed, or assumed to be normal data gathering. A lot of things went wrong (for them, right for us) in order for this to come to light.Calculated risk, but it paid off poorly for them."
dvzidzf,Strazdas1,"Or you know just do what literally entire rest of the world does and use unique ID numbers assigned to people from birth that has nothing to do with your SSN. But that would require people in US to actually get IDs, and apperently that is somehow contentiuos issue there."
dvzcnp2,Red5point1,Equifax execs knew long ahead of time before the public or anyone outside found out. Which gave them time to off-load their shares without attracting attention at the time.
dvzco8s,couldbutwont,It's lame you've got to make it clear you're not a fan before stating a simple fact.
dvzcs45,tgwhite,"Yeah I feel like I'd be dismissed outright as a shill. But even before this news, I truly didn't like the guy that much, especially after his prepping for running for higher office. So I don't mind putting that qualifier out there."
dvzs24f,couldbutwont,I believe it. Just find it frustrating!
dvzjksn,Litico,"I do think your post misses a big point however. Of course an exec doesn't illegally trade by buying/selling their own shares, that'd be mad. They coordinate with other like-minded pals to move their stock and essentially grab a finders fee. It's a win-win, player 1 beats the market and player 2 profits directly. P.S. This is the most utterly simple example"
dvzq7bu,notjfd,"At the same time, Zuckerberg has known about this for a long time, so there was plenty of time for him to divest."
dvztji4,tgwhite,"Yeah I was just thinking about that, that's a good point."
dvzfwxc,AssPennies,"Serious question: Once a sales plan like this has been arranged, is there any turning back, or is Zuckerberg on the hook with the prearranged amount being sold in a downturn like this? Also, does the broker have the latitude within that given period of *when* to actually make the sale, does Zuckerberg have any say in it?"
dvzub44,tgwhite,"Looks like a broker does have some latitude. So it's possible Zuck set up a plan with MNPI (see below for definition) or that his broker timed some sales with MNPI. I can't say more because I don't know his sales plan. ""For the insider to enter into this plan, he must not have any access to the MNPI regarding anything about the company as well the company's securities. The plan must follow three distinct criteria to be valid:1. The price and amount must be specified (this may include a set price) and certain dates of the sales or purchases must be noted.2. Metrics behind the method of buying or the sales method must be qualified, determining the math behind determining the price and date.3. The plan must allow the broker the right to determine when to make the sale or purchase as long as the broker does so without any MNPI to coincide with insider trading laws.""Read more: Rule 10b5-1 https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule-10b5-1.asp#ixzz5AIehZEgx Follow us: Investopedia on Facebook"

dvzb0nw,lotsofsyrup,do you think maybe some major US event was happening in september that facebook had something to do with?
dvzbbbn,Hxcfrog090,"I don't quite know if you're referring to something specific, but even if that was the case it wouldn't really make a difference. At least to my understanding, it doesn't quite matter what is going on in the company because CEOs use a broker that they tell to sell off a certain amount of stocks over “x” amount of time. And it's made public. Insider trading is making stock movements based on information that isn't public knowledge."
dvzdg0f,FeelsGoodMan2,"I mean i'm no expert but isnt it conceivable that a guy says to himself 'I'm doing some seriously shady shit, i should offload some of this just in case this shit hits the fan because if this gets out it'll tank.'?Now, i dont personally think thats insider trading, but thats also not just innocent selling of stock. But, i guess with laws like this, it's black and white when it comes down to it."
dvzbrvv,lotsofsyrup,the fact that he has to use a middleman and tell people he's trading stock doesn't mean he would tell everyone why he's trading the stock.
dvzdgu8,FishDawgX,"You have to schedule the stock trades months in advanced. Even years in advanced. And slowly over time. The whole idea is to prevent any possibility that they are timing their trades based on non-public information (which, of course, they have)."

dvzd496,Teantis,"> He just cares about money and it shows.As does every business man but what gets me about the tech companies is they were such blind believers in the transformative social power of their creations and so blindly arrogant to political problems and dynamics because they just dismissed dysfunctional problems of politics as ""just ignorant/stupid people or whatever"" and had so much faith in their intellectual superiority that they never even gave it even a serious thought until it whacked all of us. They thought they were above that shit. Well welcome to the shit assholes.At least when other businesses create or cause evil its because it made sense for them on a selfish level. Causing it because you're so convinced of your righteousness and too arrogant to listen and then reacting by basically just sitting there dumbfounded grinds my gears."
dvzk73i,theivoryserf,This is what I think about when I see STEM graduates rubbishing the humanities. We're in an age where technical know-how is valued much more than developed empathy or social wisdom.
dvzk6zh,cockmongler,No-one at Facebook ever thought they were doing something for the public good. Zuckerberg has very publicly mocked Facebook users for trusting him with their personal details.
dvzlcm9,Teantis,"Not expecting them to do stuff for the public good. Basically I'm asking two grades of things: a) not contribute to bad shit or, failing that, b) have some damn intentionality when you're going to do bad shit. Not just bumble into it due to being amoral and willfully oblivious.Also I don't agree I think quite a few people in tech companies drink the Kool aid and start believing their own hype about how Good their product is. Merely because rationalizing shit is basic human nature."

dvzdrjt,Hyperdrunk,"I might be naive, but I honestly think Elon Musk sees money as a means to do cool and interesting shit rather than wanting power.Like a modern Nikola Tesla."
dvzdzkz,Teantis,"I don't think Elon's test has come yet. So we'll see if he applies as much thought, care, and study into ideas of governance resulting from his creations (like SpaceX and neural nets, Tesla not so much) as others. The fact that he's at least already thinking of ideas of what governing Mars would look like (even if I think they're fuzzy and a little naive atm) and that he's talking about AI and marking out its pros and cons for humanity is at least promising.Facebooks ideas basically consisted ofWe're gonna connect everybody (yeah!) Then the people will have the information(yeah!) Then we're gonna sell manipulative technology to incipient dictators like Duterte without examining whether this is the right thing to do and just assume fragile democracies work just fine and wash our hands of it! (.... yeah?)"
dvzfy3j,athey,"Elon Musk co-founded Zip2 in ‘95, (it was a web software company building the backend infrastructure to things like newspaper websites or something). That was sold to Compaq for $340 million in ‘99. Then he founded x.com, an online banking backbone that merged with continuity and became PayPal. That was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 Billion. At that point, according to an interview I saw, Musk asked himself what one crazy thing he would most want to do with his now enormous pile of money, before dying, and that was go to Mars. He started doing research and realized that rocket tech has practically been stalled since the 70's, and everyone just buys old rockets from Russia. He thought that was pathetic and he could do better, for less. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this... I just think it's kind of amazing. He did the traditional internet tech wiz shit with web infrastructure and software. He sold for a HUGE profit and then decided to take that pile of money and do the crazy amazing dream shit many geeks dream about but absolutely dismiss as impossible. Revolutionizing electric cars, renewable energy, and making space travel an actual real thing that can happen beyond governments and underfunded NASA. Everyone else would dismiss these as fun dreams, but just dreams. He saw them and went for it. Bonus points for actually being a super brilliant, business savvy, and adaptive genius."
dvzg2wi,Teantis,"I mean, I'm an Elon fan boy myself. But he has not yet reached the point where we can definitively say yeah he thoughtfully looked at the widespread impact on society and challenging governance implications of one of his creations and did his level best to mitigate potential harm for them. Simply because none of his creations have had massive governance implications... Yet. If he succeeds they will, and then we'll get to see. When that happens then we can say. Until then it's just kinda hoping he's thinking about this stuff. I'm inclined to think he is and will be grounded, mature, and smart enough to handle it well, but we really don't know.Edit: as an aside I'm thinking of Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and Google as comparisons. For handling social implications of their work (3 negatives, Google seems unharmful for the most part). Hell even reddit (massively imperfectly but still) has grappled more and earlier with its social impact and how to handle that and what it's responsibilities are than any of those three companies.Amazon should probably be up there but I live in a developing country and Amazons impact on my life is pretty obscure (I'm sure not non existent but rather abstract and indirect so I don't have any thoughts on it)"
dvzikfx,Strazdas1,"Just a little correction:>Then he founded x.com, an online banking backbone that merged with continuity and became PayPal. That was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 Billion. X.com was not working out and was bought by continuity who then absorbed people working there, including Musk, which they put as project lead on early developement of PayPal. He was no longer working on PayPal by the time it was sold and Musk saw very little of those 1.5 billion.This is not to say that musk was poor. He had, if i remmeber correctly, something like 400 million net worth at that point. He did not use it to start Tesla though, instead he found investors to pour money into it.Zip2 was so far the only actually profitable company Musk has had. As far as space travel goes, most of SpaceX budget comes from US government, so its still government funded space travel, just with some money laundering possibilities because NASA was just too useful to fund. Gota love politics.I do think Musk is brilliant, but i think he has a lot of naive ideas and is too stubborn to accept when he is wrong (hyperloop for example)."

dw000u5,Hiisi,"I guess the sharp decline didn't start immediately after they were bought by Facebook in that case - I feel like the point where they changed the feed from chronological order to algorithm based was the turning point for me. I assumed this coincided with the acquisition, my bad."

dvzj5mq,ferrousoxides,What's different is the concerted push by media to make it an issue. People always confuse what the media is talking about with what the masses are talking about.
dvzdy56,Scarletfapper,It is known.
dvzh9gb,kaiise,"> I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.same feels , bro. andi have been not so up on media./intelligence news."
dvzftby,RichardEruption,"Yes but if people aren't spoon fed info they will not know about it. Plus, considering how much coverage it's gotten I wouldn't be surprised if there's an anti Facebook agenda."
dvzc30g,SodaAnt,"The problem is that execs know *lots* of things about the company. This includes everything from long term development plans (maybe they plan on releasing a new phone by 2020), or any number of possible risks from the company. If every single one of those things barred you from selling stock, no exec could ever sell stock. Since that's obviously silly, there's a balance that gets struck between allowing freedom to sell and preventing insider trading."
dvzd7l4,sprkng,"At a previous job my manager said he was only allowed to sell shares in the company at two fixed dates each year, because he had insider info available. Not sure if it's Swedish law or because of something else"
dvzdagg,SodaAnt,"Actually pretty similar to how it works in the US. Usually not fixed dates, but if you're an exec and selling stock, you have to plan it weeks or months ahead and can't modify the plan afterward."
dvzfb4n,nigirizushi,"Do they declare # of shares or total amount?Hypothetically, if Zuckerberg said months ago he would sell $12 billion worth of stocks, and FB is suddenly worth $24 billion, would he lose majority stake?Can insider insider trading happen?"
dvzgdcc,awesomesauce615,I'm almost certain it would have to volume as what happens if the proposed value is higher than what they are worth at the the time. also volume allows you to maintain the ownership percentage you want.
dvzhqt0,Tod_Vom_Himmel,"Yes insider-trading happens because they just speculate with these trades and if they don't get through whatever change they wanted that would change the stock prices in their favor they will simply cancel the trade before it happens that means they can set up all the trades they want in advance and simply cancel the ones that wouldn't work out in their favor before they happen and then nothing is insider trading and everything is good to goBasically they can just set up a theoretical deal to sell all of their stock once every quarter or whatever they decide like and then cancel it every single time unless s*** goes south and then they're like ""oh we just happened to go through with this pre-planned sale"""
dvzdht7,ThatZBear,I'm sure everyone follows that rule very strictly

dvzfp8o,RichardEruption,"How is the market going there? I'm curious, I'd assume that'd hurt it because then everyone just dumps their stocks all at once."
dvzzjlu,sprkng,I don't trade myself but I've never heard anyone complaining about it. Only affects managers etc. investing in their own company and I've never met anyone rich enough to be able to singlehandedly affect the stock
dvzdffy,zanidor,"Making the exec's decision to sell public knowledge well in advance of the sale itself should also ensure the exec's ultimate sale price reflects the market's knowledge of the exec's decision to sell. The market doesn't have perfect knowledge of why the exec is selling, but it's still a good middleground since it gives the market time to react before the sale actually happens."
dvzhqej,moooooseknuckle,"This. Even Martha Stewart want insider trading. She got hit for lying, I think it was."
dvzqo6b,DutchGargravarr,"> Since that's obviously silly,Why? I think it's pretty common here that Execs aren't allowed to sell stock until they retire from the company and an amount of time after that even."
dvzkljh,Grasshopper21,maybe they shouldnt be allowed to sell stock unless they cut all ties with three company and only a year after said point. wouldnt be the worst idea to guarantee accountability and strongly devalue stock as a profit investment
dvzcf59,adamsmith6413,"Pretty simple solution. Pass a law to make it to where stocks can't be sold by execs/current employees, only borrowed upon and make the individual borrowing personally liable for the default on the debt if the stock has lost value prior to paying off the borrowed debt. . For example, in this case, Zuckerberg decides to use shares as collateral to borrow money at $180/share from a trustee. His company does something stupid like today and the stock drops to $160/share. Suck is personally liable for $20/share PLUS interest on the debt. He wouldn't sell if he knew bullshit was happening. If they believed in their company, they should be willing to sign off on the risk of the price declining."
dvzcnty,lelarentaka,"Good job, you just killed silicon valley's entire startup culture. Or pretty much entrepreneurship in general."
dvzexgl,Azrael_Garou,Lol who has regulation ever killed?
dvzd6js,adamsmith6413,And we'd all be better off.
dvzdade,zanidor,"a) This is a very convoluted solution.b) It's a terrible idea across a lot of dimensions. It's a loan nobody should ever take out since stock fluctuates for reasons out of your control. Also who is fronting the money for an interest-free loan? Or is the exec / employee expected to pay interest for the privilege of accessing their equity in the company, even if the stock does well? Doesn't this whole scheme incentivize people to leave the company once they have stock so they can sell it in a sane way?Bottom line is you can't compensate someone with stock and then impose insane, draconian conditions on accessing that equity, otherwise stock becomes worthless as a compensation mechanism."
dvzcml4,GetOffMyBus,">If they believed in their company, they should be willing to sign off on the risk of the price declining. So they wouldn't have a reason to sell to begin with.."
dvzdkqj,earthwormjim91,"There's plenty of reasons for an executive, especially of a publicly traded company, to sell stock. A lot of times, most of the compensation of an executive is stock. It's not like they just go ""here's a million shares"" once you get hired and thats it. It will be something like ""your compensation package is one million dollars in salary and 12,000 shares per quarter"". This is supposed to incentivise the exec to create growth because that means that their compensation is worth more. But it's worthless if they can't touch it. So what happens is that an exec will set up a plan to sell X number of shares per quarter/year/whatever that they can then actually take home as money. This will be pre-cleared with the SEC. Any other buys or sells must also be cleared with the SEC and follow certain time and share limits."
dvzddkq,earthwormjim91,There's no such thing as insider trading for executives. By definition they have all insider information there is. That's why there are time restrictions and amounts that an exec can sell or buy personally that have to be set up well in advance of their effective date. An exec cannot just dump stock. It all has to go through the SEC and must be pre-planned.
dvzhs3k,Derpyboom,He is selling since January
dvzvfd0,MazeRed,But if all of this stuff has been public how is it insider trading?
dw01uho,adamsmith6413,"It wasn't clear how Cambridge Analytica got their data until a few days ago, people just knew they were using data to influence politics. Facebook knew before the public how the data had been stolen from them and did nothing. Hence any trades made on this information are insider."
dvzaq00,v4n20uver,"""As was planned ... ago before the downturn""said every insider trader"
dvzdl64,zanidor,"Well if you actually have documentation of your plan to sell that was created before the downturn, then yeah it was provably planned before the downturn."
dvzfv9v,RichardEruption,"Since they have so much info to begin with, would you be against an exec buying a shit ton of stock when he realizes they're going to drop something revolutionary next quarter? Or are you only against it when they dump stock?"
dvzjh9g,derp_derpistan,Its not a matter of timliness... its a matter of public knowledge vs private knowledge. If a major active risk is not made public but a select few know and are acting on it... doesnt matter if it happens the day of the info or 2 years later.
dvzbfcf,kosmic_osmo,"you realize a company knows its own numbers before the public does, right?"
dvzfx6e,RichardEruption,"If they get the numbers quarterly, there are 12 months in a year, and you have to file it months in advance, what makes you think they have that much insight to know about the fall? Unless their marketing team is full of genies and prophets this is not likely."
dvzrqqp,kosmic_osmo,and as well all know every good ceo only makes quarterly visits to the accounting dept.... god you guys are dense sometimes.

dw0upu5,chalbersma,Happy Cake Day!
dvzc01m,msiekkinen,You're saying losses aren't realized until you sell? Is there a term for that?
dvzej14,Jeryhn,It's called a loss.
dw09q5l,Soon_coming,"No, it's called an unrealized loss which is a completely different thing."
dvzcui7,A_confusedlover,"piggybacking on this question, someone please answer"
dvzczwq,Soon_coming,I can't tell if this is serious or a joke
dvzj1yc,ravelCet,"Because literally everyone knows what a ""realized loss"" is. Get over yourselves."
dw094j0,Soon_coming,"The original comment comes off as satire so I can't tell if the child comments are continuing the jerk or are seriously looking for answers. If the guy replied he was serious I would've given him an explanation. Not everyone's out to get you, you're not that important."
dvzdevo,frizzykid,"It's an investment. The great thing about investments is until whatever you stop investing in completely is gone, it can still go up. The potential to make money still exists. Did his investment lose value? Yes. That doesn't necessarily mean he lost money. His potential profit margin just went down, but it could go up.It really depends how you look at it. He didn't technically lose anything because he didn't sell out so his stock or whatever it is could still go up in price. But if he sold now he certainly would"
dvzdjub,A_confusedlover,So if an investment of yours is losing value it makes more sense to wait it out and hope for it to go up rather than sell it? At what point is it no longer viable for you to wait for the prices to go back up?
dvzeyj7,jay212127,"Depends on the situation, typically if it drops due to cyclical/macro changes it's better to hold, if it's a firm like a Facebook controversy an analysis should be done to examine it's viability to hit future goals. It can be more profitable to take the initial loss and move to a different industry. Simply holding on bad stocks forever is called bag holding and is part of the sunk-cost fallacy. In the end a lot is subjective and it is why good financial analysts are highly sought after."
dw09l9x,Soon_coming,"Depends on the situation. For a company like Facebook or Apply then yes, they're way too big to fail and this is a one time event. For other companies that file something like chapter 11 bankruptcy or are caught in a huge scandal it's better to get out before it's too late. In some cases it may even be better to ""average down"" where you buy more stock at the new price after a dip so that when the stock goes back up your average cost is lower. Which is what a lot of people are likely doing with Facebook right now."
dw0fone,A_confusedlover,"But in big companies like facebook, the growth stagnates or isn't as drastic when compared to newer successful companies right?"
dw0fsbn,Soon_coming,Of course. You can't expect the same growth rate YoY for companies that large but you don't expect it to decrease either.
dw0g0gu,A_confusedlover,So it's more of a safe long term investment that only pays off if you invest large amounts in the first place
dw0nwt8,Soon_coming,"No because the company continues to grow and make income over time. If you invest early on then yes, your returns will be significantly higher but companies that are large still increase over time. For example FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) are all gaining value over time. They are all considered safe long term investments. Apple has close to a trillion in liquid cash and is constantly releasing new products to gain market share. Amazon is up 88% in the last year, Apple is up close to 25% I think, google is around there as well.All of them consistently beat the market as well. To me that is considered ""paying off"""
dvzds4s,omnidub,>So if an investment of yours is losing value it makes more sense to wait it out and hope for it to go up rather than sell it?Literally no one is saying that. The point being made is there is no such thing as a negative investment until you don't own those assets anymore. I guess bankruptcy and similar things are exceptions but those are rare and not the case here.
dvzdpwl,lax_incense,"There's literally a story that he's been selling stock consistently for a while now, there's probably some losses accrued during current or upcoming sell offs to fund his philanthropic venture"
dw09onm,Soon_coming,"Well yeah, CEOs are constantly selling stock but that stock is an extremely small percentage of their total holdings. So yes he probably has lost some potential value from the sales but nowhere close to 5billion. That 5billion figure is from the total amount of the shares he owns."
dvzdc03,omnidub,Do you need an explanation or are you just looking for a term? Because it's pretty obvious how an investment isn't a loss until you're not in possession of the investment.
dvzdi69,A_confusedlover,Looking for a term.
dvzdlr1,andiam03,The term is “realized losses.” thatsthejoke.jpg
dvzlw99,wanze,"So the finiancial crises of 2008 wasn't really a big deal either, I guess.The millions of people that los–uhm, wait–had their lives ruined, I mean, didn't really lose anything, because even though the value of their assets plummeted, they still _had_ the assets, right?Or are we going to pretend that if they had just held on to those assets, they'd have been fine?By the way, if you ask any Business Economy 101 teacher, they'll tell you that when you appraise something, you do take the value of its assets into account. But I'm guessing they're _obviously_ wrong."
dvzpp3p,South_in_AZ,"The profit/loss is only realized when you sell. The 5 billion loss is only on paper as referenced to the day before. If he does not sell, and in the next 6 month the stock rebounds and gains value relative to today, he will have gained in relation to that snapshot in time.A majority of stocks that lost on paper in the great recession have recovered or gained value since that time.I bought my house in 2007, at the low point in the market I “lost” 1/2 the value in it, yet if I sold today I would make a profit above my original purchase price. I have an investment property I bought in 2010, it has doubled its value, on paper! But if the market tankers again before I sell it I could suffer a “loss” from today's value, and still turn a profit over what I paid for it.."
dvzq09z,wanze,"It's only realized when he sells, yes, but it's still a loss, an [unrealized loss](https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/2017/5/14/unrealized-loss) in fact. Saying it's not a loss is wrong.Saying an unrealized loss isn't a loss is like saying a red apple isn't an apple. The adjective doesn't change what it is. If you only consider green apples to be _real_ apples, then the problem is with your definition."
dvzqknr,South_in_AZ,"its All relative to time, compared to a year ago there is a profit, compared to last week there is a loss. In 6 months there might be a gain or loss."
dvzrro6,wanze,>compared to last week there is a loss.So we agree there's a loss now. That's really all that mattered.
dvzuhz0,Vashiebz,"No, when you are doing your taxes or doing any sort of financial decisions an unrealized lost and a realized lost are two very distinct events.In one scenario, there is a possibility for a increase in the value of the asset, in another the asset has already been sold and the losses are locked in.When you realize a loss on an investment you can actually get a tax credit for that realized loss as well.Their are many reasons to distinguish between the two words. This is why these words exist so everyone knows what is going on, when you use unspecific terms you can mislead people."
dvzwfsr,wanze,"You're arguing a strawman.Nobody is arguing that an unrealized _loss_ and a realized _loss_ are the same. Nobody is arguing there shouldn't be a distinction between the two.However, an unrealized _loss_ is obviously a _loss_. It's in the damn phrase."
dvzzahu,Vashiebz,>So we agree there's a loss now. That's really all that mattered.This sentence is the issue.
dw00car,wanze,Then that's what you should address; not something I didn't say.
dw02e3l,Vashiebz,The previous post explains why that sentence is an issue.
dw0bhns,wanze,"What an arrogant crap answer. If I thought it did, obviously I wouldn't have said it didn't. But instead of clarifying why you thought it did, you just point me back to another comment I already read. Congratulations on being useless."
dw0fmpk,Vashiebz,I don't exist to be useful for you. Also you know now why the terms matter and why I said it is misleading. So I don't what else you would want at this point.
dw0g2ue,wanze,"Then don't bother commenting to me, dipshit. Thanks."
dw0gb0p,Vashiebz,You are ridiculous.
dw0gzaq,wanze,"Because I don't want, by your own admission, your useless comments? Absolutely ridiculous."
dw0htsv,Vashiebz,"Your logic and attitude is ridiculous. I never said my comment was not useful. I made the statement I don't exist to be useful to you, I can be useful and exist for that purpose. You made a comment ""Congratulations for being useless"" as if I have to do that for you as you start calling me a dipshit for explaining how accounting works."
dw0innl,wanze,">Congratulations on being useless.>I don't exist to be useful for you.>I never said my comment was not useful. Your logic and attitude is ridiculous, too, moron. Blocked."
dw0jgtf,Vashiebz,Whatever at this point.
dw09bp1,Soon_coming,The word loss implies realized loss. That's what you're getting mixed up on.Zuckerberg didn't lose 5 Bil. The calculation is coming from his stock holdings which fluctuate so often.
dw0efnl,wanze,"Obviously, we don't agree that it's implied, so it's kind of pointless to say that."
dw0fedd,Soon_coming,"It's not a matter of agreement though, I'm just telling you a fact. If you don't want to believe it that's your prerogative."
dw0h5xd,wanze,"Oh, my mistake, I forgot I just had to say my stuff was fact, too.Okay, so it's not implied. That's fact. If you don't believe that, that's your prerogative."
dw0nemy,Soon_coming,Except in accounting and finance what I'm saying is actually true...
dw0oqjx,wanze,"So basically ""mine is more fact"". Got it. So convinced."

Turned out the employee did have one through his wife's insurance, which wasn't in his work's health records since the appointment took place in a different Healthcare system. Only then was the director caught and found to have been in 10+ employee health recordsHe still works there today.

Of course everyone went to the union about it and sent out a cease and desist order to my management. My management laughed at it (in front of the employees) and said that if anyone refuses, it's a direct order from management. When we told the union of their reactions, they said that we had to comply with direct orders or it could cost us our job or affect our yearly performance down the road... Even though it wasnt apart of our duties and the union sent out a cease and desist. The director of my employment also agreed with management and we were forced to due this duty in the end. They have also changed our shifts without union approval (which is required), and also tried permanently changing our functional statement (job duties) without required union approval. Again, they stepped over the union. And that's just a few of maaaaaaannnnnnnnyyyyy examples.While the union has good intentions, they can be useless if the employer doesn't give two fucks about what the union has to say."

dvzjtsl,P1r4nha,There are plenty of politicians that have already been elected by not accepting money from big business in local and national elections. Some states have public financing already.Even more politicians campaign on getting money out of politics. They are almost all on the Democratic side however. Some of these candidates also challenge incumbent Democrats who are more business friendly.All you gotta do is **vote in primaries**. That's literally the best chance to get the candidate you want in your final election.
dvzm2mh,Pearauth,A handful of politicians not accepting money isn't enough. You need a large part of Congress to be made up of politicians who won't accept money if you want to get rid of the power businesses have in elections.
dvzmpvb,P1r4nha,"With the money-drenched system the US has any politician who doesn't accept money shouldn't have any chance. Most people in media and in Congress believe that as a fact. The DCCC even attacks these candidates because they don't raise money from big donors.But: They are popular and they win primaries and elections. Once people realize that they have a chance to win without money, but with popular policies, more of them will run."

dvyvg4b,gar37bic,"Back 10 years ago or so, I noticed that the value of Dell Computer was varying a bit. Using Michael Dell's number of shares, I figured out that his net worth was jumping up and down by millions every few minutes, hundreds of millions in an hour or day.I pondered how that would affect one's perspective. It seemed to me that the concepts of net worth and the value of one's time just completely falls apart in that situation. For example, one could take a dump and lose - or gain - $5,000,000 before you wipe. The numbers just don't make any sense any more.All you can do is abstract yourself from the equation, and just see what you can do to improve the value of the company, and leave it better off than you found it. And, from talking to real 'old money' people, in fact that turns out to be the key. If the fifth generation (yes, that long) accepts the fact that they don't own the money/assets, the money/assets own you, and you are just the custodian for a decade or two, then your family are on the way to 'old money'. It's no longer about the toys and parties, it's about taking care of something that has lived for a century, and will (if not screwed up) live for another century or 10, producing goods or making life better for everyone.Cases in point: as of a couple of decades ago, the Twining family still owned Twining teas, after over 250 years. And a major producer of Spanish Sherry has been owned by one family since the 1600s."
dvyvrxo,noreally_bot1105,"Another way to think of it: Let's say you have $1 million. If you spend $1,000 a day, you run out of money in 3 years. But if you have $1 billion, you run out of money in 3,000 years. Or, spend $100,000 a day, and run out of money in 30 years, but you will have a lot of stuff.If you are a billionaire, most things are so cheap you could simply act like they are free. You just have a credit card with no limit, and have it paid off automatically each month.

dvz02r4,titty_boobs,>So you don't think how much anything costs any more. Ellen did a segment on this with Bill Gates a couple weeks ago.

dvz4w01,_Bones,"So basically like, he got those two things backwards. Tide pods are like twenty bucks if you get a big container."
dvz5lmb,titty_boobs,There were other things. He got everything except dental floss wrong. Right out of the gate he said a single box of Rice a Roni was $5. And he was asking if $10 was too much for an 8oz box of frozen spinach dip.
dvz6vz4,Castleloch,"This has little to do with him being a billionaire.I watched that episode and I got most of it wrong, other than the detergent. Outside of the detergent and the floss I've never bought any of those other products. I also followed the same train of thought as him on the spinach dip oh it's branded by some restaurant? better double to price of it. While I know spinach dip is cheap, in that case I was surprised it wasn't 10 bucks, cause that's just the type of shit you see in supermarkets whenever it's a ""premium"" brand or whatever they want to call it."

dvzdtu2,Castleloch,"I'm from Canada I don't recall ever seeing those rolls. I do know that like a package of pizza pops is 6-7 bucks for 4 . Generally frozen name brand food is expensive here, for whatever reason. So honestly 20-25 bucks for a bag of those rolls, here, wouldn't seem unreasonable to me,expensive sure; it's largely why I don't buy that stuff because it's prohibitively expensive for convenience unless I'm maybe at a costco or some such.Also to put it in perspective, 25 bucks at a decent restaurant is one meal here. I can't remember the last time I went out for dinner with someone at any sit down restaurant that didn't cost at least 50 bucks."
dvzj05q,sonofaresiii,"> I do know that like a package of pizza pops is 6-7 bucks for 4Those are *way* bigger than a pizza roll, and you're also quoting CAD prices, not USD prices. Converting everything to american, and it would about work out."
dvzij9f,thefloyd,I don't know what your idea of fine dining is but you're looking at at least $25 per entree and it will be small enough you'll need an app or two.But for real just get the prix fixe menu. It's a little more but the value is much better. Where I work we have a $100 5 course menu that would be like $160 if you ordered everything à la carte. Portions are smaller but not $60 smaller.

dvzb0a5,gloomndoom,Is it because he has so much money or that he just doesn't shop? It's got to be that he hasn't set foot in a grocery store or Target in decades.
dvzbegr,ThatInternetGuy,"He never likes shopping. He would order online, or have one of his assistants do it. He's not really in a mood of buying all day long even his wealth is practically unlimited. He could but he doesn't do it. He used to do it in his younger days but it got old real fast. That's why now he focuses on his life purposes and on solving world's health problems. Only things like that makes a billionaire smaller."

dvzoh2x,GuiltySparklez0343,"Idk where he is getting it all from but I know bill gates has said stuff along those lines, at least encouraging philanthropy"
dvzgjm0,lomelyo,Because he doesn't shop. My guess is that anyone that is too famous or that high profile can't go shopping by themselves. Even if they wanted to.Also I would imagine that it's not too uncommon for just one person in a marriage to be in charge of groceries.

Look at most of the nightmare PR scandals other companies have had over the year (i.e. United Airlines) and look at their stock now. United quickly recovered and they're back on track to continue normal business. Investors care about using future cash flows to value the company. It is very rare that any PR controversy can dismantle a company to the point beyond repair.

dvzh9im,xGray3,"I really agree with this. Capitalism isn't inherently the problem here. When capitalism isn't a black hole of greed and when it borrows a good amount of ideas from socialism, it's a really fantastic system. A small company that is running pretty well and is treating its customers and workers well isn't something to get angry at. The problem with capitalism is when gigantic companies dominate markets, overprice their products, treat their workers like shit, use their customers to get rich on things like data or addictions, or lobby the government to change laws to their benefit. In an ideal capitalist society, there would be a vast amount of small companies all in competitive markets. There would be laws keeping the private sector from influencing the government, laws protecting workers and customers, and laws preventing companies from growing too large. If those three things were fulfilled, I'm convinced that capitalism would look much more ideal than it looks today. I think keeping businesses out of government is the first step towards seeing all of that achieved, but it's also the hardest one."

Good work on linking an urban-dictionary definition though, very academic.Even in that thread you linked the top comment contains this:> The problem with them is that they still hire workers for less than the value of their labor, just at a smaller scaleThe critique of petit-bourgeoise is that, although they wish to appear on the side of the workers, they still engage in the same exploitative practice as bourgeoise. Hence why they're called petit-bourgeoise.I don't think it's controversial either. Using a class-based analysis to point out that even small, independent businesses engage in exploitation because of the structure of wage-labour under capitalism is literally just like, good analysis?"

Me pointing out that you using a source which is known for being hyperbolic and then going ""see, this intentionally hyperbolic source proves that all leftists are exactly like this!"" isn't pedantry, it's called ""highlighting a flaw in your argument.""> Literally everything you said acknowledges the correctness of my original statementNo, because you said that ""the far-left hates small business owners."" That's incorrect. The far-left doesn't like the *bourgeoise*, regardless of the size of their business, for reasons which are pretty reasonable when you use leftist analysis. I don't take issue with your tone, I take issue with the fact that you're presenting the left as somehow against small businesses *in particular* rather than exploitative capitalist systems *in general,* of which small businesses are a part.Even the thread you linked from Anarchy101 says things like> I should have prefaced the answer I gave above with the disclaimer that categories like petite bourgeois are imperfect, and were conceived in thoroughly different circumstances to those today. In particular, the workplace of nineteenth century Europe was (to the best of my knowledge) much less fragmented than it is today, and far fewer people were self-employed. So, of course, there will be fringe cases or counterintuitive cases. The argument of whether it is a useful category is for another time.Which sounds pretty far away from ""the left hates small businesses.""And the thing is, I say all this *as a small business owner.* (Admittedly however, I don't employ anyone.) The bourgeoise *are bad*, IMO, and I think an important part of class-based analysis is looking at the cases where the traditional bourgeoise/proletariat boundary is complicated."

dvzn4n3,EastHorse,"> If they're paying fair wages and running a solid company, how is that not making life better?By definition, they have to pay their employees less than the value they generate, or there would be no profit.Capitalism, inherently, represents exploitation of some people by some others."
dw02o4h,zanidor,"I think this view is misguided for a few reasons:1. The value an employee generates when part of a company can be greater than the value of that same effort solo. If you're really good at riveting, you can probably generate more value combining forces with other talents to build airplanes than you can with random freelance riveting work, even if you expend the same effort in each job.2. Organizing a production effort is itself a big job, and companies need to make profits to pay for overhead. This overhead is essential to production, not dependent on financial system.3. Furthermore, deciding where to invest production effort is also a big job. I'm guessing this is where you feel capitalism is exploitative, because the mechanism we use to pay people for this job is giving them a return on good investments. This looks like getting paid for nothing except ""being good at capitalism"", but again the job of choosing how to invest production effort exists independent of financial system, and this is capitalism's method for rewarding that job.So of course I agree that capitalism can be exploitative, as can any system when abused. I don't think, eg, American capitalism is a eutopia, and obviously many people are being compensated disproportionately to their job. However, there are also many good companies that run things right, and switching financial systems doesn't solve the problem of bad actors trying to exploit the system.Edit: To summarize, you're saying capitalism is inherently exploitative. I'm saying I don't think that's true, but it is *exploitable*. But so is every other system we know about."

dvzii4y,bakuretsu,"It always pays to live by Warren Buffet's maxim: in the short term, the stock market is a slot machine, and in the long term, a weighing machine.Focus on the core principles of your business and choose institutional investors who are on board with your long-term goals. Let the market speculators and day traders and short sellers have their fun and ignore those attendant fluctuations.Especially when the bulk of your net worth is tied up in a single company stock like this, it's important to have a plan and don't obsess about the day to day market movements.By plan I mean a 10b5-1 plan to sell shares automatically over time. Shift that money into broader investments, it's part of your compensation. Let the stock prices average out."
dw0ltzv,gar37bic,"Good points.I'll just add, that having your money - or your company - in a low tax situation makes a huge difference on growth. High taxes are a huge drag on growth.For instance, let's say you start out with $1000. if you have $100 in profit, and that is taxed at 35%, you actually have $65 to invest in growth. If you are taxed at 5%, you have $95 to invest. Assume you continue in a linear fashion, after 10 years you will have $1,877 or $2478 respectively. If it's in a tax-free account, even better - $2594. And if you are taxed at 60%, after 10 years you'll only have $1480.This also reminds me - if you are putting your money in good places, money saved in your 20s can be worth 8 to 10 times as much as money you save in your 40s or 50s. I.e., a mere $100/month when you are 22 may be worth nearly as much as $1000/month later in life. $100/month may seem hard when you are young and poor, but it will help you not be old and poor, which sucks worse."

dvzisnw,Strazdas1,"Im sitll sad IMDB killed the boards. the popular ones were a shitshow, but the slower, series decidated boards were very fun and had communities springing around them."
dw0k76s,astroskag,"I thought maybe it was just rose-tinted glasses, but the other day someone linked a ~7 year old AskReddit thread and I went down the rabbit hole of old comments. I found myself literally laughing out loud at some of them, that almost never happens anymore. I mean, survivorship bias and all, this was a particularly good thread if people are still linking it years later, but still, the whole thing felt different. It felt like the Reddit I joined."
dw0lx4f,dcsauce,/r/museumofreddit is a really good sub for nostalgiac posts just like that I usually get lost in old ask Reddit threads for hours. Especially the time traveler AMA lmao
dvziwjn,dr_rentschler,"Community? The sad part is how political reddit got, how outside influence has changed reddit. I'm actually suspecting that reddits big data is being used by government agencies at this point."
dvzi588,Haz_Matt,That's because of Russian trolls all about.
dw095bl,dcsauce,If you think all trolls are Russian there's a problem.
dvztr00,Camwood7,"You can thank spez and the fact he literally does not care if /r The_Donald lynched someone, as long as they provide him ad revenue."
dw093fy,dcsauce,"This is not the Donald's fault. This is way more than that. You wanna talk about ad revenue, throw /u/gallowboob in there, /r/movies, /r/Netflix, /r/technology, and many many of the democratic subs that jumped out since the election. This is a site wide/user wide issue. Reddit has become a giant ad."
dvzd1ru,A_confusedlover,Reddit doesn't ask you for any personal information though. All it has is your username and a stupid email
dvzdy14,tonayanmx,"And a bit of a few of your interests and quirks Edit: it's like a Howgarts for leisure, if you know what I mean... Edit 2: [look](http://reddit.dataoverload.de/karmastats/#a_confusedlover)"
dvzeium,BrianLenz,"I remember seeing one of these kinda Reddit scrapers that gleaned as much information as possible just from comments. Things like gender, location, family members, things you probably own (car makes, dogs, whatever), and some other things.It's pretty crazy the amount of information individuals give out when it's all piled together.EDIT: [Found it](https://snoopsnoo.com/)"
dvzelsc,tonayanmx,"Even lurkers give a lot of info just by subscribing, liking and disliking. A LOT. Add your email and IP address to the picture and you're not as far from Facebook as you may initially think..."
dvzux8l,SwingYourSidehack,"But we like Reddit, so that's different! /s"
dvzvysa,Alderis,"> you're not as far from Facebook as you may initially thinkThe difference is that 99% of the data you can gather about a user on reddit is totally public data. If i post a comment or upvote/downvote a post, that information is visible to every single person who has a computer, internet, and can read the website. While I may or may not like what you do with that information, **I'm** the one who let you have it by posting it publicly with my username attached to it.Now on reddit, my email, IPs, and private messages are NOT posted publicly, and I would have room to complain about that data being used. How much I should validly complain is subjective, but it's greater than 0. On facebook, I have no ground to complain about my friends or firends of friends learning my opinions and general location due to my posts, but I didn't post it to anyone outside of that group (even if that is a fairly large group). The data on my facebook that is meant to not be fully public is much more extensive than what reddit possesses. I don't truly expect them to keep it all private (internet etiquette), but I will demand that they do *everything* rationally possible to keep it to themselves.**TL;DR** Anything we post publicly online with our username attached is fair game. 99% of reddit's data falls into this category, so the 'blame' is on you for oversharing. Remember internet etiquette? Either don't share it publicly, or don't be self-righteous when someone puts 32 and 371.4789 together.Edit: Put TL;DR in the right spot."
dw02jqo,tonayanmx,Your tl;dr is longer than your previous explanation!!
dw03283,Alderis,Is it? I'm pretty sure it's the shortest paragraph of the 3.Edit: Oh I see. I meant it only as one paragraph. I moved it to the bottom to be more clear.

dvzoy82,GuiltySparklez0343,"That thing thinks I am a human hunter, so overall yes scarily accurate."
dvzj5bp,A_confusedlover,"Fair point, but my identity is still safe yeah? As long as I'm careful that is."
dvzhwxz,phreshstart,and your IP address and your exact location and your devices and your favorite subs and your posts and comments and what you upvote and downvote and the time and frequency when you use reddit and I'm bored but probably much much more.
dvzjipd,A_confusedlover,"Agreed, but facebook/instagram have a lot more data, pictures, family, friends, your chats etc."
dvzju5u,phreshstart,"Sure, I just wanted to point out that is much much more than just an email and an username."
dvzdw6t,1man_factory,As if user profiles here aren't extensively data-mined
dvziza1,A_confusedlover,Well could be but there's a lot less to learn about me on reddit than most other social media
dw0fosk,1man_factory,"How so? Reddit hardly seems like a secure place, given how all your posts and comments are tied to individual profiles with emails and subs"
dvziz6m,dr_rentschler,"Uhm you seem to have forgotten that the e-mail is xKeyScores primary selector ... of course you can argue that the e-mail is optional, but if you thought of nothing bad for a moment and gave it to them, you're royally fucked. Through reddit a user can be better profiled than Google and Facebook can ever hope for."
dvzjl4z,A_confusedlover,That's true we give away more information while anonymous. But my identity is still out of reddit's hands right?
dvzk0xf,dr_rentschler,"For reddit sure. But after PRISM we can safely assume that reddit too is open to government agencies, and there goes your anonymity."

dvzm8lo,zippythezigzag,"I understand that might be close to true if you only compare the percentage of the loss. However when you have as much money as him, taking a hit like that doesn't mean it's ramen noodles for the rest of the week."
dvz70vk,USxMARINE,That's not how stock works. He has to sell before there's a loss.
dvzbi9a,lotsofsyrup,he *is* selling. he announced that he would be selling quite a few shares over a period of time back in september last year. but even if that weren't true i think everyone does know that stocks can go back up and the headline is referring to current market value of the stocks.
dvzchn9,shanem,"But the price is now the same value as it was in Oct, so he's getting what is was worth when he made the decision."
dvzdfq5,lotsofsyrup,"i think when he made that decision he would have rightly believed the stock would not stay at the same value for six months in a bull tech market. so either he needed the cash (yea right) or he knew something bad and specific might be coming down the pipe that could screw with the stock price. but that's all pretty beside the point. he had billions of dollars more value in his stocks friday than he does today. it'll go back up and down like stocks do, but people are just talking about what it is right now because it's an incredible swing in wealth to most normal people."
dvzl4f5,Musaks,"> because it's an incredible swing in wealth to most normal peopleyes, but that is the problem...people look at it from a normal person point of view, and then make interpretation as if Zuckerberg was a normal personThe headline is just sensationous and misleading and everyone here thinking that the stock swing is anything but a small annoyance is delusional.Unless the stock crashes and crashes and stays down for months/years it didn't mean much"
dvzs7uz,zaviex,When you are selling the quantity that Zuck owns you don't sell and market prices. You agree large deals and the sales take months
dvzcv9s,Turk1518,"Stocks always go back up after a PR Crisis (as long as you aren't in serious legal trouble). Look at United. They're right back to where they were before they pulled that dude off the flight last year. Investors don't invest in a company because they support their goals or their values. They invest to get a return. This isn't a GofundMe. This is for their own financial sake. And if they see something that is seriously undervalued in accordance to their own projections, they will buy it. Even if it is undervalued due to beating up a dude on a plane. Or selling out your userbase's private information."
dvzdjxe,lotsofsyrup,maybe you replied to the wrong person?
dvzk0b1,ok_reddit,"There's no guarantee a stock will go either up or down. If there was, it would already be priced in. Anecdotal evidence doesn't support any other theories. If a stock is volatile, it has a higher chance of going up than a low volatility stock though."

dvzfm4c,RamblingPedant,"Somebody else here mentioned Hangouts, and I second that. There's also Signal if you want end-to-end encryption, and Allo if you want Google Assistant built directly into your messaging app. As you can tell, Signal and Allo are kinda of an opposite philosophy."
dvzfte6,argv_minus_one,"Of these, only Signal is not proprietary."
dvzfzo1,RamblingPedant,"I know... I didn't figure I needed to throw out a lot of options, because if you're looking for a non-proprietary IM, I believe Signal is good enough. Also I wanted to throw it in so I wasn't only listing Google products."
dvzh7cs,zer0kevin,Thank you. I appreciate the reply.
dvznr3d,youareadildomadam,Going from Facebook to Google is not a fucking solution!
dvzwn5u,RamblingPedant,"In a way I realize that, but there ain't a lot of good competition here. I did put Signal, though, and that's not Google..."
dvzeuxy,smackythefrog,"I use a mix of Hangouts and WhatsApp. Similar functionality in that I can use all my devices, including my desktop, to chat. I don't think this was the case for WhatsApp until recently."
dvzf0qr,theanav,WhatsApp is owned by Facebook by the way so take that as you may
dvzf1ll,smackythefrog,I am dumb. I knew that but forgot about it in the moment.
dvzp4z1,thatguyfromb4,Its encrypted though so its not as bad
dvzg1rj,bobynou,"Same here. Never been to my fb page for months but i use messenger daily. It's pretty, easy to use, everyone has it."

dvzap6n,Zetagammaalphaomega,Until platforms that let you own your own data emerge anyway. Not as far away as you might assume. Outrage is a strong motivator.
dvzdmhn,DOZENS_OF_BUTTS,There are already platforms that allow websites where *nobody* owns the data. Check out /r/zeronet - zeronet is incredible but the lack of mainstream adoption has held it back significantly.
dw027ze,EcoSlaves,I just went into that sub and read like 5 full posts. I still have no fucking clue what it does or is about
dw0479q,DOZENS_OF_BUTTS,"I guess I should've just linked their website instead. https://zeronet.io/The tl;dr of ZeroNet is that it's a combination of several different technologies (primarily involving torrenting) that allows for fully distributed websites to exist. There is no central point of failure and all ZeroNet sites (""zites"") are open source by design, thus allowing for a truly secure and transparent internet. It's still a work in progress but it's currently functional and looks extremely promising."
dw04n1s,EcoSlaves,Just read into it awhile. Turns out it's smart people stuff that I can't wrap my head around. Thanks for trying though!
dvzd8m3,mainfingertopwise,">let you own your own data... outrage is a strong motivatorYou're totally right, and I think it's going to have to be both outrage and a viable alternative.In order to let you own your own data, this hypothetical platform would have to find a different way to make money. Even if it tried to stick with ad revenue, but do so in a more consumer friendly way, they'd probably be screwed - the advertisers themselves benefit from facebook's model, and facebook already has the unbelievably huge user base.Finding money isn't the only problem. The size of facebook's base is a problem in other ways - most obviously, that people will hesitate to leave. In order to be convinced to leave, the new platform will have to be a magical mix of familiar and novel - too similar to facebook, and there's no reason to leave (plus potential copyright/other IP problems.) But if you make it too *different,* there won't be enough of the stuff that people want, and/or they will be intimidated by the differences. Oh, and it can't just be different, it has to be *better.* Then, it's going to have to promote the shit out of itself. It will have to grow at good rate for a decent amount of time, otherwise facebook will just smother it and wait it out. This platform doesn't only have to compete with facebook, but it will also have to *fight* facebook. Facebook might see this as a threat, snap their fingers, and be *super nice* about privacy and data security... for a while, anyway. Or, they might just drop a couple billion dollars on a marketing campaign, nbd. Or they might release some new feature or doodad they've got tucked away. Or harvest the power of their existing infrastructure and mind power to develop and implement that new doodad before the new company even knows what hit them. Something that new platform has going for it is good will and a positive clean track record. Facebook - like countless companies before it - is its own worst enemy. Greed, random mismanagement, and scandal have brought all sorts of companies to their knees. Maybe we'll get lucky, and it won't take decades for *this* behemoth to finally roll over and die, the way it's taken others."
dvzd9fc,mrcleansocks,"I think distributed platforms enabled by cryptocurrency technology could make it so that no one person owns data stored on social media websites. Websites like Facebook, twitter, reddit, etc all have a hard time turning a profit from their users (if they're not selling user data) anyways so why not just make them into decentralized systems that don't need to turn profits? They could act like protocols that serve their only true function, tools of communication and strictly that. No need for algorithmic feeds and/or serving advertisements when nobody needs to make money off of it."
dvzf3pm,wobuxihuanbaichi,"Cryptoassets could solve this problem one day. Decentralized social networks are in their infancy, but once they can scale, they will pose a real threat to Facebook."
dvzfw0k,argv_minus_one,"You mean like how XMPP posed a real threat to Yahoo Messenger/Windows Messenger/AIM/ICQ? Oh wait.The fatal flaw of these sorts of platforms is that *no one uses them,* and that's because they don't have a megacorporation advertising the shit out of them."
dvztpwb,Zetagammaalphaomega,"Megacorps also ensure it survives, but only so long as they do. Decentralized platforms don't have that limitation. They continue to exist so long as it is used by anyone. So far as I can tell, XMPP is still used today. How many of those centralized solutions are, and how useful are they at that scale?"
dw00skv,argv_minus_one,"XMPP is used in some niche settings, but it's not used by the average Joe."
dvzitm1,Strazdas1,Its also a short-lived motivator. Not enough to get people to migrate platforms. See: VOAT.
dvzteq5,Zetagammaalphaomega,"Short lived, but eternal. So long as centralized systems are societal standard for data retention and utilization. They will keep getting targeted and hacked so long as they exist, and the outrage from those incidents will continue to kick the can of progress."
dw1g7kc,Strazdas1,"Its not eternal, though. There is a reason we joke about internet having memory of a hamster. Heck, this very site is built around short lived events and a few days old posts are considered necro here.And centralized systems will remain the societal standard because they are the efficient systems."
dvzcd7h,whoamiamwho,"if I remember correctly, you do own your own data, but accepting the terms and conditions of these companies like fb or google allows them to use it"
dvzbl2n,falconbox,Thankfully I don't use Instagram or WhatsApp.
dvzeers,jagua_haku,Whatsapp is quite useful. It's just data-based texting
dvzeft9,falconbox,"Yeah, but then I'd need to convince everyone I know to download a new app just to text them. Harder than it seems, when everyone has spent the last 10+ years just using regular SMS or iMessage."
dvzg5ma,jagua_haku,It doesn't make sense to use it within the US but it's a great way to communicate with people overseas who don't have iPhones (for iMessage)
dvzft8a,Hidaaan,"Better technology kills its predecessors, it's how its always been, just because I grew up sending MMS's to my crush doesn't mean that the future generation is going to wind up doing that. You're talking about a 'hassle' that is irrelevant in a larger context. Downloading a new app these days, takes about a minute at max and signing up on it takes even less."
dvzlrwn,BriefIntelligence,"If there were better technology currently people wouldn't be using WhatsApp a Facebook owned app. People would have already switched to Telegram, Signal, or whatever alternative you're talking about. Since it has happened it means the alternatives are trash."
dvzfqwr,Hidaaan,"You do know you're in the 0.00001% of people who probably doesn't use either right. The asian market dwells in WhatsApp & since Asia has like 1/3rd of the world's population. That man isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Also, if you really want to be off the grid, you're better not even being on reddit. Data leaks can happen to anyone at anytime. Hell go back to not owning a phone or computer. Use cups with strings attached between them to communicate with your friends and family and while this comment may seem troll-ish in a lot of forms, its really not. I am genuine when I say if you care about your privacy that much, you need to be disconnected from the internet in all forms."
dvzhz4u,DaTrix,"China uses WeChat instead of WhatsApp since the ban, so the population would be nowhere near as high as 1/3rd. Agreed with the rest of your post though. If you want convenience you're going to have to sacrifice something. In this day and age, it's your personal information."
dvzhod1,Grimstar-,"Why is everyone hating the guy? Is it because he's rich/owns the biggest social media site? Did he actually do anything worth hating or is this just some random circle jerk?I don't really keep up with what he's doing so I don't really have an opinion of the guy.Edit: Nice downvotes without answers to a legitimate questions guys, keep jerking."
dvzekkm,PleasantStretch,He will always be a multi billionaire. Nothing will ever change that.
dvzg2o3,esr360,No he will become poor and homeless and then I win
dvzwxzt,theRobzye,Do you say the same thing about Google?
dvzy4iu,XIncognito10,"Yes. Its just Google will be a lot harder to overcome. Thing is, they have their fingers in so many pies, it may be impossible to actually stop them. They have their search, their ads, the entire android ecosystem, waymo, google fibre, project loon. They're everywhere and that scares the crap out of me"
dvzb75r,LIFEofNOOB,"People this rich don't see things in this perspective. They don't chase that 6 billion dollar loss. In fact, they more than likely don't even bat an eye at it or think twice about it. They know it will be made back in quite a short time frame and spend their time and energy of plugging the leak that caused the loss."

dvyyvg8,xof711,Hope FB goes to zero!

dw1cnpd,kickingpplisfun,Honestly it hardly makes a difference beyond your first couple billion- it's already more than a single person could realistically hope to spend in a lifetime without actively pissing it away- dividends alone could easily provide more than $1mil/year.

They just don't accurately reflect any kind of reality. The shift in price here is especially impermanent. Facebook's growth is slowing, but the company owns Instagram and WhatsApp, two of the largest and fastest growing social media platforms. So Mark Zuckerberg hasn't ""lost"" anything unless he sold all his Facebook shares now. For reference, Bill Gates sold off his large stake in Microsoft [over a decade](https://www.geekwire.com/2015/bill-gates-slows-microsoft-stock-sales-in-2015-still-makes-1-5b/).It's a sideways way for people to express their anxiety about social media. Social media promises to connect us but [leaves us feeling isolated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2016/04/30/study-links-heavy-facebook-and-social-media-usage-to-depression/#15163f444b53) and its purpose as a business is [to addict people](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2m3f05/eli5_if_something_is_free_you_are_the_product) in order to package up their free time for advertisers."

dvzm5eb,WhatEvil,If your net worth is measured in the billions you probably don't actually care about money - not really.Past a certain point the only actual benefit to having more money is how much money you can say you have. You're higher up on some rich list. Practically a billion dollars is enough to do basically anything you want for the rest of your life (no matter how old you are when you get a billion). If you're 30 years old and have a billion dollars then you have something like $50k per DAY to spend for the rest of your life. There really isn't much you can't do for that money.
dvzm7su,Atrampoline,"Misleading title for those that don't understand the reality of this situation. He hasn't ""lost"" anything, it's only that his net worth has decreased due to the drop in the price of Facebook stock. If and when the stock recovers (which it probably will), he will have lost nothing and his life will be exactly the same."
dvzngj7,SCphotog,"I really don't think the difference between 65 billion and 75 billion, give or take a couple billion, has much effect on quality of life.Seems to me, anything much over 100 million or so, puts you at the top of the economic chain, where all the things that could possibly matter are concerned.

dvzsb4n,RageAgainstTheAmish,Zuckerberg has lost nothing. He has been dumping facebook stock for a while now. - https://kek.gg/i/5r3dbh.png
dvzt77r,ATTKippy,Am I supposed to feel sad for the man who leaked private information intentionally while at the same time bought the houses of his neighbours to ensure privacy of his own?
dvztsz7,makebelieveworld,So whats the new thing? I am ready to friendster/myspace this facebook garbage. Whats the new one we are using? I want it to be like facebook but without all the intrusive ads and weird algorithms that only show me 5 random friends.
dvzugnn,Qwirk,He hasn't lost shit unless he sells stock while it's down.
dvzusyx,Patranus,The bigger issue here is how the FEC allows publicly available companies to rig the stock classifications to ensure control. The choice should be either/or when it comes to control/leadership and being an public company. There is ZERO mechanism for Zuckerburg to be held accountable by shareholders. Even if he sold all of his “public” shares.
dvzv57z,TheKingOfKolo,He started Facebook by stealing someone else's idea and thought that with money you can buy anything. I guess it serves him right to be punished for helping out and ruining the privacy on one of the biggest (if not the biggest) social networks on the Internet.
dvzv71g,its_Lucifer,I'm more shocked that it took this many years for people to finally realize how Facebook fucks with your privacy.
dw03ej3,boner79,I hope he goes broke like his con-artist identical twin Theranos CEO.
dw0ohq5,Coxemonster,Looks like someone blocked his style
dw0v8sj,TickleMyNeutrino,"Suckerberg has always been a very bad ambasador for the company and he lacks the slick to avoid getting in trouble. He didn't do anything about the ""I See Dead Profiles""-situation before the lawsuits were nearing a resolution he didn't like. He seems to have a policy of never acting for the users interest without significant legislative or political pressure. That is why Facebook will become Facepalm as soon as the fines rain down on them."
dvz353a,Tetragramatron,It's a massive stock buyback scam
dvz44eh,joymode,Good. F that guy
dvza8dl,kneaders,Awwww poor scumbag billionaire
dvzcq58,yrsy,Hope they fail. Can't stand assholes like him. Don't care about his money but he just a jackass..
dvzerom,thailoblue,God I hate that. He didn't lost ANYTHING. If he's not selling today. Poor day traders are the only ones who lost anything. That and panic sellers. By next week the stock will rally though.
dvz8ln5,Unlikelylikelyhood,"Y'all need to learn the difference between Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook the company. Did he lose 5 billion personally? No. He owns only 24% of the shares. Facebook lost. He's lost maybe 1.5b in share value. Again this isn't liquid cash... And it's not ""his"""
dvzbnjo,ShiningBlight,Maybe read the article. Facebook's cap is down about $35 Billion since Friday.
dvzcf94,Drinkingdoc,"Yeah his shares are down much more than 1.5bil. But to OPs point, that loss isn't realized unless he sells.In fact I would bet it's a good time to buy. Many will disagree, but a big sudden price drop is bound to turn around and get evened out in the long term. I doubt a company with Facebook money has anything to worry about."
dvzv9of,Myrmec,That's why I buy up MySpace stock every chance I get
dw05akq,Drinkingdoc,"True, but Facebook is not just Facebook. They have other sites/brands and a whole vault full of $$$"
dvzcq5y,u8eR,That is how stocks work. That's how we measure the value of a stock--its trading price. That's therefore how we can measure a person's wealth--by the value of the equity they own. Of course the gains or losses are not realized until selling the stock (which he has been). But that doesn't stop us from stating that the value of his equity decreased $5 billion from the day before.
dvyr9mb,PabstyLoudmouth,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! Good fuck that sleezebag!!!
dvyrijh,jono20,I think he's going to get by alright with the other 69.5 billion dollars...
dvyvinc,AllThatJazz,"True! Very true! But... still...I must admit that I did relate ever so slightly to /u/PabstyLoudmouth 's expressed sentiment above!

dvz6jlb,b1gd4ta,Did you just say Sam Walton was not rich?
dvyskks,InnerStrawberry,They are talking about a hypothetical sum of 5 billion. They are talking about stock prices. They are not talking about real money.
dvyswgn,PabstyLoudmouth,"He does not have 69B in hard assets either, so what is your point? It's all real money concerned to what we are talking about. That is a decent loss in 1 day for anyone. Nobody sneezes at 5 billion lost in market value. It is going down much quicker now in overnight trading."
dvyt97u,InnerStrawberry,"No, Zuckerberg is not some petty trader, he uses the stock to control his company, and he can't just sell.And even if he did sell, that would crash the stock price instantly.petty stock trading vs. owning a significant stake in a company are two unrelated affairs. Zuckerbergs net worth is a hypothetical number.Market prices only exist during buying and selling. The market value for the stock Zuckerberg owns is unknown, since the act of selling it would have a huge impact on the market."
dvythjs,PabstyLoudmouth,"And it just went down 8% of his worth, that is not insignificant."
dvytx1d,InnerStrawberry,"When someone owns a lot of stock, you can not know the value of said stock, since the act of selling it would change the price of said stock. That is all I am saying.Additionally, I don't really care about this Facebook affair. Stuff you post on Facebook is public, if you want privacy, maybe don't post it."
dvyu1ng,PabstyLoudmouth,Is Private Messenger private? It does say Private right in the name.
dvyumhv,pixl_graphix,"No, it is not. Facebook ""private"" is not a legally binding description of anything. For example ""Milk"" at your local store is milk because the FDA says milk must meet some description. Moreso, the FB TOS probably says something like ""We farm the shit out of every message you send to anyone on our server and sell the metadata of its contents to advertisers and researchers at large"". The only truly private services online are ones in which only you and the receiver of the messages hold the encryption keys."
dvyuzlc,PabstyLoudmouth,"Then that is deception at it's core. Doesn't matter if you bury in your legal crap. People have a general idea of the word private to mean ""in between the two folks talking"" and nobody else. If you violate that blatantly and people get wind of it. Facebook has many replacements. And many lawsuits."
dvyvcvc,pixl_graphix,"> Facebook has many replacements.Name one?>Doesn't matter if you bury in your legal crap.Um, do you even lawyer?>And many lawsuits.Under what pretense in US law? What damages? The US doesn't have strong privacy protections, and most of your ideas of private can easily be 'given away' in terms of service."
dvyw4f8,PabstyLoudmouth,That is why I urge you to help me support electronic communications to be covered by the 4th Amendment. It is the same as being secure in your papers and communications. Are you for that? Fuck all these companies.
dvyx7v7,pixl_graphix,Unfortunately the we have a long way to go. US courts are very much on the side of the 3rd party doctrinehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine
dvyx83x,WikiTextBot,"**Third-party doctrine**The third-party doctrine is a United States legal theory that holds that people who voluntarily give information to third parties—such as banks, phone companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and e-mail servers—have ""no reasonable expectation of privacy."" A lack of privacy protection allows the United States government to obtain information from third parties without a legal warrant and without otherwise complying with the Fourth Amendment prohibition against search and seizure without probable cause and a judicial search warrant. Libertarians typically call this government activity unjustified spying and a violation of individual and privacy rights.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28"

dvzjzy8,autoposting_system,[I think it's important to remember](https://youtu.be/DdF76QhVEFE)
dvzk0x6,Ariakkas10,That's.. Not what that means. His gains were unrealized. He hasn't lost anything
dvzk2bu,extremetolerance2013,only a flesh wound
dvzk3jd,,Can we make it to 10? I'm sure we can people!
dvzk8bw,1h8fulkat,Tis but a drop.in the bucket
dvzk985,thePhoneOperater,Not bad for stolen goods.
dvzkbvz,senorchaos718,Just think if GDPR was active.
dvzkf3c,PhillGuy,So he still has A LOT of money still. He could loose ten of billions and still have a lot.
dvzkfjc,CDuddng,Sir you've lost $ 5 billionMZ: *monotone* Huh. I didn't notice. Wow. That's wild.
dvzkgi5,CokeDigler,I hope he's hung for treason.
dvzkjt4,trailmixofthedamned,oh so rich guy is still rich....😒😒😒
dvzkogx,crooks4hire,"This is the equivalent of saying ""It's low tide right now""..."
dvzkska,PM-ME-all-Your-Tits,That doesn‘t make any sense. I didn‘t even know that all those forbes people are calculated with stocks. That‘s not money. If they would sell everything then the price would drop and the actual amount of cash would be less right?
dvzky7u,meddlingmages,$5 billion vapor dollars
dvzl4ih,escapefromelba,On paper. Next week he'll probably be up again. It's not like the money mysteriously disappeared from his bank account.
dvzlb5y,destinyplayer1,"Oh no, how will he ever finish building that huge wall around his Hawaii cottage?"
dvzljbp,Beldierk,How about that Facebook Live Video Optimizer... bad timing... and the comments are already disabled!!
dvzlkcs,joewilk,"His shares dropped five percent in value, does he have that much in Facebook?"
dvzllm6,txroller,I'd say with the implication of how facebook was used in a presidential election he is doing okay. i mean if this were to happen in another country the consequences would be far worse
dvzlotn,turtleh,It's comforting to know that no one is sympathetic with this weirdo.
dvzlpb7,aspoels,Lets make this stupid fucker loose more money.
dvzltz6,MagicSPA,"I don't care about Facebook as such, I only care about the consequences for Oculus Rift."
dvzlw6s,Arcueid01,He is a greedy little fuck anyway.
dvzly6q,Dulse_eater,He'll be fine
dvzm0x1,Captain_Farts_,[No wonder he tried to get everyone kicked off that island](https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14327854/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-hawaii-kauai-property-lawsuits) ... he is probably pretty scared of his own shadow at this point.
dvzm1y4,DeadliestDerek,Good. Fuck this guy.
dvzm4lc,Tanakreshna,"After shit-ton of ads in Facebook, and Instagram, **HE DESERVES IT!**"
dvzmb7b,ChipsAndSmokesLetsGo,This is what you get for allowing parents on Facebook.
dvzmdgi,usrevenge,Maybe he should spend 7 billion seconds in prison.
dvzme0t,steamynachos,And he can gain it all back tomorrow...
dvzmrov,Neeaccount123,That's some WhatsApp money
dvzn3xk,biddee,Who really needs that much money? $65 billion dollars is 3 times the GDP of Trinidad & Tobago. No single person needs 3 times the GDP of a country of more than a million people.
dvzn6c3,EEightyFive,"What a shitty article. Hey lets compare the net worth this year of all these multi-billionaire's, look at the size of their DICKS!"
dvzn6xc,Gooners84,Why not just retire at this point? He won't be able to spend what he has in 10 lifetimes. Facebook is dead.
dvznoey,Mc_Lov1n,"Good, fuck that little bitch."
dvznszs,ChipAyten,Everyone will be back for those socially manufactured tidbits of endorphin and reassurances. Just wait until the next political broo-ha-ha.
dvznxlp,rapidpeacock,Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Also he doesn't care. It'll come back in a month
dvzo1m6,Slowjams,Something tells me he'll land on his feet.
dvzo2gg,JohnCarpenterLives,"Good thing he sold off $500 million worth of stock a day before all the bad news, huh?"
dvzo54u,smellybigfoot,Alright programmer and designers! There is a crack in the armor! Make a replacement and get rich!
dvzo6eh,SPGear,"No, Facebook stock has dropped that much."
dvzoa6o,firesidefire,Fuck Mark Zuckerberg
dvzonpw,dieseldog09,They need to lose more.
dvzos2z,GabeDef,"He should be in jail. He aided a hostile country to influence the elections. The means for “legal” spying was gamed by Russians in hopes of influencing the election. FB execs knew where the money was coming from, and they knew what the targeted ads were designed to do. Those FB execs should be rounded up and sent to prison. They knew what they were doing."
dvzotkk,jkeegan123,What is with the schadenfreude reporting that Zuckerberg is 5 bn poorer? Why does this make people happy? I'm not a Zucker-fan but really... People are whooping and hollering that he's doing badly... Why?
dvzpeuu,Future_Shocked,"end this shit, please everyone migrate away from this toxic application."
dvzpqw8,jcfig2612,5 bil is nothing to this dude..its his power and influence thats hes more concerned about..he and bezos are megalomaniacs..
dvzpr9u,schlemmla,"I have no doubt as to the truth of this, but is it also possible that this has been released to smear/discredit/damage facebook strategically?"
dvzr753,Prygon,I knew about it a year ago. It's no scandal. CA is also responsible for brexit.
dvzpzv0,ben70,Sometimes two wrongs really do make a right.
dvzq8xr,slinkit,This is not necessarily a good thing considering he donates all of his income to charity
dvzqubx,mygodhasabiggerdick,Proof...?
dvzso2n,Penguinmaster153,"In Dec 2016 him and his wife said they'd donate 99% of their wealth, it came out a week later that they just shifted that money to their own LLC, which is only donating up to 1% a year to actual charities, and as an LLC and not a charity, can do all kinds of things charities can't with the money like lobbying. [Source](https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/12/11/zuckerbergs-46b-charitable-gift-not-what-it-seems.html). So yes, money was donated, but not nearly as much as was initially expected and was clearly done solely to garner attention."
dw1t8jh,slinkit,Didn't know this. Damn shame
dvzqllw,some_random_alt,What does a robot need with that kind of money anyway?
dvzqlxy,Tanuki_Attack,"Huh. I when I lose $5, i dropped it on the street. When the wealthy lose money, it's not money but asset value."
dvzqmby,growonlittlejobbies,"Gosh, I hope this doesn't ruin his plans to run for President. That'd be a shame."
dvzqppr,Barrett420k,He don't need no water let the mother fucker burn...burn mother fucker... burn 🎶
dvzqthn,mygodhasabiggerdick,Boo-motherfucking-hoo.
dvzqv7t,Adamant_Majority,Can someone explain to me how he would believe he even has the slightest chance at being president?
dvzr0d9,supafly208,Because being president is a fucking joke nowadays. It's solely a position used to gain leverage for personal profit.
dvzra9q,Adamant_Majority,"I understand all that, doesn't make him any more electable. As much fun as it would be to see the Democratic Party run another unelectable candidate, I'd rather make some progress as a country."
dvzr3bl,Prygon,So why not him?
dvzr7yc,supafly208,It could be him.
dvzr9km,lsx376,That includes Obama too you know...
dvzqy8b,Goweschon,"Which sounds impressive to you and me, but he probably didn't even flinch."
dvzrm2z,fenderbiz,He should have sold the top.
dvzrsxg,ellieD,Ouch! Shoulda took that trip to Hawaii! (What I said in the last crash!)
dvzrtnd,doomsdesire6,Feelsgoodman
dvzs1yj,youcaneatme,I have a hard time sympathizing with billionaires who loose pocket change.
dvzs8w9,da_ting_go,He will be fine.
dvzsaiu,zoidbergx,he doesnt deserve that last name
dvzsefa,neknekmo2000,isnt reddit us centric? y'all poor over there? where is the milk and honey?
dvzsg5b,TheZeusHimSelf1,Lets make it go bankrupt
dvzslnc,,Haha i hope zuckerfuck goes bankrupt and ends up on the side of the road. Fuck him.
dvzstif,Intense_introvert,Good. He needs to lose the rest.
dvzt7w6,nohuddle12,Check back in 3 years and let me know the long term effect
dvzthsd,campbellm,I remember Leo talking about this firm and Facebook a couple years ago on a variety of the TWIT network podcasts; it's not like they didn't know what was going on.
dvztmjv,cartmenbrah,He may lose more than just money.
dvztmxn,johnnyv125,He'll get it all back in a month
dvzu48s,sreid,Oh poor Zuck. His net worth goes from 80 billion to 75 billion....If there is one thing i'd love to see happen is Facebook have a meteoric crash to bankruptcy taking along most of his earnings with it.
dvzu8cr,ToFat2Run,Make that $50 billion and I'll squeal like a little girl.
dvzv0hq,elton_johns_glasses,"So serious question - people need their social media fill now. If there's a mass exodus, what's the alternative? People can't go to Instagram because it's owned by Facebook. Snap is wildly different and seems to be most popular among teens. Twitter is also much different and something a lot of people just don't get."
dvzv6ds,goddessofwaterpolo,He'll be alright
dvzv8f8,zhico,He will get them back when he's president.
dvzwbip,Tylertooo,good. but those are rookie numbers. they gotta get those numbers up.
dvzxbmy,nootyface,What does this actually mean? Where has this 5 billion gone?
dvzyotq,hashparty,Trump that shit into MySpace.
dw007hv,from_Terra,"our thoughts and prayers, mark."
dw00imq,i_deserve_less,Short FB. Has anyone else noticed a lot of advertising for Facebook lately? They know it's over. They're trying a last-ditch add campaign. They knew a while ago that its over.
dw02ckb,CyberPickle9000,Good. That fucker needs to be taught a lesson. If losing 5 billion is what it takes then so be it. It would be nice if it was even more.

dw0ed6v,entchilllada,"Haven't had a Facebook in 2+ years. If this doesn't motivate people to follow suit, I'm not sure what will. This proves that we, the people, CAN make change. And the last thing the government wants is for us to realize this."
dw0eeam,haragoshi,All I see are discounted facebook shares.
dw0f36p,Harveyweinstein69,This utter piece of shit of a human being is going to say something nice about trans people and then run for president and half of our population will eat it up.
dw0zvcy,PutmeinKoch,Worked for Trump
dw0gxpp,calguy99,I'm sure $5 billion is a nothing for him and he deserves it!
dw2diug,iZen2,"Instead of deleting my Facebook account, I just randomly changed ALL of my personal information. My date of birth, my gender, my likes, movies attended, who I'm in a relationship with, places lived, places I've visited, spouse's name, home location, occupation, I added a bunch of random friends, and added a bunch of random photos I got off the internet..... all just to fuck with Facebook's algorithms! #FuckFacebook with a smile!"
dwq1hk3,hirehereseo,Here is the great article please review and share your views..https://medium.com/@hirehereseo/data-data-everywhere-and-certainly-a-data-overload-1ed8f907274f
dwtedp3,Not_a_frank,Mark is fine he did nothing wrong the same data is used for advertising in every app on any device and this should not go to the capital this is not a criminal offense or data breach and if you do not want your data to be used than get rid of all of you devices computers readers everything twitter Reddit tumblr Snapchat all social Media uses this data so stop complaining that trump is your president their was no collusion with Russia or Facebook so before you accuse a large company just because you don't like your president trump is undoing everything Obama did wrong frankly Obama did nothing right so shut up and stop creating fake problems
dvz7ha6,goodswimma,"No tears were shed, whilst writing this comment"
dvz4vly,PM_ME_HAIRLESS_CATS,So much for the good zucc.

dvzczh1,Dirtydud,"If facebook had a mouth, it would eat a lot of ass."
dvzd2r4,johnyann,Well if you're a smart investor then you're buying the fuck out of Facebook stock as soon as you can. This is only proof that Facebook's psychographic data is worth it's weight in gold for marketers and campaigners.
dvzf8qk,Daveleeog,"> Well if you're a smart investor then you're buying the fuck out of Facebook stock as soon as you can.If they're losing money and there is a campaign going to push for people to deactivate their FB profiles, I'd wait until there's a trend.Or buy puts"

dvze8s8,Grungle4u,Zuckerberg? more like Fuckinturd amirite?
dvzeafp,Rickyrider35,"It's but a tiny little slice of what he deserves, after the billions of dollars he's made off the theft and exploitation of the millions of users' information. The more you dig up about Facebook the more you realise how shit of a company it is..."
dvzekt2,Bralzor,Maybe next time you'll read all the things you agreed to when making your account.
dvzh9af,CRISPR,He did not lose anything. You people need to stop treating stocks as money
dvzmm1y,billwashere,My only response...Good!I hate that fucker.
dvzn5wv,redbonedit,Pfffff we can beat that. Let's go for 10 billion. Dump Facebook and whatever the hell you old people do with it
dvzoywi,andybfmv96,Wish I had 5 billion to lose
dvzp338,Delica,"Mark Zuckerberg goes to a fancy restaurant with paid friends. Their tab at the end of the night is $20,000.He stares into the server's eyes as he moves his pen over the line for writing a tip. He hands it to them and it says...Tip: invent Facebook lololol"
dvztsq9,greengreen995,I hate this shit. You only lose money if you're selling. Did he sell all of his stock yesterday? No. He didn't lose shit.
dvyy6ev,objectivedesigning,Basically no one should have $5 Billion anyway.
dvzd21l,IAMA-Dragon-AMA,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. I completely agree it's an amount of money and therefore power no individual should control. I'm all for success leading to certain benefits including spending stupid amounts of money on things you don't need. Really multiple millions, whatever. A billion dollars is outside of that range to where I'm not sure most people can understand it. If you have 30,000 in the bank, which would represent a year of saving every penny for someone well above the poverty line, then the equivalent to the amount of your liquid net worth you'd spend on a 1.50$ bottle of water to someone with 5 billion dollars would be 250,000$. No person needs that and frankly it feels irresponsible for a society to work that way."
dvyx371,matt23x,"Ok, woah...I must be seeing something here...is the narrative being spun here actually that this was to help *trump* or blaming the right????? ugh, no..facebook was and has always been solidly anti-trump and pro left. they [illegally helped the obama campaign](https://www.dailywire.com/news/28424/ex-obama-campaign-official-heres-how-we-were-able-james-barrett) and i would suspect the same for clinton. there simply isnt a way to spin it, this story favors trump and theres no logical way around that"

dw04xyp,matt23x,"That's all they have, it's the common trend. T_D *always* has stories before anywhere else, and the highest quality of conversations to."
dvzlhk1,PSYKO_Inc,"I think you may have mistaken what the article was trying to say; the market as a whole is down right now based on news of Trump's proposed tarriffs/embargoes, along with the departure of his chief economic advisor. Investors are getting spooked and cashing out. News of FB's data breaches are causing a drop in FB's stock price at the same time, compounding the losses. It's only referencing the timing of the drops, not implying any correlation."
