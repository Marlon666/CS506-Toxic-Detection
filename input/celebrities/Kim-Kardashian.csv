d7yao18,sinfiery,I don't think you are getting work with a 0 Q score. There is no being a celebrity without people caring about you.
d7ycx0j,grindemup,"A zero could also be a well-known but controversial figure, such that the hatred cancels out the likability.edit: apparently I should have RTFA. See /u/dracosuave's comment"

d7ybg9n,apekillape,"I only saw it for the first time a few weeks ago, and immediately when the credits started I realized it was easily in my Top 2 or 3 (depending on how I felt about the first Avengers that day). Ant-man is a truly entertaining and well made film, second only to the first Iron Man film in my opinion.My admiration for that film is compounded by the fact that it's almost the same story as Iron Man, and they still made it that good and not repetitive."

d7y27uc,cippopotomas,>Most people don't really hate Beiber or Kim.Q scores use surveys so these claims are based on actual data. In this data 63% of people disliked Justin Beiber and 71% disliked Kim. Do you have actual data to support your claim that these findings are false?
d7y3faq,P00PYD1CK,I think he is saying how many people have actually met them in these surveys. Do they hate them or the image of them the media produced.
d7y63n0,PapaSmurphy,The entire score is about how celebrities are *perceived* by the general public. Whether or not the people surveyed actually met the celebrity isn't taken into account because they only care about perceived media image.
d7y3fv4,,"These surveys are shit anyways. They are just celebrities, not mass murderers or dictators... if you 'hate' them without knowing them personally you are just following what is popular and being stupid as fuck"
d7y4qdm,kopkiwi,"> Most people don't really hate Beiber or KimNo, we hate them. For good reason."
d7y7k7g,Kinggod13,"Alright, what's your reason for hating someone you've never met? Why not a more reasonable emotion like apathy?"
d7y8lof,throwaway08255,"My reason for hating those two, and some others, is what I perceive to be a net negative impact to society as a whole. I truly believe the world be better off without Beiber egging people's houses and driving sports cars at excessive speeds through his neighborhood and Kim's self promotion to encourage in app purchases among other products. Both of them are in positions to be so much better examples to their fans, and while their words may encourage good behavior, their actions are atrocious."
d7yculu,th3greg,"Bieber makes some good, positive music though, and did most his negative things when he was pretty young. If I was 19 and as wealthy as he was I can't say I wouldn't be a total double. Keep in mind that he was 15 when he put out his first platinum record. That much wealth and fame that young has to go to your head pretty quickly. Recently he seems to be staying out of the spotlight, making good music (matter of opinion), and is out doing positive things for people. People have hated on Justin Bieber since before his ""bad boy"" phase though. Ever since he put out ""baby"" people have had an unreasonable disdain for him because he made a song that wasn't targeted toward them and they found it annoying. I'll admit I was one of those people early on."
d7yhtd7,throwaway08255,"I'll leave the music alone, taste is subjective and I don't expect everyone to like/dislike the same stuff I do.The fact that this kid had DUI and drag racing charges filed, charges for egging his neighbors house in addition to a ""treasure trove of drugs"" per TMZ and the LA county sheriff found during that investigation, and numerous encounters between his encourage and the public lead me to believe he is a poor role model, and in my opinion, a poor person.I'm not alone since the petition to deport him and revoke his visa that referenced these behaviors got 273,968 signatures."
d7xnnsu,mrshatnertoyou,">This is not so for Justin Bieber, who has the second-highest negative Q Score rating at 63. Bieber's negative rating, Schafer says, doesn't stem from any kind of ironic ""negative"" admiration: it just means most people dislike him.Ouch.>Denzel Washington, Steven Spielberg and Betty White are tied for second most popular with a positive Q Score rating of 44.Happy to see Betty White on there."

d7ym0w5,REDDITATO_,"It doesn't deserve the hate it (sometimes) gets, because it's a perfectly good action/destruction movie, but great is kinda pushing it. It's a pretty generic alien invasion movie. I like it, but I'm surprised to hear it's a Spielberg movie."
d7ymryi,Perturbed_Spartan,"I definitely wouldn't call War of the Worlds an ""action"" movie. Sure things blow up but the tone of the movie is much closer to horror. But it's not jump scare horror. Its a pervasive and consistent fear of something much more powerful than us finally come to sweep humanity aside. The movie nails this. Everything about the tripods is unsettling. The way they move, how they just make people disappear with no effort, and that fucking foghorn. A sound that simultaneously and clearly communicates two things: **Alien** and **Power**. In an action movie that first scene with the tripod would be used to set the stakes. To establish a threat for the hero's to over come and next scene they leap into action. But in War of the Worlds that scene IS the movie. We spend the rest of the film running *away* from that not towards it.Whereas a movie like Independence Day which is similar in plot (Aliens invade, aliens kill humans, aliens catch cold, humans kill aliens) focuses on characters who present a broad view of what's happening world wide (or at least America wide), Tom Cruise's character is in the dark for practically the entire movie. He doesn't know what's happening out there. If we're winning or losing. All he knows is what he sees which is a world inexorably being overtaken by an unknown other. This radically changes the tone and feeling of the film.I challenge you to name me another ""generic alien invasion movie"" that captures an ounce of War of the Worlds tension and dread."
d7yo4nv,REDDITATO_,"That's a perfectly valid interpretation of that movie, I just didn't get any of those feelings watching it. Maybe it just struck different chords with each of us. While I personally didn't feel the dread and horror, I can see that the elements are there. I guess I just didn't connect with those themes and therefore didn't even notice them, but there's no arguing they're there once you've pointed them out. I might watch it again soon with your points in mind and see if I like it better."

d7ym5il,REDDITATO_,"I'm the least picky reader ever and I like almost everything, but that book was so fucking shitty. It read like a Wikipedia article about 80s pop culture instead of a novel. There's even an entire chapter that's just describing scenes from War Games. It was my first cyberpunk book and almost made me think the whole genre was trash. Luckily the next book I read was Snow Crash and I realized it was just the author I disliked.That being said, I really think it could make a great movie if handled correctly. Focus mostly on the plot, and tone the 80s shit down to the bare necessities to the plot/visual and background stuff for world building. This could be really cool."
d7ys33q,spikeyfreak,"> Wikipedia article about 80s pop culture instead of a novel.I just want someone to figure out how much time it would actually take to know all of the information that the characters knew. It was stupid. You can't know everything from every show AND game AND book. It would take a thousand years to consume all of the entertainment that they had memorized.However, I was born in the mid 70s and I still really, really like the book. Please don't kill me."
d7yx221,pt4117,Not to mention getting that good at all those games.
d7ynmw2,idonotget_it,Oh yeah! I agree with you. I find the writing style too amateurish compared to other scifi novels. I find it's mostly like another typical teen novel. It bombarded you with too many 80's reference. I still enjoyed the plot and universe created. I'm excited for the movie because I wanna see how Spielberg will handle the visual aspect of the book.I can forgive Cline since it's his 1st novel and I haven't had the chance to read Armada.
d7yw8gj,jh2011,I'm not. The only way this ends is with the book ruined. I don't see how it's possible to turn that book into a good film.
d7ybv9z,MikoSqz,"It's not a list of who makes the best movies, it's a list of who people like best. Spielberg seems very sincere and likable.

d7yrxxb,MaxReingold,These results were published in 2015 and likely were for the year 2014. It does say 2015 but it mostly talks about 2013's results. I think Cosby's negative rating is even higher these days.

d7ys4b9,ErmBern,Right? That seems exactly like the metric you would want to look over when you are deciding who you want promoting your product/project.

He has the same talents he had when he was on YouTube, his sound is just now in line with what older people want to hear. Whoever made his music was catering to one audience, now they are catering to another. Every other pop star on his level has had the same ""growth"" from bubble gum to this newly popular electro-pop-R&B-trap genre that literally all pop music sounds like right now (Selena, Ariana, Britney, Nick Jonas). He isn't personally doing anything different, he just has better songwriters and producers..."
d7xxsa1,MonkeyBones,"What do you know, trendy musicians follow the trends. I just like that he has some better producers laying down his tracks for him now. To tell you the truth I had no interest in him until I heard Where are You Know."
d7y0qjc,puddle_gum,"I have nothing against JB and I generally like pop music. However, I wouldn't even give him the credit of ""following the trends"". My whole point was that at the end of the day, none of this is coming from Justin Bieber himself. All he has to do is sing what is put in front of him."

d7y6olc,,"As a former hater, now guilty-pleasure listener of Bieber's new stuff: it's the production, sure, but also the writing. It has become more personal and relateable. He's still no shakespeare, but at least it's much better than his early work, which was absolutely meaningless. I can at least listen to his newer songs without being annoyed by someone singing a lot of words without actually saying anything. But then he makes a track like Sorry where he acts like a complete douche in the lyrics. It's still hit and miss I guess."
d7ytcwp,puddle_gum,I wouldn't consider it a guilty pleasure if it's popular.
d7ytvg7,,I see it that way. He's not so popular in my social circles.
d7y2pvl,nadroj19,"I don't necessarily agree that he has only now become a decent musician because he obviously was extremely talented when he was a YouTube hit. But I would argue that he has more talent then when he was younger. Due to his exposure and working with different styles I am sure that he is a much more rounded musician. That and I am sure he has a very good team surrounding him helping him train his voice and other musical abilities. I say this as someone who isn't really into his music, but can see that he is very talented. And as a person I don't really care what trouble he gets in or whatever. I am sure that if I was given millions of dollars at that age I would be an idiot as well, if not worse."

d7y20uq,NewToSociety,"Google it. Bieber is worth the most of your four examples, with $200 mil. but Denzel (140 mil) has more than twice as much as Kim (66.8 mil). Betty does quite well at 45 mil.You're dead wrong about the most popular being worth less than the most hated, though. Freeman is worth 150 mil. Hanks is worth 350 mil. And Spielberg is worth 3.7 BILLION. But that's not the point. You said that nobody would argue that the most hated are making more money than the most loved, and here I am, arguing."
d7y2is8,Eze-Wong,"Well I specifically said I doubt JB and the Kardashians are worth more than Betty White or Denzel specifically.As for the general statement it's just a generality. It's not going to be true in every case and I doubt it would. I was saying it sarcastically though... like the whole thing is more of a ""why do people hated make money"" social commentary. Edit: Also googled it, says Kim Kardashins net worth is $150 mil and Denzel is 140 mil. So umm, guess It's still right. But don't really care since I said it as a joke anyways."

d7y59dn,MrFlac00,"She's not really celebrity, she's only really hated by a small portion portion of the internet, and she makes pretty good amounts of money (but not really that much in the grand scheme of things)."
d7y5h9c,Eze-Wong,"Hmm I don' know if it's a small portion. At least the youtubers I've seen unanimously hate her. Then again, I might be an echochamber of similar thoughts so who knows.Though my comment was mostly in jest ..."
d7xn6mx,powerscunner,So a movie with Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman fighting Kim Kardashian should be a slam dunk.I might watch that if there was a lot of punching.
d7xnlms,,That sounds awful. Who would watch a movie with Kim Kardashian in it? Tom Hanks fighting Morgan Freeman sounds better.
d7y1xzn,unique-name-9035768,> Tom Hanks fighting Morgan Freeman sounds better.What about a movie where Tom Hanks operates different modes of transportation while Morgan Freeman narrates what he sees out the window?

MAYBE WE OUTTA LAY OFF THE COAL FOR NOW!"" Screamed Tom Hanks jovially, as he frantically pulls the train siren chain. -the camera pulls out to a wide landscape shot with the train rumbling in the foreground, smoke billowing from the stack as the siren wails. birds fly off in the distance, startled by the sound-Morgan freeman narrates as the train slowly fades into the distance""It's been 4 weeks with Tom. On an passenger airplane, container ship, a FedEx plane, and even a spacecraft around the moon. I've learned two things on this long journey. Forrest Gump was less of a character than he was Tom just letting himself be who he is on screen. And the man can not navigate anything for shit.""The train starts to careen off the track due to excess speed.

d7y6l2q,FrenchCuirassier,"My feeling is that there is a shady PR company out there pretending like so many people saw her sex tape back in the day and then she sued and the tabloids kept talking about it.But the reality is, no one saw her sex tape at the time. It is all a big shady PR campaign and everyone was looking at other types of porn on the internet because no one even knew Kim at the time. It's all fake. The idea that people saw her sex tape when it was released, even that was fake. No one gave a shit, they manufactured the rumors that attempted to gossip about how people saw her sex tape and then people finally saw her sex tape as a result of rumors of people seeing her sex tape. People searched the sex tape, because they thought other people were watching the sex tape. They were duped. Manufacturing rumors about yourself and rumors about your own popularity has got to be the most low-life con there is.I mean even her dad was a shady lawyer, so it's not like her family is unfamiliar with cons."

d7yowos,Firebat12,So it was all streisand effect?
d7zonn0,FrenchCuirassier,indeed.
d7ypuuy,Bicolore,This isn't shady PR its just PR.The real question is if Kim Kardashian is an absolute master of media manipulation and genuinely wants to be perceived the way she is or is she just a willing stooge for the media to sell.To be honest the latter is far more likely but the former would be brilliant especially if she did a Kaiser Soze level exit.
d7y76sg,MiamiBeachmoney,"lol ""shady pr company"" it's good business. I know this will get downvoted by those who have never started a company but the goal of a business is to maximize profits.

No. There is plenty of other options.

d7y4eza,IvyGold,"I've watched every ep as it aired. The seasons vary notably in quality. But you'd be fine up until I think season 5 or maybe 6. As soon as you hear the word ""leviathan,"" you can judge. Last season, the 11th, was very good I thought."
d7yaxk6,suegii,"I feel like seasons 6-9 represent a real slump in creativity, but seasons 10 and 11 were fairly worthwhile. I feel like they've tried to jump the shark and get themselves cancelled every season since 4 and have attained some sort of southparkian immortality because of it. The show already went way past what the writers were really prepared for but they seem to have gotten their shit together and as long as this new season doesn't tank I could see the show going on to be the American Dr. Who"
d7ye31v,cleeder,"The problem with the show right now is it suffers from it's own success. Some spoilers.Sam and Dean have killed every living type-of-thing on the planet. They've killed angels, gods, demons. They've *BEEN* demons (Well, one of them). They've both died and come back to life (I think more than once each). They've literally strolled into hell like it was poorly guarded minimum security prison and walked back out. It's clear that there is nothing that can really hurt them. Season 10 at least acknowledged this with the Mark, and Season 11 introduced an actual challenge for them again."
d7yh7j5,suegii,"The thing is the writers slipped into power creep early because it's the easiest way to find your next villain(what's scarier than a shark? A bigger shark) Once angels were on the scene and the apocalypse clock became the motivator they had no bigger card to play than ""if you fail the world ends"" honestly the fact that they didn't have to write god in until like six-seven seasons after that is a testament to the creativity of the writers but it's not the writing that keeps the show going; Supernatural proves one very important tenet of tv shows: it's the acting that matters not the plot."
d7y1viv,SexyMrSkeltal,"Only really the original run, it was ""brought back"", or the network refused to let it end despite it already having an actual ending, so now they just pump out shit after shit, with occasional good episodes here or there. If you really enjoy the chemistry between the two actors, then the newer stuff isn't bad, but if you're in it for the story, then I'd stop after the original run."
d7yaolu,suegii,"Supernatural is and always has been a monster of the week show, the plot is not the selling point, the characters and jokes contained within definitely are"
d7ytx63,TheOneTonWanton,"That may well be the case, but anyone that tries to argue the show wasn't supposed to end at season 5 is fooling themselves. There was a very clear arc from season 1 to 5 with a very clear ending that the showrunners/network then chose to ignore completely for the sake of all them fat stacks."
d7z9jin,suegii,"I'm not saying you're wrong, but considering how many worse shows get perpetuated, I really don't mind this one"
d7z9r8n,TheOneTonWanton,"I certainly agree with you, and I don't necessarily mind it myself, but it cheapened the show to the point I just stopped caring and therefor stopped watching. Obviously they've still got plenty of viewers/fans and make plenty of money, and me not watching it anymore doesn't matter, but I know I'm not the only one in the fall-off crowd."
d7z9xzi,suegii,I nearly gave up about five times a season during seasons 6 through 9
d7y58lp,Soranic,Which season should we bail at?
d7y64dz,Magyman,"After season 5. The ""end"" is pretty obvious, too."

d7y7xkw,Soranic,Thank you.
d7y4ahd,koobstylz,"Start it, but be very ready to stop watching it some time after season 2. Goes downhill fast."
d7ydstf,cleeder,After season 2? It doesn't even really get good until then.
d7yepx7,koobstylz,"Oh that's why I'm being downvoted? Gotcha, no i just meant exactly what i said, some time after 2. It's been years since I've seen it and I totally couldn't remember when I stopped watching, so I kept it vague. Guess I was not clear enough."

The infected began a campaign to spread the virus. Community leaders donate chips to the poor. Doctors prescribe them to their patients and idols promote it to their followers. At the head of this campaign is a socialite unlike any other (Kim K). Able to influence millions with one word, the virus makes her it's host body. It's the year 2024. A man (Tom Hanks) stuck on an island for the last 20 years creates a raft and lands on a desolate shore. He finds a world where everyone has become mindless drones. Since his presence is nowhere on the Internet, he is able to walk the world like a ghost. Eventually he runs into a group of people like himself. People from lost tribes in the Amazon. They take him to their leader, the scientist who first discovered the virus. He now has a cure for the virus but it needs to come in contact with the host body. Only one man, a survivor, a ghost, can handle the mission.twist ending. Morgan Freeman's ""cure"" gives him complete control over everyone. He becomes God. There will also be a rap battle between Kanye and T.Hanks. to set up the suspense, we'll a flashback of a young T.Hanks (played by Chet Hanks) vs a young Kanye in his prime.

Think of the most memorable actors, John Wayne, Katherine Hepburn, Kirk Douglas, Bogart, Eastwood, Heston, Clark Gable, etc. etc. When you think about it, the ones who really stick in our cultural memory tend to be the ones who find that one solid character and stick with it.

d7xqbni,USeaMoose,"I think the reality is that many of her fans will just not admit to liking her. Or they are not vocal about it.I too only hear about her on Reddit, and it is always negative. The only positive press I can remember was that picture of her lubed butt. Which I'm clearly in the minority for thinking it was not even remotely arousing.But aside from that, the kind of attention she gets here is really not the sort that can be spun into wealth. Redditors don't post about how vapid she is, and then go home to watch her reality show. Unless the majority here is dramatically different form me, they don't love to hate her, they just hate her.I really don't think it is us keeping her alive. She needs people who are interested in her life, people who tune in to her show, who buy whatever various products she slaps her name on. Maybe negative posts here keep her name on some people's minds, but I don't think it does her much good any more.Besides, that war has already been fought and lost. She is wealthy beyond reason, and is married to someone that Reddit actually does love to hate."

d7xqxsy,AnotherDrZoidberg,"She obviously has actual fans who keep her popular, but the Reddit negativity and constant talk and posts about her just make it worse. Even if it's negative. She's a tabloid celebrity that has survived off of media attention because people consume her. Stop talking about her, stop bringing her up all the time and you weaken her. If you truly don't like her and want her to cease being a celebrity, stop adding to her celebrity by hating on her. Just ignore her."
d7xselk,USeaMoose,"Well, personally I do not talk about her at all. I doubt you could find mention of her name in my comment history. I'd surprised if it shows up on more than one or two threads I've commented on, including this one.I guess with me it is more of an indifference. I assume my feelings match those of the average Redditor, but I guess there is plenty of evidence that there are those here who do actually love to hate her. Who get giddy when they see a negative post about her and rush to share it on Reddit. The problem is that those are exactly the people you can't talk into ignoring her to make her go away. Because they genuinely do love to hate her. They want her to stay in the spotlight as a villain.The ones who agree with you, who actually dislike her name showing up on their radars at all, don't really need to be told to ignore her to make her go away. But it can be hard to tell the difference. Those who love to hate her will admit to nothing but hating her.She is fading away anyways. 5 years ago I'd hear about her show at least once a month. I have not heard about it for a long time now. So far as I know it was canceled when she had a kid. Her star is fading, and I feel like when it gets dim enough Kanye will lose interest. Not that I think their relationship was ever more than publicity for either of them. Her next big moment in the spotlight will be their divorce. I don't know what else she could possibly do."
d7xp8rt,fajardo99,"but reddit itself thrives off of hate; they feed in it.

d7y8mdr,ArtemisArchFiend,I think you just wrote a new southpark episode
d7yaii2,coatrack68,Well...10% Agent fee to whoever can make that happen...
d7ybc8d,ArtemisArchFiend,If you tag them on twitter the creators are very likely to at least give you a mention on it
d7ydt2c,coatrack68,Thanks...I might just do that...
d7y8ne5,Dr_Freedman,I would totally watch this
d7y6bim,zookszooks,Would you accept a 'Q' of -71 for millions of dollars? I would.
d7xw70l,mattwb72,Not sure how useful that Q score is then. For some inexplicable reason people like Kardashian enough that she is making loads of $$. How about a measurement relating the amount of annual income to the celebrities talent.
d7xx3wm,Spartan1997,"Ah, I see you've noticed talent, money, and popularity have nothing to do with each other. As long as you're not zero you're relevant."
d7y647h,johnnydanja,"You don't have to be well liked to make lots of money, in fact it's probably generally the opposite."
d7yhjjg,elconquistador1985,People like watching train wrecks.
d7y2si5,Disproves,"I don't like Kim Kardashian but come on, Tom Green exists."
d7y8krm,PoopyDoopie,"The only stories I've heard about Tom Green are that he showed up to accept a Golden Raspberry award with his own red carpet that he rolled out and then walked down, and that he paid a fine or bail or something for somebody who was arrested for not returning a Freddy Got Fingered VHS tape. He sounds hilarious."
d7y5skn,LowVolt,Daddy would you like some sausage?
d7y7j2n,Chief_Givesnofucks,Best movie ever at an (8)
d7yniem,evoLverR,What? Tom Green is absolutely awesome!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p_x9IN6894
d7yz1ww,Disproves,I apologize for your brain damage.
d7z0da5,evoLverR,So do I for your sadly deceased joie de vivre :)
d7z17re,Disproves,"Because not liking Dane Cook level comedy means you don't enjoy life. Sorry, that was rude to Dane Cook."
d7z1u89,evoLverR,"I don't particularly enjaoy Dane Cook, or rather - not at all. However, I really love Monty Python and the whole theatre of absurd idea, which is what Tom Green also tried to encapsulate in his work.What can I say. Don't take shit too seriously? You'll have much more fun like that, I promise."
d7z26dc,Disproves,"I wasn't aware I was taking anything seriously. Ironically you'd have to be taking this seriously to assume I am without context. And no, Tom Green is not like Monty Python. His humour is just based on spazing out like Dane Cook."
d7z2fgx,evoLverR,"Whatever man. I gave you a perfect example of why I think he's funny in the video I linked in my first comment. If you don't understand why that IS fucking hillarious, we sadly have no business discussing humor. Simple as that.Good day to you."
d7z2w4n,Disproves,"You linked to a clip from Freddy Got Fingered, I saw that when I was 12 and couldn't stand it. Maybe the clip was funny, I don't know. Tom Green has the potential to be funny, such as his cameo on Clone High where he basically mocked himself. However, jumping around and saying ""look at me, I'm so funny"" doesn't tend to be funny. Tom Green is the only stain on Canada greater than Justin Bieber and less than Stephen Harper."
d7zbh8k,evoLverR,"Yeah, I see you seem to have embedded this point deep into your core :)"
d7zf2o6,Disproves,Which point...? I said like 5 things.
d7xpo72,wandrewj,"Sad thing is, they probably get paid about the same for all the attention..."
d7xz619,,Where does Chet Haze rank?
d7y5zer,WienerJungle,There's 2 actors I've never once heard anyone say they don't like and thanks Tom Hanks and John Goodman.
d7y7fot,Gooch_Scoop,"Looks like I'm first. I don't care for Tom Hanks. While I've enjoyed some of his performances, I thought his interpretation of Robert Langdon not only torpedoed the Da Vinci Code series, but his hair was so bad it soured my image of him to this day."
d7y7kls,WienerJungle,I don't mean his movies or acting so much. Just not liking him as a person.
d7y7r11,Gooch_Scoop,"In that case I will backtrack. He seems like a pleasant, down to earth dude."
d7y6le1,explodingbarrels,This is an old article
d7yb3ef,BiancaMinola,Fun fact: Television reporters also receive Q-scores and their salary and future in reporting is often tied to those numbers.
d7yhrpk,Lord_Bisquick,"Would love to see some historical examples. Hedy Lamar, Clark Gable, Sinatra..."
d7yo3lj,swingerofbirch,Makes me wonder how profitable a micro-transaction game featuring Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman would be.
d7ypdhg,baytor,Leave it to Hollywood to remove the I out of the IQ.
d7yyplg,screenwriterjohn,"It is a marketing tool. Production companies don't care how likable you are if you're, yes, winning."
d7y0tj6,Manumitany,What is Q's Q score?
d7yd3wx,Termiinal,Schoolboy? Or another Q I dont know about
d7yda46,Manumitany,Star Trek
d7y3ndo,,It's 0 cause nobody gives a flying fuck
d7y3ydh,Manumitany,edgy afso impressed by you
d7y4ir8,cheeze_n_potatoes,Am impressed. Wow.
d7ymlyt,,"Congrats, if you do care you're an idiot"
d7y5crz,TheChanceWhoSaysNi,The Kardashians have the lowest Q's and also IQ's
d7xu3qg,JustHach,"> Bieber's negative rating, Schafer says, doesn't stem from any kind of ironic ""negative"" admirationWhat the fuck is 'ironic ""negative"" admiration'?"
d7xutqm,aallqqppzzmm,"I would think it's things like sharknado, where it's so awful that people cant get enough of it, even as they acknowledge how awful it is."
d7xyo7v,zagreus9,"I still don't get the love for Sharknado. Good bad films are alazing, but those films were really surprisingly dull"
d7y3lzp,,They 'cant get enough of it' because that's what's popular. If this movie was barely known those same people wouldn't even speak of it
d7y12f6,jamesbondq,"Copying part of my comment someplace else: It matters how you embrace /market this score. Kim Kardashian embraces the vain, ignorant, rich girl image, and that's good for her because she's in the market of being a totem of celebrity obsessed culture."
d7ycjzb,rocketkielbasa,tom hanks is a piece of shit. In 1997 he broke into my house and killed my cat
d7ymnvd,MuhPhoneAccount,He's not a smart man.
d7yod0b,skineechef,Nobody liked that cat.
d7y4g87,nayhem_jr,"> The highest negative â€¦*NO*, IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY!"
d7y5ivn,tadpoleloop,"I have a PhD in mathematics and I have no quarrels with the language. You can consider the real line as a 1D vector space, and the property they are trying to describe is a vector with the largest magnitude pointing in the negative direction. I get why you don't like the sentence, but I think it is fine."
d7y6n7q,wholligan,"They are also saying a ""increase"" in the negative score. That means less negative, not more negative the way they are saying it. I was very confused."
d7ypckt,Roddoman,"But it does have the highest negative score. Lowest score, but highest negative."
d7y3jl7,,Titus already covered this....http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ww64nm/stand-up-christopher-titus--uncensored---douchebag-credits
d7xspwn,sillyandstrange,Coincidentally she has an IQ of - 71 also.
d7y3jqz,,"Embracing the hate from millions of dumb fucks all over the world and getting tons of cash for it, I'd say she's pretty smart"
d7y5gi5,sillyandstrange,"I think that was more of her parents, she wouldn't have had that popularity to begin with without them. Also stupid leading stupid isn't uncommon"
d7y6yav,Ghidoran,So what is your evidence that she is unintelligent?
d7y6y70,ElMangosto,Her first appearances on camera were as Paris Hilton's personal assistant. Then she made a porn with a c-list rap star. I don't think her parents had too much to do with either of those things.
d7y8phq,sillyandstrange,"Both of them were already famous, then her mother went on to marry an Olympic gold medalist. Yeah Paris and porn gave her air time, but I'm saying she wouldn't have had half a chance without that family fame."
d7xovfg,Aelinsaar,So much noise for so little signal...
d7xz4k4,SooFlyyy,"To be fair, KK is the type that you would love to hate."
d7y0ztz,strange-brew,"At what point does a negative score actually do anything to them? I mean, The Kadashian's are still considered ""Celebrities""..even if they are only famous for being famous."
d7y386b,ManyJoeys,"Is not the Q a measure of the % of people familiar with the artist, while there is a second number that measures approval?"
d7y3xch,,I don't know why you'd put the effort into *hating* the Kardashians.
d7y44bh,poohster33,What's Andy Dick's score?
d7y5abi,AlphakirA,"0, no one cares about his existence either way."
d7y4gfq,pixie_led,I still don't understand if people love or hate Maggie Smith. Terrible confusingly written article.
d7y683d,zehgess,I think the magnitude of the score is more important to the celebrity.
d7y6xgd,Syntechi,I love me some Morgan Freeman
d7y7hyh,orojinn,And Keeping Up with the Kardashians is still on. /s
d7y8a76,TheBIGbadTOE,I wonder what Kit Duncan got scored
d7y8gvv,avocadoblain,"Someday I hope someone writes a really good book about Tom Hanks. Like on the level of Caro's books about LBJ. LBJ was an asshole and Tom Hanks is by all accounts, not an asshole. I would just love to see the behind the scenes of what it's like to be such a successful actor, and on top of that, the most liked celebrity in America."
d7y8ir3,heyjohnnyjohnny,"Q is for quotient or the result of one number divided by another as you remember from math class. In this case, it is probably the number of people who like her/ divided by the number of people who want to stab her and Kanye in the eye with a steak knife."
d7y94yz,rathemighty,[Reminds me of something...](http://new3.fjcdn.com/pictures/Billys+test+scores+2x+4+a+clown+with+a+flamethrower+plus_453d67_4891111.jpg)
d7y96p4,Supersnazz,Is likeability correlated with popularity and/or bankability? Some people enjoy watching people they hate. People like Kim Kardashian are effectively professional hate sponges. Their job is to absorb the public's hatred for entitled airhead celebrities.
d7y9hpf,mauxly,Tina Fey must rock her Q score.
d7y9ped,DanielJMurillo,Celebrities are just a tool of oppression.
d7ya4il,blacklite911,So basically these scores don't mean a thing because some of these low Q score celebs are making a hell of a lot of money from their popularity.
d7ybmz3,Swellswill,"Tm Cruise doesn't seem all that likable in interviews, but he's a good actor and has a knack for making good movies. George Clooney comes off as personable and good humored in his interviews, but some of his movies go splat all over the screen. The Q factor exists, but it's not the most decisive one in an actor's career."
d7yccs5,cyterrin,I deserve that down vote for being so out of the loop. My bad.
d7yd6c3,ap117,Morgan Freeman pretty much plays the same character in every movie...with or without a wig.
d7ydkck,GentleThug,This is obscured though Kim Kardashian is very wealthy and it's not because everyone hates her so much they just pay her money. If that were a real thing Nickelback would be headlining shows and getting boo'd through their performance. These types of ratings mean nothing really.
d7yfwxz,readallthebook,Lowest IQ score too.
d7yga2l,splein23,I'm surprised that Tom Hanks scored as high a Morgan Freeman. I figured Morgan would be in a league of his own.
d7ygp8v,flankingorbit,Totally misread this and was briefly very happy that Morgan Fairchild's popularity had not waned.
d7ygwqm,bicode,So Kim Kardashian has the lowest Q and the lowest IQ.What a catch she is!
d7yhhe1,mitso6989,"Kim is still all over media and TV. What's my score -10,000."
d7yhn4x,b_sinning,Glad to see Grande so high on the list. She's cute but awful
d7yi679,chambertlo,"Kim K. is supposedly this disliked, yet she has millions of followers and makes millions of dollars for doing absolutely nothing. So, the true secret to success is to be as disliked as humanly possible? Got it."
d7yif3q,rustyleftnut,"Can you imagine being almost 50% more disliked than Tom Hanks is liked?I'd say Kim Kardashian is probably very saddened by that, but we all know she's her biggest fan and has no idea that people tend to not like her."
d7yiu8i,Tyranid457,Interesting!
d7yixgt,Entity17,IQ score too?
d7yj0x1,See_that_thing,now lets try the I.Q tests and see who scores the most
d7yjgpd,willsherm28,Now I want to see an erotic thriller with Morgan Freeman and Kim Kardashian getting dirty in the bedroom
d7yjin5,catsnlacquer,The thumbnail shows Ariana Grande. I like her less than I like Kim K.
d7yk1k2,-Bk7,Is there an on-line listing of Q scores?
d7ykldv,faithle55,All the people who watch the Kardashian TV stuff hate her?I find that difficult to believe.
d7yl88p,Sir_Doughnut,I still like her.
d7ymf3z,,"The most respected men are the ones who behave well, conduct themselves like total gents, do not get involved in ''causes'' and do a fantastic job. Wow, class pays!"
d7ymki5,Deked,"Wait, if Kim Kardashian is a ""-71"" then what's Kanye West, like - googolplex?"
d7ymprz,Op5MmmCheese,"Weird coincidence, that exactly matches her iq score"
d7yms4k,ThatZBear,It probably matches her *I*Q pretty closely as well.
d7ynm73,luckycommander,Only regarding the examples in the title you'd say that Q score is positively correlated with IQ score
d7ynwis,tarzan322,They really need to cancel every show on MTV and that channel with the Kardashian's on it.
d7yoggr,lifes_paragon,Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman? I would think Bill Murray would lead this with the highest score.
d7yz8nn,Wurstgewitter,"Bill Murray is always at 100 points, every other celeb is just measured in relation to Mr Murray"
d7yozwk,DeeDeeInDC,Qool story bro
d7yp45a,Hippydippy420,"Hate fame is more lucrative than any other fame out there....haters gon' hate, meanwhile Kimmy's makin **bank**."
d7yplo2,Leonard_Church814,Seems reasonable.
d7yr38u,thisimpetus,TIL: being obnoxious and self-involved is more contemptable than being a serial rapist to many Americans.
d7ytibh,Sophiar13,this is funny to me because I don't follow celebrities whatsoever and yet I hear people raving about Miss Kardashian almost every day. I think whoever is answering these surveys is in denial
d7ytvnt,acobrien85,So why this picture?
d7ywr7o,fashizzIe,">""Highest negative Q score""Why do they say this? Can't they just say ""the lowest Q score""?"
d7yxnzu,Dacelonid,"When I first read the title, I read it as Kim Kardashian was determined to have the lowest IQ score with -71"
d7yz4po,Benedikto_,Yet she is a millionaire
d7z8jan,cshell5,Well....people love to hate Kim Kardashian so much...may be that's why she is famous even today
d8eejnr,,Miley looks like a crazy person in her picture-it's her eyes.
d7y4hyo,Blackstone01,"Poor scale, lowest value should be 0."
d7y6prn,,"Is Kanye on there? And if so, what is his score? I'm betting it's pretty low."
d7y92m2,piso_mojado,It's probably pretty neutral despite what reddit thinks of him.
d7ygygo,TebowsLawyer,"""Everybody feel a way about K but at least ya'll feel something"""
d7yp23t,,Huh???? Oh it must be one of his oh-so-genius lyrics.
d7xx8pi,BMikasa,I feel like Chris Pratt is probably a 47. Anybody else have guesses for others?
d7y0486,MidEastBeast777,Does it count as learning if its an incredibly useless and vapid fact?
d7y7nix,FiDiy,Trump is -45
d7y83ry,Theres_A_FAP_4_That,"I don't like Tom hanks, he seems fake. I'm usually right about these things."
d7ycm43,I_Think_IShit_Myself,That's funny.. her Q score is the same as her IQ..
d7ydfl9,PrsnSingh,Well duh. Kim has no talent at all.
d7yekyo,SmallManBigMouth,I love Ariana Grande. Shes so talented and and adorable and Ive said too much....
d7xuixv,IAmAtomato,If you switched Q scores with IQ scores it would probably have similar results.
d7y7n5c,,I really am not a fan of Morgan Freeman.There.I said it.
d7xov1g,crazy-carebear,I can't believe Kardashians score was that high. We have to do something about this.
d7xyvgm,boomforeal,The Kardashians really are the Trumps of the entertainment world. Except maybe for the Trumps.
d7y51ze,clickclickclik,dont compare kardashians to trump
d7y0cf2,YoBGS,"But what about Tim Honks? I mean, that dude was a Wheel of Fortune answer..."
d7ya0d5,eddiejugs,My question is who are the people who like the kardas.... and what is their reasoning? Seriously.
d7yam1d,fellatious_argument,Its sad that Adrian Peterson is higher than anyone that isn't a rapist or murderer.
d7yaocw,WildGalaxy,"Man, I initially misread that as Bollywood and was confused when the article didn't mention any Indian actors at all."
d7ybjcu,jackmonte,"regardless of what you say about her, Kim still has a high score with my D ;)"
d7ydq5k,obeytrafficlights,only -71? Im surprised Kim scored so well.
d7yheej,yankerage,And yet you cannot escape the Kardashians it seems. It's like if Jersey shore were a family.
d7yn29k,,.
d7yos20,Turd_City_Auto_Group,Wow. Just one more /r/celebrities fact not to give a shit about. People actually give a shit about this? Fucking pathetic.
d7yrkxy,refuseaccount80,You are here commenting on it
d7xpklb,outrider567,Kardashian should be minus infinity---Kanye ain't gonna like this
d7y4h43,upboatugboat,Now that I think about it I hate Kim Kardashian almost twice as much as I love Morgan Freeman.
d7y69pl,forbiddenway,Ariana grande better have a friggin low score
d7yakhj,GETURHANDOFFMYPENIS,"Meh, I still want to eat her tight little fuck holes."
d7y6wse,RaubMagre,"I guess the Q scores need to be revamped, because plenty of millions of people love Kim K."
d7xyehu,aykevin,Clearly it's not true when beiber and kardashians are so popular
d7y061b,GazelleShaft,"Popularity and likeability aren't the same... ""Haters make me famous."" -Snooki"
d7y7cb5,Zakatikus,Case in point - Trump
d7xoos9,LordBrandon,That shows a problem with the Q scores. Kardasian obviously has people interested in her. Moreso than morgan freeman. There should be some sort of high/low system for polarizing people.
d7xu6wr,onioning,"It's not ""interested in."" It's about how liked they are.I'd imagine that a zero score is the worst case."
d7xuqcf,LordBrandon,"Maybe it should be interested, since you can obviously make a famous person out of someone unlikable."
d7xuuzw,onioning,That's just a different metric. It's not what they're trying to measure.
d7xmx9r,rootbeertoker,Stupid picture that has nothing to do with the title. OP do you think that is Kim Kardashian?
d7xoh3r,Dunkh,"You realize that OP has no control over what is displayed, right? Arianna Grande is the first picture in the article. Reddit goes off that."
d7xxzop,WorldsGreatestPoop,"I've never heard her music, or seen an interview of her, and while I'm sure she's awful, I think she's the hottest trashy celebrity around."
d7y6okd,PM_ME_OBESE_TITS,She's actually a pretty good artist.
d7xn0rv,PumpingFeFe,You didn't even click the link did you...
d7yens4,SmallManBigMouth,What? Waste time reading when they coukd cut straight to bitching? What if someone starts bitching first?! Then where will life's meaning come from?

d7xozz5,Shuko,"Welcome to the wide world of Reddit Linking, where the algorithm that chooses the thumbnail is made up, and what OP wants (or even what makes the most sense) doesn't matter!Before you criticize someone who didn't even have a say in what you're griping about, it might behoove you to learn a little bit about Reddit first. In other words, lurk moar."
