dwnclzd,laadeehoopdaa,How do I know it wasn't you trying to look better than everyone else by hating on something you created for the sole purpose of hating on....
dwncrn3,bmlzootown,Because that's too much work? You've greatly underestimated my level of laziness.
dwnctpm,laadeehoopdaa,You're underestimating my level of sleep deprivation. Lol I was just being dumb because it made me laugh.

dwmonau,Bodchubbz,Fact: School shootings have increased since Justin Bieber became popular

dwmf36y,theDFAJ,r/unexpectedmulaney
dwmfzhk,bdonvr,I mean someone mentioned repeatedly playing “What's new pussycat” repeatedly so I dunno how unexpected that really was.
dwmk2aa,ReaverBBQ,I only learned about this sub today and I've already seen it mentioned 3 times since then

dwmwp4g,SwampOfDownvotes,I thought the point was to pay to get the music to stop. This would make 0 money.

dwmisu5,Whtwudtristando,"And they would all think: ""Either what's new pussycat is a lot longer than I remember, or somebody is playing what's new pussycat for a second time."""
dwmizlf,SynisterSilence,That joke reminds me of a similar story: Some local radio station here in the US was celebrating The Beatles for an anniversary or something like that and told their listeners “The 100th caller gets to pick their favorite Beatles song and we'll be playing it *all* *day* *long*.” ... The caller chose [Hey Bulldog](https://youtu.be/supgJbYUrLY). Imagine that same intro piano riff starting every four minutes all day. You know the DJ was thinking “We've made a mistake so bad.” around the ninth play.“*Standing in the rain...*”

dwnc9qm,Krammmm,Why am I imagining it being played but with Bob pinciotti as the singer.
dwnjarx,RilynnRae,r/unexpectedmulaney
dwmgn0y,TheOneGuyWhoDosent,Jim Gaffigan
dwme2gf,laetus,I hope the school now gets sued for illegally playing the song in a public place.
dwmfo0m,joevsyou,"And ""charging"" for it without a license?"
dwmfxxh,Snowghost11,The charged for not playing it.
dwmh41q,Rolled1YouDeadNow,Wondered if that's in the copyright laws
dwmjb95,laadeehoopdaa,"I really wanna know, but I'm too lazy to google it."
dwmk87l,SuperFLEB,You're violating a copyright the moment you broadcast it without licensing it. What you charge money for after that is immaterial.
dwmkfm5,kentarospin98,What if it's a CC type thing. Some of those licences allow non commercial use. Including broadcasting in public places.
dwmnfu6,DontPressAltF4,"You won't find those licenses on pop songs, bro."
dwmnjh6,FirstWiseWarrior,"Ha, anybody playing any song slightly louder can be considered broadcasting it...nope, that's not gonna happen"
dwmnuay,SuperFLEB,"I was just saying ""broadcast"" in the general sense of playing it out to a number of people, not in the sense of radio broadcast (though I suppose it would be similar if you're sending it out to a bunch of different speakers throughout the building). Anyhow, it's similar to playing music in a bar or a store. You've got to be licensed to do that, since it's a public performance."
dwmqp1n,laadeehoopdaa,"A bar I used to work for owes like $10,000 because they use pandora hooked up through an aux cable."
dwn4kfa,zanenight,Pandora offeres a business subscription https://pandora.moodmedia.com/licensing
dwn4qkm,laadeehoopdaa,"Like I said, used to work for. I'm not sure how much longer it'll be a business anyway."
dwmrohu,xsilver911,I remember those DVD's that had the warning at the front that specifically said this dvd is not for broadcast which INCLUDESplayback in prisons/schools/retirement homes etc.Its basically considered broadcast if you have a gathering of people that is organized.Its the same principle where blockbuster or any media libary doesnt just pay retail for a dvd/cd and then charge to rent it out.They pay for a license to rent it out - which costs 10x more at least I think.
dwmsnu2,FirstWiseWarrior,Welp no Bar or Store in my country ever get licensed to do that. If if they get charged couldn't they just say they played it loud but for themself?
dwn4022,1darklight1,"They could definitely try to say that, but the judge probably wouldn't believe them"
dwmk7o1,ShadowLiberal,"They still made money off of it, so I doubt that the law would care if they didn't purchase a license to play it first."
dwmh015,audible_narrator,Hahaha. I can see ASCAP and BMI sending letters now.
dwmms9d,4point5billion45,Sued for creating a hostile learning environment?
dwmnmcq,PM_me_insights,"Nah, extortion is a fair use."
dwmkm72,PunkorTrendy,Pretty sure that schools get a fair use exception
dwmfqx0,SuperSocrates,The students organized this themselves but okay.
dwmgg5s,Alar44,It's still technically illegal.
dwmpvbx,Joe_Bruin,"Is it? Where'd you go to law school?What laws, specifically, was this violating?Armchair attorneys are the worst."
dwmqj4j,Alar44,"I'm a musician, so quite familiar with how this shit works. Copyright infringement. They were using it to raise money too which is a big no-no.https://www.ascap.com/help/ascap-licensingPeople who can't google are the worst."
dwrybk3,Joe_Bruin,"Sorry, as an attorney let me repeat the question in case your eyes weren't working properly. You linked to an organization, not to any statute. >Where'd you go to law school?>What laws, specifically, was this violating?Please, tell me where you went to law school and what specific provisions this is violating. Being a musician does not mean you understand the law at all lmao. Come on, that's just pathetic."
dwmf1z0,LexLol,That week the students learned how ~~extortion~~ torture works.
dwmifp1,Kildigs,"Seriously, we did[ a very similar thing](https://mic.com/articles/87851/11-popular-songs-the-cia-used-to-torture-prisoners-in-the-war-on-terror#.uVzS47mBm) to accused terrorists in gitmo."

dwmivm8,xKawo,Next week the school knows how to trigger a schoolshooting... I legit would call in sick if I had to hear that or go riot
dwmh1lb,AlvinTaco,The Chicago way.
dwmcn1a,XxCLEMENTxX,Isn't it blackmail when there's money involved?
dwmcw7p,TheRecognized,"It's extortion when there's money involved, it's blackmail when there's kompromat involved."
dwme0sx,hezdokwow,Isn't kompromot a Pokemon?
dwmg5va,RVAndal,[Digimon*](https://i.imgur.com/UM8mLE5.jpg)
dwmgere,Starved-Nutritionist,Isn't Digimon a digital Mongolian?
dwmi4u3,7mm-08,That's actually considered offensive. They prefer to be called E-mongols.
dwml2jq,060789,"10 years ago maybe. Now the accepted term is ""Mongols of Digital"""

dwmok3u,SamuraiJono,Krokodilopolis
dwmdkxd,Dead-phoenix,"I dont think money makes a difference, blackmail is a form of extortion where information is used to get usually money or something out of someone rather then just doing anything bad."
dwmdlu5,TheRecognized,"Yeah, so if you wanted to extort some money from someone you would blackmail them with kompromat. Got about half way there.Edit: Kompromat with an “a” apparently."
dwmdp7z,Dead-phoenix,"You know thats the first time i heard about the term kompromot, had to google it lol"
dwmdqjh,TheRecognized,"Convenient word right? Cool thing about English that we don't do enough of anymore, just steal a word from another language."
dwmg50b,adwarkk,It's funny if you think that English is anyhow special in those terms :P
dwme3zk,Dead-phoenix,Yeah absolutely!
dwme0q9,Equolizer,Do you mean [Kompromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat)?
dwmdcnz,DefiantLemur,How do normal adults not know they could get a law suit this way. They might win in court but that's a loss of money they need.
dwmf8su,,[deleted]
dwmfql7,YouAreWrongBot,"Would they be prosecuted? No. It's silly to say a lawsuit would happen.But for the same reason I can't play music really loudly and tell the people in the apartment below mine to pay me to stop it. School officials would absolutely get involved and if there was a complaint, they would have to return the money. But nobody is going to file a suit over music in school.Annoying people with music or noise is one thing. Having them pay you to stop, and then coming back the next day and rinse/repeating the process, is another."
dwmfta5,Sloppy1sts,It's not the annoyance part that's a crime. It's the demanding of money in order to stop being annoying.
dwmfhhy,DrKillingsworth,"Maybe not in short term, but I could see someone suing the school for a failure of a grade attributed to annoying, unwarranted music. And perhaps being successful..."
dwmfioz,iwasyourbestfriend,"In between classes? Shut up,"
dwmfm3g,,[deleted]
dwmfo87,nofrkinideawhoiam,Why do you have to be such a dick?
dwmfsn5,HoratioMG,"lol why are you so defensive about this? You're embarrassing yourself, grow up."
dwmga2z,DrKillingsworth,"Yes, well, how's about a real, successful case for ya:http://komonews.com/news/local/seattle-family-may-lose-house-over-barking-dog-11-21-2015"
dwmgwk7,xTELOx,"That case was won because the other side didn't show up to court, not on the merits of their argument."
dwmh6ml,DrKillingsworth,"Yes, but the point is that these cases exist. And, what's more, they're successful. This is just the tip of the iceberg of the American legal system."
dwmhkfm,xTELOx,"You're missing the point. It's a frivolous lawsuit; another lawyer says so right there in the article. This case wasn't successful based on merits they brought to court. They won because the other side didn't show up to the court date and lost by default. People being in frivolous lawsuits all the time on noise complaints. Just because this one won, doesn't make it relevant to the school situation."
dwmi0qs,DrKillingsworth,"No I'm not; you're arguing something completely different. The superficiality of the lawsuit here is exactly the case. Backtrack through the comment chain; someone DID sue for a dog bark (unwarranted music). And they did win, regardless of strategy. There are multiple ways to solve a math problem."
dwmg278,ThePancakeChair,Is that next to the laundromat?
dwmdspp,XxCLEMENTxX,"I see, thanks for the explaination. English isn't my first language :)"
dwmduvf,TheRecognized,"Hey no worries, kompromot is even a Russian word as well, English can be a tricky bitch of a language."
dwmhiqz,HappyCakeDaySexy,"Happy cake day, sexy"
dwn7903,TheRecognized,You too.
dwmdd0o,LeoBravo,"It's extortion when you threaten to do something bad if they don't pay you, it's blackmail when you threaten to tell the world about something bad they did unless they pay you"
dwmduqw,XxCLEMENTxX,"I see, thanks! English isn't my first language, so I was honestly just wondering if I had my understanding wrong. Clearly I did!"
dwmhfa9,djb007_96,English is my first language and I didn't quite understand the difference so don't feel bad.
dwmjkiq,Payed_Looser,"If you don't gild me, I will tell the world you don't know how blackmail works"
dwmzdoc,djb007_96,I think I already told the world.
dwmhj0g,quickclickz,The amount of twitter followers that bieber would destroy that argument
dwmcuks,Dead-phoenix,Blackmail is a form of extortion.
dwmdqcj,knowssleep,I never understood blackmail. What is to stop them from releasing the information once you pay them? You are putting a lot of trust in someone who obviously has no sense of honour.
dwmerr0,AUserNeedsAName,"The real question is what's to stop them coming back and demanding more from you later. If they release the info, they instantly lose their leverage."
dwmjutw,Spearsy23,"That's why the usual strategy, assuming it's nothing that's going to end your career, is to go public before they have the chance to."
dwmv9i4,carpedieeznuts,"They lose nothing, you lose everything (credibility, honor, trust)."
dwmx86s,Dead-phoenix,Isnt blackmailing illegal in some countries? As long as you know your blackmailer and can prove it they can lose everything to.
dwmya5d,Warpimp,But that normally involves being culpable for what they are blackmailing you for.
dwmew5s,MySuperLove,"If you plan to blackmail others in the future, you'll have a better chance of getting paid if you hold up your end of the deal the first time"
dwmfhc4,ihaveb4lls,"Why, is there a blackmailer's Angieslist, where I can check reviews on my blackmailer to make sure he's a standup guy?"
dwmrz5s,greenwizardneedsfood,“He was a great blackmailer. So polite. Clearly a professional just trying to do his job. Would recommend getting blackmailed by him. 4.5 stars.”
dwmhzo1,Necronom1tr0n,Real mobsters use extensively indexed Rolodexes which are read over the phone to inquiring allies
dwmdzl8,Dead-phoenix,Pretty much. I suppose if your desperate to not get the information released enough you'll do anything.
dwmf5tx,SnickycrowJayC,Imagine blackmailing someone and your information is that they murdered someone in cold blood. I would not want to blackmail that person in person.
dwmf2l9,Storm137,As a victim of blackmail - it's all about control. If you hold that information your puppet dances.And boy did I dance when I wanted my abuser to keep quiet and to stop threatening me.
dwmh16s,leemon3321,What information did your blackmailer have on you?I want to know for reasons
dwmijp4,aetheradept,I'll tell you but you gotta pay first
dwmgt1w,inspire_thefuture,Care to share?
dwmfyii,longtimegoneMTGO,"> I never understood blackmail. What is to stop them from releasing the information once you pay them?Not much, which is why you shouldn't really think of blackmail as a one time thing. It's more an ongoing issue, the blackmailer has to figure out the sweet spot. Clearly, they don't want the information out there, so if they paid you at all, they would probably be willing to pay you again later. At the same time, if you demand too much, or demand too often, at some point it's just going to be cheaper to pay someone to kill you."
dwmiul5,Olivia512,Can you get them to sign an NDA as an extra deterrence? So if they release the info they now have an extra civil charge on top of the criminal blackmail charge (which might be hard to prove if they blackmailed face-to-face instead of traceable communications).
dwmkcsr,SuperFLEB,"I don't believe there are criminal charges involved in violating an NDA. You'd (at best) just get to sue for damages or whatever the NDA set out as a penalty, (assuming that penalty was reasonable)."
dwnbp5a,Gatonom,"Blackmail is generally ""If you don't -do- X, I'll reveal this."", often X is something that creates more blackmail.With money there is that they can get it back and charge you with blackmailing if you reveal it."
dwmj9yx,MalWareInUrTripe,"Breaking your face into 2 pieces is the next move, sonny boy.."
dwmggs2,Tianoccio,"In my town, the students would have sued. Like literally they would have sued."
dwmn06t,DearyDairy,"As they should, students shouldn't have to pay additional money to have their school foster a learning environment, that should be included in tuition.It's also incredibly disrespectful to students with disabilities like autism, SPD, APD, migraine disorder, etc to play stimulating pop music through the halls and ask them to pay to make it stop.If I told my dad I need money to make the Beiber induced headaches go away so I could actually focus in maths class, my dad would have sued the school to avoid giving me a dime."
dwms00g,Tianoccio,"Oh yeah, there's no way this goes more than a day without the ACLU running through the schools black ink, with a week we'd have been on national news. At least, where I live."
dwmhmj8,_var_log_messages,Its Chicago they already know what extortion is
dwmccbd,Cyberus01,Let's start a rico investigation
dwmgy92,Lokitbc,We live in Chicago. Everyday is a lesson in extortion. Still love it though...
dwmi894,surprise_b1tch,"Yeah, they tried this at my school. They played Mm Bop during lunchtime. It lasted one day until all the students complained that it was extortion and torture, and also infringing on students' free time at lunch. Parents were not happy, either. Good lesson about shitty fundraising tactics, though."
dwmj1w8,3-7-77,Living in Chicago I can almost guarantee they knew it already.

dwn3i2i,CommandoDude,Next week the school learns how revolution works.
dwn79w0,bluerose1197,"My husband's school does this with ""What does the Fox say"" at the loudest the speakers will go. I was unfortunate enough to have to visit his school during donation week a couple years ago. It was so loud in the halls that you couldn't hear anyone speak."
dwmjoum,imsofacinated,>how extortion workThe Chicago way.
dwm9obq,Schmuckey,My high school did the same thing but with “mmm bop” by Hanson for like 2 weeks until they got a certain amount of money. This was back in 2009. They stopped when someone wrote an anonymous note stating if they heard the song one more time that they would commit suicide. Edit: I went to Desert Vista in Arizona. It seems a large amount of schools across the county conspired in these extortion tactics. Probably something that was on MySpace. Go Thunder!
dwmamn3,Funkyldj,"Man, if they did play the song again and that kid actually killed himself, that'd be one hell of a message for him to send."

dwmfrrl,tayntslap,With a noose made of play dough
dwmfs8v,lusvig,Hahahaha smh
dwmib2i,rifenbug,That is a pretty effective method so long as you have rope around your neck.
dwmfcd6,Takabletoast,That'd be the perfect opportunity to commit a murder and then frame it to look like a suicide. Hypothetically.
dwmku62,yhack,This guy kills
dwmve75,carpedieeznuts,Yas
dwmbpv6,Jay-Hobo,Do you think they would've donated the money to suicide prevention instead?
dwmf483,pinniped1,"No, just buy shorter chairs."
dwmi0xx,Necronom1tr0n,Suicide is murder. Murder is against the rules. All chairs banned
dwmlxw7,jhartwell,">Suicide is murder I think you mean that suicide is painless, it brings on many changes...like changing from chairs to beanbags."
dwmmj08,Necronom1tr0n,Beanbags symbolize the lazy and semi-recumbant state which our school system is to thwart.
dwme6cd,AnythngControversial,"Of course not! That would be a sensible thing to do, and we can't have that, now can we?"
dwmj4ps,topasaurus,"The money was donated to stop the song from being played, not for suicide prevention. They would need to do another fundraiser for that."
dwmfwr0,gufcfan,"It's not about the money, it's about sending a message."
dwmopdg,SamuraiJono,Some students just wanna watch the school burn.
dwmj3xr,cookiepizza54,Kid would've been a martyr
dwmjcuo,mapleaugarfairygod,He died for a good cause
dwnj6c7,Melkath,The only torture more proven than chinese water torture is audio warfare.
dwmcqfc,JohnithanDoe,My school used the hamster dance song. They had to stop after a special needs kid put a chair through a wall.

dwmffqm,Grundwissen,What is it with all these schools torturing kids for money?
dwmgkf7,Wanhope,It's almost always student councils suggestions
dwmh7d7,snorting_dandelions,"Sure, but the adults still have to agree on it and think ""Extortion sounds like a great idea to fund our school""."
dwmjxni,2fucktard2remember,As learned in Civics class.
dwms3sm,Wanhope,"Evidently it worked.It was probably one adult who lost a game of ""nose goes"" and who only passed the idea over to the VP via a post-it about ""fun song playing between classes"""
dwmgyh3,mxpph,They are the worst types of people.
dwmh8p3,JarnabyBones,They really are.
dwmi655,I_Has_A_Hat,"Either way too into themselves and the position goes to their head, or they won the position as a popularity contest and dont give a shit."
dwmkohr,helix19,"Well, it's not like the administration gives the student council actual money from the budget to achieve anything on their own."
dwmrw30,Wanhope,I didn't insinuate anything else.
dwmilev,Kildigs,Anyone familiar with the [stanford experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html) shouldn't be surprised when the student council implements [torture tactics used by the CIA](https://mic.com/articles/87851/11-popular-songs-the-cia-used-to-torture-prisoners-in-the-war-on-terror#.uVzS47mBm).
dwmh960,Strykerz3r0,"Yep, even this post was suggested by students. Too much fun to rant and rave about law suits and the education system, though."
dwmfnox,FBI_Taco_Truck,Well do you expect the government to fund them? This is free market extortion! Like god intended
dwmguyq,KingOfVermont,Murica!
dwmitpp,CeruleanRuin,"When the government tasked with funding them doesn't fund them, they have to resort to unusual means."
dwmip9m,CyanideIX,Isn't that the definition of the word “School?”
dwmg1al,le_vybrosit_account,"And then they cry about not having enough funding while taking taxes from people who don't even have kids. Schools can eat ass, I wish education was reformed. Same with how many teachers are assholes, yet cry about being underpaid."
dwmgpjs,Jarrz,> while taking taxes from people who don't even have kidslmao what? but those people did visit school innit?
dwmjxye,82Caff,"People move to different areas. You can work and live in an area nowhere near schools you attended. Some people even attend private schools, which, generally speaking, are not publicly subsidized."
dwmmfd0,Jarrz,So what? This attitude is individualism gone wrong.
dwmh9sk,JarnabyBones,Sounds like a lot of anger and possible misunderstandings about our education system. How can we all help you have a better sense of things?
dwmgghk,TaylorS1986,"> They had to stop after a special needs kid put a chair through a wall.As an autistic person with sensory sensitivities, I can't blame the kid, LOL."
dwmi36v,CannibalisticVegan,"As someone with autism (and sensory sensitivities) I fully agree. That shit is fucked up when you can't filter out things, best analogy I can say is its like running an engine at full tilt while its misfiring and wondering why it seized up and shot your ass through the windshield."
dwmv6z8,Blindweaponsfumbler,"As a non-autistic person with high tolerance for sensory unconfortabilities, I can't blame him either."
dwmhvzg,N_D_V,"I love how chill you are about being autistic, that's really awesome. I mean I'm sure it's very hard, but it's cool that you can make jokes and be chill about it."
dwmlttj,MulattoLatte,You realize it's s spectrum right..?
dwmlxpn,N_D_V,"Lol fuck off. Yeah, I know it's a spectrum, but it's still cool how open and joking he is about it. Most people wouldn't be. They would be embarrassed. A lot of people are on the autism spectrum, and yet it's rare to see someone so open and relaxed about it. It's cool. Don't at all understand why I would be downvoted for what I said. It was a compliment."
dwmlzzf,MulattoLatte,Why are you swearing? Your comment was perceived as talking down that's why you got downvoted idiot.
dwmm3kt,N_D_V,I guess it was just frustrating that I was being perceived as talking down to someone when what I was trying to do was the exact opposite.
dwmo5p0,BrokenGamecube,"You must not have gotten the memo. Your intentions are meaningless these days, bud. Others get to decide what your words mean and if we don't like it, too bad, you're an irredeemable asshole./s"
dwmo96e,N_D_V,"Haha, I guess you're right"
dwo4bzb,Mejti,"Your comment *is* talking down. The guy was trying to be positive and you're then doing what you're accusing him of because you misinterpreted him. Are you actually offended by his statement or are you just unable to get off your high horse and feel the need to actually talk down to people who are trying to be a decent person?Disclaimer: I'm autistic, his comment didn't offend me."
dwoue54,N_D_V,"Hey man, I appreciate you defending me. I feel like you're one of the few people here who actually understands what I was saying."
dwo381h,Mejti,"As someone with autism, self deprecating humour is a major coping mechanism (for me personally).(Also for what it's worth I didn't think your comment was talking down to him)"
dwou9we,N_D_V,I appreciate that :)
dwmfi00,Oper8rActual,Through... a wall. Not into a wall... Through one. That's impressive.
dwmgj7e,Ianoren,Maybe he gently scooted it through a doorway so technically it went through a wall. That way he was away from the speaker and song.
dwmk0rd,sciphre,His special need was Natasha Romanoff
dwmixt9,eric2332,"Actually, if it was a recently built wall, it might just be a few inches of cardboard with some plaster over it."
dwmhbvn,FierceDeity_,"Should try that here, our school has 30 cm thick outer walls and the inner walls are at least 20cm of brick."
dwmhh3j,sndecker,Sounds like something straight out of 4chan greentext
dwml41m,tdt0005,That would just make me excited. I'd be bouncing between classes.
dwmbk6d,slpsht954,Mine used the song as well. But they changed it because no one was donating and instead enjoying the song. They changed it to choosing a song after a few days.
dwmicqm,Very_legitimate,"Yeah jokes on them, I bought that album because of that song so play it away"
dwmlw0j,MulattoLatte,Fuck I gotta try and find my copy. You just reminded me about it
dwmgbno,Lezarkween,Don't they have to pay royalties if they play songs for the big group of people? Especially if they make them pay to choose which song will play?
dwmim6f,aetheradept,No
dwn5ymg,MrMagPi,My school had a radio station that was hosted inside the school and we were allowed to play whatever music we wanted because it fell under educational use. But I'm not sure it would qualify for playing music in between bells to coerce donations.
dwmifqq,Phineas_Godwinn,What? No? Do you think DJs pay royalties to play music at weddings?
dwmjh2r,Lezarkween,"I think they do yes, if they do it legally. Do you think people can make money off someone else's music for free?"
dwmj93s,gorocz,Pretty sure they should.
dwmjboj,JF_Queeny,Yes.https://www.ascap.com/music-users/licensefinder
dwmn1yn,Southtown85,Yes
dwnd94z,Bill_buttlicker69,Lmao you learned something today.
dwmicay,mitchC1,Most bells are about 10 seconds or less... would probably be legal use those snippets?
dwmjffo,JanThaMan,It happens the 5-10 minutes between bells.
dwmv45z,thebestdaysofmyflerm,"My school only had four minutes, it was ridiculous."
dwnitg0,johnyreeferseed710,"4 minutes between classes and 20 minute lunches, my school sucked"
dwmgnqs,cj6464,The school probably had subscriptions to corporate radios that cover the royalties with the subscription cost.
dwmhtny,raptoricus,I think you're overestimating how legally responsible the organizers of most school fundraisers are
dwmluk1,cj6464,Im just saying its a possibility. I worked alongside faculty in high school while working on the play and other presentations. We had certain subscriptions to radio stations and song lists that we could use because the school paid for the service and then the service paid for royalties. Now the people who organize school fundraisers may or may not have had access to it but Im just saying its a possibility. I agree fundraiser organizers aren't terribly smart especially with this idea.
dwmhfzx,frenzyboard,I hope all the metal and thrash kids payed out in a big way.
dwmftff,himym101,"My school used the same song and called the fundraising ""Stop the Bop"". The following year we used Fruit Salad by the Wiggles."
dwmhh0o,Strykerz3r0,"As someone who had kids during the Wiggles era, I would pay up pretty quickly if they started playing 'Fruit Salad' at my office. Those guys were great, and I celebrate their entire catalogue, but I have heard them all way too many times now."
dwmhn9p,himym101,We heard it for 20 and 40 minute stretches every day for a week. The song is only 30 seconds of original music and then it basically repeats. There's a little high note they hit that is my favourite part now.
dwmsf1n,Darkseid_Omega,Fruit salEEEHHHddd!
dwn1m2v,TheTrevosaurus,Unless it happens to be Psychosalad one day... would make for an interesting office environment
dwmnnik,dishie,Yummy yummy
dwmgyjt,retix,My high school tried it back in 2006(?). They gave up after 3 days because no one was donating. My classmates and I didn't like extortion.
dwmjx5u,pretendimnotme,Don't let the terrorists win
dwmmynw,nezzthecatlady,"Here too. They tried playing Friday incessantly during breaks on Fridays. Everyone refused to donate and even the teachers got in on bashing the teacher who thought it was a good idea. It lasted three weeks, they raised less than $10, and made everyone hate them."
dwmpmev,brohearts,FHS by chance? This is exactly what happened when my school tried this fundraiser.
dwn4ppe,retix,"Nope, but it seems to be a general trend that this style fundraiser fails. Our student council heard that another local high school tried it and raised a lot of money in a few days. So of course they figured it would work at our school. It backfired in that no one donated and one teacher actually cried at my language arts class for being “selfish”."

dwmfrr3,joevsyou,what was their reason. Whatever happen to old fashion bake sales? When i was in school we had at least one every month. Also our art teacher made these amazing thick brownies she sold every week for money for art supplies.
dwmivo7,CeruleanRuin,But that requires effort and participation by parents! How dare you suggest this!
dwmrdry,joevsyou,Ya. The school could do it. Go spend 25 bucks to make more money.
dwmlxkm,gobabygo11,"Teacher here. In my experience, a lot of parents cause issues when their children with food allergies can't participate in certain things. No more bake sales for us! :("
dwmr9no,joevsyou,Sadddd thing.
dwn11ri,ExtraordinarySuccess,Food allergies and lack of trust in homemade goods. Now everything needs to be storebought in the district.
dwmpvm6,youmustvebeenhigh,People don't trust others to make food for their kids. A bake sale nowadays would have to be store-bought stuff.
dwmr8oa,joevsyou,"Thats okay, kids will buy anything with icing on it"

dwmca51,hanhange,"Ha, using the school's overly cautious attitude against them. Kids used to do that all the time where I live (relatively close to the area in OP) with bomb threats."
dwmhpna,taintosaurus_rex,"""Hey principal, I gotta tell you something. I'm really excited about it. Uh, for the first time today, I woke up, I came to the school, and I feel confident to say to you that if you don't stop playing this Hanson song that you've been playing for two weeks straight, I'm going to kill everyone in the school and put a bullet in my brain.""EDIT: To any NSA agents spying on this thread, this is a quote from 40 year old virgin. Please do not think this is me actually planning to shoot up a school."
dwmgi79,Ss4gogeta0,"You missed out. Back in the 90s, you couldnt escape that shit. Hear it in school, hear it on the radio, etc. It got worse during the whole boy band boom of the late 90s. I still have aaron carter and dream street (me and my friends used to call em pee street) songs stuck in my head to this day. Hell they were worse than Nsync and backstreet boysUs 90 kids survived hell itself"
dwmh7v9,shortizsk8ing,"Charlotte, NC?"
dwmlb18,BizGilwalker,PHS?
dwmow7w,shortizsk8ing,Yup. Class of 08. I remember the mmm-bop in the hallways.
dwmffs9,psychblueberry,"Mine played mmm bop as well. I wonder if we went to the same high school, or we just went to eerily similar schools. More strange days of Blake Holsey High"
dwmhig0,Garmaglag,"It probably wasnt that uncommon, my school did it as well but it sort of backfired because people liked having something to listen to between classes. It was a number of years ago but iirc they kept playing music after the fundraiser but switched from mmbop to a normal song rotation."
dwmfh2v,McArthurWheeler,Seems like a *good* way to get them to stop
dwmgd6x,Narzath91,DEHS?

dwmffzn,FortniteHedgeMaze,"If I recall, in Marshall we had to cease and desist because we had financial gain from someone else's property... Or did someone threaten suicide?! oO"
dwmh8b7,Lordbungus,Desert Vista High School? They did the same.
dwpjode,Schmuckey,Where I went! Good ole thunder actually thinking about it not sure what year. Between 2007-2009
dwmhwlv,Searaph72,My highschool did this as well. They didn't raise a lot of money at first so the song went for like 2 weeks. People hated it. They stopped when almost all of the teachers complained. Still don't like the song.
dwmhwro,TheDearHunter,"Yep. My school did the same fundraiser for their business club called ""Stop the Bop"". I did not donate."
dwmkdw5,jambomyhombre,Did you go to high school in southeast PA?
dwmfq7q,Jagtogg,"We did that shit too, bum fuck Indiana knows how to torture I guess :/"
dwmga0w,Fuzzlechan,My school also played Mmbop. Really curious if we went to the same school. St. Mary's?
dwmgjib,420Sheep,"Lol, if I was still in high school I'd freaking pay to have them play that song in between classes"
dwmgjs5,techmma,"PNHS? Yeah, I remember that. Good times, if I remember correctly that got a good amount from that."
dwmgm98,haddockcpt,You didn't happen to go to Xavier University? They did the same thing to us in 2009 but it was for one of the women's sports team. I remember a guy yelling from the top of the student center and people just being pissed.

dwmhmzf,butt-guy,"Mine used Rebecca Black's ""Friday"". It was stupid and I don't even know if they ended up raising the amount they wanted before they stopped."
dwmhok1,Forbidd3nMonk3y,Did you go to school in suburban Missouri? We did this and it was called 'Stop the Bop'.
dwmhxim,Eman-resu-,My college used to do this in the dining hall until the dining hall works complained they couldn't take it any more!!!
dwmi1x3,BootsToYourDome,My high school also did this.
dwmi409,turtleprincess24,Mine too! Only it was well before 2009 and no-one went that dark as a result. Kids these days!
dwmi7mu,cooterdick,Tennessee?
dwmianc,ilaughallthetime,Our school did the exact same thing with the same ending. We may have gone to the same high school. NHHS ring a bell?
dwmic02,MacReadysHat,My highschool did the same. But this was 2002. And no one threatened to commit suicide. I think the teachers just made it stop at the 2 week point.
dwmii73,-heresiarch-,power move
dwmingc,ThePrince_OfWhales,Did we go to the same high school in WA? Because my high school did this too...
dwmis28,aravena,That's why this practice is wrong and probably illegal.
dwmj4tj,RUSH513,"isnt playing a song over an over again, a legit torture tactic? can't these schools be sued?"
dwmk386,DrCosmo91,"We did that and it was called ""Stop the Bop"""
dwmk3j2,shruikan13,"They did the same thing in my high school in 2006 (I think)... They called it ""Stop the Bop."""
dwmk4dp,ejoburke90,"My college did the same thing when I was a freshman, in the dining hall. Result - they didn't come near their goal, and the caf was a ghost town until it stopped."

dwmkd11,FatsPizzaHut,"Oh my God. That's brilliant, I wish I'd thought of that."
dwmkfdm,ChaosAndMath,Did you go to Penn rest during Stop The Bop?!
dwmkjlc,superscout,"I would kill myself, too"
dwmkk0y,Lancia4Life,"Best part is it was anonymous, so they wouldn't have to kill themselves... just somome from the school would have to die."
dwmklwu,dempa,Did you go to liberty?
dwmknm5,connorg35,I would've just not gone to school and said I'd return when it stopped.
dwml4am,CausaPatet,This must be the song they like to torture students with as this happened at mine too in 2005.
dwml4r6,im_twelve_,"I've never even heard of schools doing this, but I was a MAJOR Hanson fan in the 90's. I would've been so stoked to hear this at school!"
dwml8lv,BizGilwalker,"Hey, mine too! I don't recall a suicide note though"
dwmlaph,ns_dev,"Mine (similar time) used cats and dogs singing Christmas songs on breaks and lunches, thankfully they could be disabled in the classrooms."
dwmlbah,AnthonySlips,In Arizona? My school did the same thing
dwmlczp,vickipaperclips,"Are you Canadian? My school did this too, called it 'Stop The Bop'."
dwmlfab,wadaup,"We had a ""Stop the Bop"" around that time too, probably 2007. I remember thinking that it was a boring fundraiser and they should try harder if they want my money."
dwmlrgf,ronton_soup_,Did you go to a high school around Houston?
dwmm9g8,jimkeyjimkey,Did you go to school in MI? My school did this with Mmm bop in 2009. I was a punk so I just walked up to the PA system and turned it off. The whole cafeteria clapped. Then I asked the principle why they're using psychological warfare tactics on teenagers.
dwmmcxv,scootstah,TIL the real reason for school shootings.
dwmme0u,Dudelyllama,"Holy shit, my school as well!"
dwmmesa,airbusdriver321,Sounds like we went to the same high school. Did they play it exclusively during lunch?
dwmmg95,SomethingInAirwaves,Are you from Canada? I remember hearing this story on MOD when I was in high school.
dwmmneh,Classified0,My high school did the same thing with Rebecca Black's Friday.
dwmmpkd,cowhisperer,Johnson county highschool?
dwmmpoz,juyett,"Nothing fancy, but our school did one too around that time. They played ""Sandstorm"" and raised a decent bit of money for the prom committee. Honestly it's a fun way to extort money from students and teachers."
dwmn2px,xMoody,My high school also did this with the same song but instead of wanting monetary donations they were asking for used cell phones that could be sold or recycled or something. It went on for weeks because surprisingly none of the students had a massive cache of old cell phones to donate.
dwmn9fr,ticktocktoe,"Funny enough. My school also did it with mmm bop, must have been like 2003? The teachers threw a bitch fit and it was turned off by day 2 lol."
dwmnpvp,gingerbeardy,"Downingtown East? We did that too...it was like the 2nd week of my freshman year...like 2007 or 2008. I think it only lasted a day or two, and after that they switched to something like make a donation to request a song."
dwmrp22,IABJordan,"My school used this song as well, but the complaints came from the people that lived across the street from the school."
dwmsefx,jdsizzle1,Mine too. Same time period. During lunch too. I just popped in my iPod between classes to avoid it. And ate in my car for lunch. Fuck that bullshit.We didn't raise very much money because we all collectively thought it was bullshit and the staff just gave up.
dwmt9ae,VWolfy,Was this in Ohio?
dwmtkju,aaraabellaa,"I was going to say, my school did something similar too. The obnoxious part was that it was overly loud and bad quality. Otherwise I don't think anyone would have cared"
dwmw9mi,bong-water,We had the same thing except the teachers eventually stopped it themselves because it was so fucking annoying and no one wanted to pay
dwn1zv7,MeLdArmy,https://youtu.be/-GPffhQtfGI

dwmcce0,Michaelbama,"My school did this with Rebecca Black's 'Friday'.It lasted 2 periods, because some kid *really* deep on the spectrum started flipping shit."
dwmcxlr,cruznick06,"I mean, I would have immediately threatened organized protests. Getting from one end of the school, up two flights of stairs, and to the opposite corner in 6 minutes was hard enough."

My high school was 2900 kids, 4 buildings ranging from 3 to 6 floors each, and had a huge open concrete span of a courtyard, and we had exactly 3 minutes between classes. I regularly had to go from the 4th floor of one building to the 5th floor of another, across the courtyard. Lateness was met with detention. Yeah..."
dwxu41o,cruznick06,"That...that is not okay. Like, REALLY not okay. Sounds like when I had to go to polar opposite ends of campus (literally the two buildings with the furthest possible distance between them) in the span of 10 minutes. And the first class always let out *late*. So really it was 7 minute on a good day, 4 on a bad day. Even with a bike and *cutting through two buildings carrying it* I would barely make it.Edit: this was college and half of the second class was thankfully in the first class so the professor couldn't really penalize us for it (thankfully they were a decent human being.)"

I found out about this as a teenager when I was playing this song while doing dishes and my Dad made me turn it off. Turns out, over 30 years later, he still can't stand to listen to it."
dwmnjug,zkiller195,What's really bad is that they play shit like that on those top 10 stations all the time. And replay the same 10 songs 24/7. Millions of people listen these radio stations voluntarily.
dwmrmlq,Throwaway_Consoles,"What, you thought your military training started when you enlisted? The radio has been training you to resist modern torture methods since birth.By the way, that website is similar to the onion. The military doesn't actually use those songs to torture people."

dwmfh5g,bighootay,I heard a local school did it with that camel saying *Hump DAY* then had to tell the students to shut up because they loved it and wouldn't shut up

dwmj8i8,LowestKDgaming,We went to the same school 😂😂😂
dwn0c5o,wip30ut,"i'm kinda amazed that given how much cringe & hate this one song gets, it's made Rebecca Black a multi-millionaire and a social media ""influencer"" with hundreds of thousands of followers on insta and twitter.

I'm refering to torturing as forcefully let people listen to loud music for a prolonged period of time, a detail which you purposefully omitted and that [makes it, according to international bodies, torture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations).If not democracy nor the market has decided your """"""art"""""" should be paid, you don't exploit your powers over vulnerable people that were entrusted in custody to you for educational purposes and torture (yes, torture: however bland it may be) them to extort money. You go find a real job, like everyone else.I don't get your point about not believing this."

dwmyho9,Saturnix,"And you know that because... ? ""I'm sure the music intended to bother people was played at a volume intended not to bother people: they raised 1.000$ out of the good hearth of those kids, surely not because they were actually bothered by the music"". Why am I not surprised that this reasoning comes out from the same person who support torture as a method of financing art?"

dwmf8yz,MailOrderHusband,"Passing periods aren't “all day”If they did that, they'd have to buy the rights from Bieber first"
dwmct8a,CaesarCzechReborn,"Its about the principle behind it. The scale of Pay us or we play very annoying song we know you cant avoid because you need to attend school, is small but the principe is the same."
dwmdmxt,SamURLJackson,And they're doing it to fucking children
dwme6sb,426164_576f6c66,"Let's make this clear, they didn't torture children and then threaten them for money. They did something light hearted. They probably were going to play the song for the same period of time regardless of how much they raised."
dwmetsb,freshfishfinderforty,Playing unwanted music is literally one of the more common forms of torture used.
dwmict4,Warpimp,It's an interrogation technique used by US forces in Iraq and Afgahnistan.
dwmh07u,mnmkdc,It definitely wasn't torture. But it was definitely annoying to a lot of students and I don't think they should have done it Edit: Guys. Don't be overly dramatic. There's a massive difference between this and torture...
dwmf04i,SamURLJackson,"I didn't think anyone was torturing or threatening the kidsSince the market isn't cornered yet, though, I'm going to follow kids around with my hand out and making annoying sounds until they pay me to go away. It's not torture or a threat so I'll be fine"

dwmie3m,Warpimp,Yup. He and some of the teachers invested in the project theyal are raising money for.
dwmisi3,Avachiel,It was a play on words due to his use of the word princple. /r/jokesuicide
dwmcvzx,MailOrderHusband,"No, the principle is not the same. Pay us or we do something bad to YOU is different from a minor annoyance to the whole school. If you don't pay, no one would know. So only those with the capability and motivation to pay end up paying.Very different from extortion, which often targets those least able to pay with punishments they can least afford to avoid."

We have arms deals with Poland, cops shooting each other, etc but this thread is front page anger central. #firstworldproblems"
dwmpcs1,Warpimp,"How do you think we wind up with these major problems? Because we're trained in school to be concerned primarily with commercial concerns. We leant how to be good buyers and sellers, not great critical thinkers. We get taught that those with authority have different rules than us. We're taught to not rock the boat or complain. Major issues and small issues like this are interlinked, it is a societal issue."

dwmfim5,Dark_Dare,They used 'hit songs' to get information out of prisoners of war in Guantanamo.
dwmfm44,MailOrderHusband,"I'm sure they only played them during passing period there, too. Totally relevant link, here."
dwmdq8z,JustOneProletariat,"First of all it's about the principle of the matter, second of all this seems incredibly distracting not only during the actual playing of the song but because it would be a subject being widely talked about in the school by the kids, and therefore definitely distract from learning time.And now that I think about it this gives the kids with more money more influence over their school environment and the learning environment of other kids. What if some kids paid to have the song off one day, and then some wealthy asshole kid said he would pay ten times as much for them to play the song all day long?"
dwmf5r7,MailOrderHusband,"First off, school time is spent 90% gossiping, so adding to the gossip doesn't change learning time for most. Those who would talk about this, would also be those that would talk about other things in “learning time”Second, wtf no one said this was a bribe system. What if a wealthy billionaire paid cancer foundations to GIVE PEOPLE CANCER?! Oh wait, that's not a legit possibility because that's not how donation systems work."
dwmdnxn,howlinggale,Time for me to blast the the number 1 single from Turkey during the summer of 1986. Probably ends up being a Western song. Any Turkish people able to inform me what song this would be?

dwm6jwv,jooes,"I helped with fundraisers all the time when I was in high school.We did it for things like school dances and the various events that we ran. School dances were pretty expensive and would easily cost a few hundred dollars once you factor in the cost of the DJ and rent-a-cops and stuff. We'd often make money off the dances (so they were like their own fundraiser), but still, that initial money has to come from somewhere. And then that money would go on to funding the other events that we had throughout the year. So, things like Halloween days or Christmas events or whatever. These things cost money, and it's something the kids want (at least so they can get out of class for the day) but it's not something the school itself is willing to pay for.Prom/Graduation was a big thing too. Those things are pretty expensive. I went to a super small high school, and that thing was still probably a couple thousand dollars to run....We occasionally fundraised for a specific cause as well. Like raising money so certain kids would shave their heads, and then giving the money to some cancer charity. Or at one point, we bought a goat for an African village or some shit. I personally thought that one was pretty dumb, but these two girls were super into it and wouldn't stop going on and on about it so that happened. That was like $400 too, it was ridiculous...Most of the more expensive classes ran their own fundraisers as well. Things like shop, music, even gym class, all to try to get new equipment.... Or I know our English/History classes would raise money to send kids to museums or plays and things like that.At the end of the day, you don't *have* to donate money, but schools can't really afford to pay for a lot of the fun things kids want to do, so fundraisers seem fine to me.... unless you're raising money for a goat, then that's just stupid. Fucking Amy and Nicole..."
dwmao38,Oxyuscan,Heifer International (I think it's called?) is probably the goat thing. IIRC livestock is a really good way to help people in developing countries since unlike just sending cash it's less likely to be misused by local authorities and is essential in places with no infrastructure
dwmgg2m,TinyLittleFlame,$400 is pretty expensive for a goat (my father in law is in the giat business). I suppose they don't buy the goat from the african country. They buy it abroad and send it there so the $400 includes contirbution towards the transport costs
dwmczog,Usgarden,TL;DR: fundraising for school prom and dances is fine. Helping poor African nations and people who are much worse off is stupid.WTF OP?
dwmg6hx,acosmichippo,"firstly, i don't think anyone has the position you just tl;dr'ed.Secondly, i think this is more about the method used than anything - annoying kids during their break/transition period during school hours seems borderline unethical, regardless of the purpose.thirdly, this fundraising was for part of the actual school, not charity or entertainment. This is making kids pay for their own school costs rather than taxes, which creates all kinds of problems."
dwmgh6p,Usgarden,Read the post I replied to...
dwmgedd,RoteSocke,"I find the notion of fundraising for public schools so strange. It seems completely unfair to make the kids or parents pay for anything, much less new equipment. If it's a public school it should be publicly funded, if it is an non-essential non-school event the kids can fund and run it on their own outside of the school with no policy of the school taking influence on the event."
dwmglgi,MaskedPlatypus,Fundraising and donating to something that you want to contribute to is completely different than having your life disrupted and being held at ransom until you pay for something regardless of your belief.
dwmamit,Singular1st,This is not a fundraising event. It feels wrong. Taking this as being okay would set precedent for deliberate ear rape and I'm not into that

dwmo0h2,aconfusednoob,It was a charity drive run by some of the kids! Would've been weird of the school itself had run it. Kid on kid torture.
dwmj1oo,CyanideIX,Lol that's hilarious. They should've smashed all the speakers in the school.

dwmh76l,SpicyShiznity,"My school tried to do this with 'What the Fox Say' to raise money to send our cheerleaders to regionals.There were walk outs and the administration ended up apologizing for extorting their students. The cheerleading team also had a crying session because, ""We thought our school supported us.""Not when you support terroristic pressure methods though. Sorry gals. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
dwmqol4,GsolspI,They should have sold videos of the crying session
dwno0i6,Chrighenndeter,"Nah, you have to make it a ""when we reach this goal, we will release the video"" thing.If you sell the video, you'll sell one copy and it will end up on the internet. Then every student/Japanese businessman will be able to masturbate to it without paying you."

dwmbj0s,Darthsodope,"They did this same thing when I was in high school in Saginaw, MI except it was the macarena. But, plot twist, they held our education for ransom and played it during class instead of in-between classes until they raised enough money. I can't remember what they we're raising money for."
dwmhi3p,I-_-II,Your parents are paying tax money so you can sit in a room and listen to Macarena until they or you pay more money.

dwmf23a,wildadragon,If that happens you go to the principal and tell him/her you'll report him/her to the RIAA for copyright infringement for not paying performance royalties on the song since they are trying to make money from its use.
dwmhjhq,the1exile,Strictly they're trying to make money from not using the song.
dwmly93,wildadragon,They're making the money to stop playing it means it's already playing so they owe royalties.Your version is a threat like if you don't raise the money then we will play it.
dwmhskp,TarBallsOfSteel,Would that work if it's charity/donation? They're not profiting technically speaking.
dwmk1ba,SomeCallMeWaffles,Yes. No one cares why you are performing music or copying a work you don't rights to copy. Not making money is not a defence to infringement of public performance rights. See the guide available for students and faculty of KU for their take on the subject (https://guides.lib.ku.edu/copyright/ppr) which explains the subject in relation to an education setting pretty well.
dwmfwv0,Silver6Rules,"See this would be the perfect opportunity to sell earplugs at 5 bucks a pop. Since we all doing illegal shit here.

dwmg3er,zebreck,"The one time I've ever been in a fight that I myself started was over this during undergrad. Just outside my window some shitstains started blasting MmmBop, 24/7, until they got some absurd amount of money to make it stop. After complaining to the campus authorities did nothing, and after 2 days of no sleep and constant psychological warfare, I'd had enough. That evening I took a scissors, went to auditory ground zero, and cut their power cords into pieces. The head shitstain came to stop me, called me some name or other, and I hit him in the face until he stopped. I got arrested by campus security and spent the night in their offices, but the review panel the next morning was in a mood to be extremely lenient given the circumstances. Better though, that sort of extortionist bullshit was banned shortly after due to safety concerns."
dwmhgm3,CreatrixAnima,"First of all, you didn't start that fight. The person who is blasting music in at you 24 seven dead. Secondly, you could've defended yourself by saying you were suffering from sleep deprivation. What a bullshit thing for them to have allowed."

dwmf3y8,The_Fetaljuice,"Kids in my high school tried something similar and half the people just walked out, it was for some drama festival trip that only a dozen kids were going on so nobody gave any fucks at all. They also played the victim card afterwords and claimed the rest of the school didn't have any spirit, even after the constant reminders that they thought extorting the entire student body was a suitable way to fundraise."
dwmqwrp,GsolspI,I don't get this. Why sours every club or group donthe same thing and turn the school into a mad band battle? Why only one random group?
dwmfvsu,MRAGGGAN,My high school played Rebecca Black's *Friday*... every Friday. All fucking day. They did it just because. Not to get us to pay to stop it.
dwmhkmu,CreatrixAnima,I can't even comprehend this. That song shouldn't even warrant a footnote in musical history yet you've got entire schools being harassed by it.
dwmcjth,deanthecleanmachine,I remember when I was away at school and they did this in my dorm early Saturday. Everyone just left and day drank
dwm94e1,PuddleOfMush,I honestly would have just not come to school. If they're going to pull bullshit like that don't even play their games.

dwn4p2p,PuddleOfMush,"It's not the song, it's a matter of principle. It's extortion and quite frankly students shouldn't be a school's source of income because, unsurprisingly, students themselves tend to be broke.

dwmhv41,Mostofyouareidiots,I know you're joking around but seriously this post just demonstrates the level of professionalism and competence in our school system. They'll never be able to identify and remove dangerous students because most can't even figure out that torturing kids between classes is a bad idea. I know a lot of teachers and many are just pounding down anti-depressants and waiting until they can collect on their shitty retirement plan.
dwml1eb,jojobean516,"This was almost 7 years ago. It was done by the elected student representatives, not the school administration. Also, it only happened once per day during the 5 minute passing period between third and fourth period.Source: I went there."

dwmukhd,Mostofyouareidiots,"Yeah but it sounds like this happens at a lot of other schools too and it has caused problems. Part of being an adult in charge of a school is telling kids ""that's a bad idea and we can't do it"". Also it's literally teaching the kids extortion."

dwmfp4g,patkgreen,Most people outside the Chicago metro area would consider Evanston as Chicago.
dwmgopy,annafelloff,"but it's a different town, so specifying that is appropriate. Evanston is also demographically pretty different from Chicago. they aren't the same place."

dwml0rb,annafelloff,"thanks, i am all right at parties!"
dwmr1s4,GsolspI,Actually they are invited to an area nearby the party. Don't misrepresent their party experience.
dwmrwv6,patkgreen,This honestly made me laugh out loud. Nice.
dwmh94e,Comrade_Mittens,"Most people outside Chicago consider everything within an hour radius as Chicago. The “what neighborhood did you grow up in?”, is my favorite rebuttal."
dwmr2cu,GsolspI,"""Evanston"""
dwmkzgj,patkgreen,"It's like that for every city landmark. Many people can be familiar with 1-2 cities in a state and if you're close to one of them it makes a sense of familiarity for other people. Like, I'm from a solid hour outside buffalo (a rural hour, so 60+ miles) but unless I'm hanging out with locals I say I'm from the buffalo area. Because pointing shit out to be technically right all the time makes you a dick."
dwmllms,Comrade_Mittens,"I guess, but now that I've moved, if it comes up in conversation people will often say “me too.” I used to get excited and ask what neighborhood and they'd say something that was 45 minutes outside the city. There's a difference between growing up in Chicago and growing up in Evanston that people who didn't grow up in the actual city can't understand. Particularly the city's evolution and why so many generational chicagoans have left. It's a nice thing to be able to relate with somebody without them acting like they understand why you left and saying something aggravating like, “because it's so violent.”"
dwms3q7,patkgreen,"Sure, once you're getting that specific it makes sense to point that stuff out. When you're mentioning it just to apply a region to give people context, saying the major city makes the most sense, especially because unless they live or have spent a good amount of time there, 99% of people won't have any clue where Evanston is ( or have a relative in the college or whatever). That's not people being dumb or ignorant."

dwmh7lf,retix,"What is with People from Chicago being so obsessed over whether it is actually Chicago or not? Evanston is part of the Chicagoland Area and for most interactions is good enough to say is Chicago. Most people wouldn't know offhand where Evanston is, but they do know where Chicago is."
dwmi844,tommy285,Because you have different life experiences if you grew up in the suburbs. You're misrepresenting yourself if you say you're from Chicago but actually from Evanston
dwmj6do,retix,"I can appreciate that point of view. However, I think it only really matters in that particular area. When I lived in Howard (a suburb of Green Bay), we always said we were from Green Bay. It gets people to the general geographic area faster and easier than specifying Howard."

Most people don't care anyway, they're just being polite. But for the people actually from Chicago, it's a misrepresentation of experience.

dwmk0wz,luke827,That wouldn't surprise me at all.
dwmk467,Tigerfairy,"The money goes to an art center that does some great outreach though, and that year's song was What Does The Fox Say, so I was pretty grateful tbh"
dwmkhjx,luke827,There's much better methods of fundraising than extortion. Not to mention it's illegal to profit off of music that other people have made without their consent.
dwmkq5z,Tigerfairy,"Probably lol, but it was funny and people liked it. They played music during the 3rd passing period (which were about 10 minutes, so it wasn't the whole time) every friday anyways and used the same song for the whole year, it was supposed to improve morale I think, so the fundraisers were just a weird break in the usual schedule. And the money didn't go to the school! ETHS has a lot of things wrong with it, but that fundraiser defintely wasn't one of those things."
dwmr3tj,GsolspI,If people liked it why'd they pay to stop it
dwmfom2,Mikashuki,"If it was Chicago, some kid would of shot up the speakers"
dwmfic3,Qubesta,"My school tried this, the students flat refused to be extorted, and within a month they'd raised a mere $10. They gave up after about 2 months"
dwmr6h5,GsolspI,Your schoolmares are ready to lead the People's revolution
dwmgiao,kcins,"They did this in my high school, but with the song “do the Hustle” everyday for 2 months. They started to change the music after a kid broke and started screaming in the hallways to make it stop."
dwmhbr4,CreatrixAnima,"I'd be willing to scream, hold my ears, and cry. Take one for the team."
dwmfgaz,Scubasqueeze,My high school (VA) did the same thing but they had to stop it after about 3 hours because the special needs kids couldn't handle it. Turns out extorting kids backfires sometimes.

dwmv5mj,Warpimp,Not untrue.
dwmlou3,Wilthywonka,"A combination of several factors:-~~the fact that a lot of teachers teach as a last-resort career.~~ Ok so I'm a little bit off on this one. In the state I grew up in (WA) You need to have a BA and gone through a teacher's training program. Not necessarily last resort, but can easily become one for a struggling college graduate as your BA does not need to be specific to teaching. At least for public schools.-lack of funding/ broken system; teachers lower their standards so students get A's and therefore get from the system more federal funding to compensate for their lack of funding, to play the system that was trying to heighten standards. This lowering of standards allows crappy teachers to remain teachers.-teachers union; also allows shitty teachers to remain teachers. A lot of the time, once past their probation period (which is like 1-4 years in most cases) teachers can sit on their ass or be the most toxic people in the world and not get fired as long as they ascend to mediocrity during teacher observations (which aspire to be like random inspections but the execution and result is laughable)-over-prioritization of sports; some teachers are just there to be a coach rather than to actually cause students to learn (some exceptions of course, I've had good teachers that also coached). And I'd say a significant portion of the time these 'teachers' get promoted to principal. -bureaucracy.Source: went through school with a healthy amount of cynicism and observation.Of course this just paints the negative aspects. On the flip side, a significant portion of teachers teach because they wanted to teach in the first place and are good at it. They care about their students and push them to achieve a higher standard. You just have to get lucky I suppose."

Preppie scum hated anyone that didn't have nice cars, parents that paid for a D1 college after graduation, or the right opinions so we had no problem telling them to fuck off when they complained. Those pricks all had parents that could get them $10/hour jobs at a desk after school where they could do homework while the rest of us worked on farms or fast food for $7/hour where there wasn't any downtime. But for some reason they expected we could just throw down money like it was nothing.The fundraiser wasn't discussed with anyone outside that little in-group and we all hated it. Yes, I'm still bitter about it. What made me happy was that they didn't meet their initial goal that they thought they could get out of everyone."

dwmibza,S_____S,So... you want to empower governments to prevent children from getting jobs with the help of their parents?

dwmcscm,Ultimatestormer,What does that have to do with the price of eggs?
dwmdlvb,UndeadPhysco,Wow you really are a snowflake if you can't argue with anything but straw-mans and whataboutism.
dwmp484,whitestrice1995,"You would've have taken the job offer also, no pointing in hating other people who have it better that weren't doing anything to you"

dwmfklp,Onetwofour8,"They used Skinny Puppy songs at Gitmo to get information out of prisoners.Same thing, really."

dwmal8b,Corvya,Jokes on them. I like that song.~~I'm half serious~~
dwmg72p,WalrusEunoia,"Thanks to my sister, I know every single word to Ludacris' rap."
dwmaavi,meadowlarc1,"My high school did reasonably the same thing, except we played Hanson's ""MMMbop"". Ours went on for maybe 3 weeks because no one really cared what they were raising money for."
dwmburg,Shed412,They tried this at our school with the one Hanson Brothers song. It didn't end up working and everyone just kind of enjoyed having background noise during class changes.
dwmh4k0,The_Plotblocker,Right!? If they'd have played Mmbop at my school we would have all been rocking out between lessons lol
dwmlefa,gumbystruck,Hey did we go to the same school? lol they did the same thing at my school with the same song.
dwmmhq2,sadsadcity,Same exact thing here! They did mmmbop at my high school too.
dwm8y78,Laz_meister,That wouldn't bother me because I usually have my earbuds in.
dwmb0u0,TheFiredrake42,Problem solver right here.
dwmjlos,snoipah379,"Tbh I'd have someone hold me up, and I'd rip the speakers out of the ceiling. All you need is a screwdriver and a very annoying song"
dwmft2b,RunninSolo,"Little late, but I went to the same highschool as Justin Bieber (I believe he did mainly online courses though), they tried this during our lunch with the goal of raising $200 to make it stop. This started a full on civil war between teachers, there were a few that liked to claim Bieber's success was their doing and others that actually taught him at elementary school and knew what he was like. In the end they ended up stopping the fundraising effort because the principal thought it looked poorly on us to ""make fun of an alum""Edit: Just to clear something up about the knew what he was like, dude was not a good kid growing up, came from a shitty situation, but by all accounts from people who've interacted with him in the past couple years, seems like a decent guy now"
dwmfsqs,NullCase_RL,"Great idea. I'll try that next week.First I'll require people to give me a lot of money to pay for everything.Then I'll force a bunch of young people to spend the day stuck in a room of my choosing.Then I'll extort money from them by playing annoying music during their five minutes of temporary 'freedom.'Funny how it's immoral when individuals do it, but for the State? Now it's ""education."""
dwm9m18,KalessinDB,Local radio station did something similar with Barbie Girl all day on their station.
dwmb247,TheFiredrake42,"""COME ON BARBIE...""""-well, if you insist... Ah...ah! AH YEAH!!!"""
dwmakfc,cat_itol_hill,We had similar fundraising methods at my high school. One time we had someone begin to read the American Constitution with an annoying voice over the intercom (which didn't last very long). Surprisingly effective!
dwmb588,TheFiredrake42,UGH! What is this *crap*? Someone trying to tell me my legal rights as an American citizen? FUCK THAT NOISE!
dwmggb4,DemandsBattletoads,Well there was certainly a lot of drama on Twitter when NPR tweeted out the Declaration of Independence.
dwmbnwn,Jay-Hobo,"They did the exact thing at the high school I went to but they played the Chakaron makaron song for a canned food drive. By the end of the week, we had already broke the school record."
dwmalep,wonderwildskieslimit,"My school did this with the backyardigans theme song. It took much longer and was awful at the time, but I somehow look back on it with great fondness."
dwmh0ct,tumblrmustbedown,Mine did Dora the Explorer. I similarly look back and think it was hilarious
dwmf4m0,jessiemarie90,That's actually a catchy song. .... -mommy
dwmb7su,Jeebusify119,"My highschool did it with that ""mmbob"" song by Hansen I think. We refused to donate and after a month the administration stopped doing it"
dwmdgbo,Coug-Ra,Guess those kids never learned about the Eighth Amendment.
dwmg0sy,revpidgeon,Sounds like child abuse.
dwmjmou,Woosego,"This was my high school, ETHS! We actually only raised a few hundred before some rich kids dad paid off the rest..."

dwmve6b,EpicLevelWizard,"Didn't even think of that since it's for profit that's technically correct, the best kind of correct. That's an FCC matter I believe, even though the FCC are evil."
dwmbg10,Frystix,My school did this with What Does The Fox Say? Although I'm pretty sure the demand was $5000.My physics teacher was very vocal in his hate for that song.
dwmfnvi,fubarspeaks,Just training for those first jobs in retail at the mall...
dwmhocx,CreatrixAnima,This is the most true observation in the thread.

dwmgjmv,sharkbag,/r/aboringdystopia
dwmofoe,blue__sky,"This in a nutshell is what school is about. To break you and make you conform, but in a slower less torturous manner. No wonder kids are going mental and shooting up schools when administrators approve psychological torture as a fund raising technique."

dwmrptz,goodguy_asshole,"Isnt it some sort of crime to demand a ransom like this, extortion maybe..."
dwmwygi,ShallNotBeInfringed1,I believe there are other words for that like “extortion” and “cruel and unusual punishment”.
dwn08v9,InigoChromtoya,I believe that is called extortion
dwmb7am,TheFiredrake42,"Well damn. Apparently everyone else's high school extorted their students with popular, catchy, upbeat songs at the time...I feel really left out."
dwmfm8e,transtranselvania,Haha my high school wouldn't pull shit like that as my grad class was super apathetic. At the end of an assembly they actually shamed us and told us there wasn't going to be anymore dances that year because we didn't care enough to show up.
dwmfz5h,Bobthemime,"IKR.. music played in school was such a no-no that anyone trying to pull this stunt would have been suspended at the very least.We weren't allowed to talk in the hallways.. so people dancing and singing to ""Baby"" would have be abhorrent to the Senior Staff"
dwmi36m,XTRIxEDGEx,... You couldnt talk in the hallways? You couldnt shoot the shit outside of class for a few minutes before it started? Am i undersranding this correctly?
dwmj12k,Bobthemime,"I went to a Welsh Language school.. they were even stricter in the classroom. Asking a question on anything but perfect Welsh would get you a detention.. though that was abused so often that only the strictest teachers upheld it.It got really bad when we got a substitute teacher in (well more like a semi-perm teacher, as our notmal teacher was on maternity leave) and she was teaching English. We had to read English poems in welsh despite it being practice for our English Oral exam. You ever tried translating [""To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest With the Plough, November, 1785""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse) on the fly? Needless to say our class had near a month of detentions thanks to that teacher.Detentions in our school, especially at lunchtime was 80% of the alotted time. So school dinners, which we werent allowed to bring our own unless with written permission for allergies, or go out of campus until later years, meant that we got the burnt crap dinner that nobody else wanted.Good luck getting anything to eat or drink during break. It was a 3min walk to the detention room, we are there for 15minutes and that left 2 mins to get something to eat.. except the clunch room was a 5min walk away. You can see why most teachers didn't hold to the punishment."
dwmlymf,Catharas,This sounds like the worst school ever invented.
dwmmray,Bobthemime,"eh.. it wasn't so bad..it was only 10% of the teachers that made it bad.. and if you are lucky enough, you will never get them..Sadly I was always in the top sets (set system 1-4. with 1 being the people expected to get 4.0 and above, and set 4 are the ones lucky enough to write their name on the paper)"
dwm9c8d,LordofSodium,that happened at my school 3-4 years ago. fuck em
dwmdjdw,Niko19,"They did that in our school with the song ""mm bop"" by Hanson... i actually enjoyed it"
dwmdm8a,duckduckfuckduck,"My school did that with ""What does the fox say"". It went on for weeks."
dwmdpxk,DepravedDreg,I don't see why students didn't just bring earbuds and listen to whatever.
dwmead4,OrangePlatinumtyrant,Fuck that's genitals
dwmej0v,Zyx237,How is this legal?
dwmet3r,DoubleDuke101,"I'm surprised they got away with it, raising money from a song like that should be considered a breach of copyright.Source: I used to work IT in the Copyright Offices and despite my boozy lifestyle I still remember some of the shit I learned there."
dwmf2h1,modern_history,Evanston is not in Chicago.
dwmfbyx,ngpropman,I'm pretty sure that highschool is now a war criminal as psychological torture is against the Geneva Convention.
dwmfhfq,McGooby,"Cruel and unreasonable treatment, against the Geneva Convention."
dwmfkx8,DannyBog,"Pretty sure, this is how Republic of Korea got the DPRK to agree to denuclearization."
dwmg383,Sadi_Reddit,And I thought torture was banned in the US. hmm
dwmg4xo,-BeardedLurker-,Sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen.
dwmg673,Johnny_Rageface,And then you ask why there's so many school shootings.
dwmga6r,Skybear9,"Late to the party but the authorities did this my senior year with ""arms wide open"" in between each class period, before, after, and lunches.We didn't raise the money but they quit after a week once kids stopped showing up."
dwmgn51,UtiAnimi,"WTF, is that a thing in the US? If they would have tried that at my school, i and probably hundreds of other students would make our protest public."
dwmgocg,elkazay,I thought extortion was illegal
dwmgr8y,BrookeLovesBooks,Not when it's done to minors.
dwmgoch,kremlin888,The idiot that came up with this should be fired and the school board could use that freed up salary to save the program.
dwmgpac,Xifihas,Surprised it didn't result in a mass shooting.
dwmgrmd,DoctorJeebs,"This happened at my high school as well but they used ""Friday"" instead. They stopped after a day when someone threatened to sue."
dwmgwme,Archetyp33,Nice. Resorting to terror tactics lol
dwmgxcn,fuckyouoconnell,"My school did that. And then they switched the song to an even more annoying song. They did ""Dont worry be happy."" And then some other songs I can't remember and ended it with this is the song that never ends."
dwmh0ge,BRBarnard,I think this invokes the constitutional phrase cruel and unusual punishment.
dwmhc67,a-sentient-meme,"My high school saw this school do that, and tried to do the exact same thing. However, when this was announced, there was an agreement that went throughout the grades that we wouldn't be extorted. They said they were going to keep playing it until they raised a certain amount, but gave up after two weeks of no donations whatsoever."
dwmhyjg,nepalnt21,"this might sound all cute n funny and what-not, but i have legit anxiety when i am forced to listen to pop music. this would constitute a hostile schooling environment, in my book."
dwmj7ps,YoMothaFlippin,"""Fundraising Technique"" seems like a very nice name for ""Extortion"""
dwmk3fa,JayDog2347,That's messed up and unethical to purposefully annoy your students like that. Could be considered a form of torture. What has society come to...
dwmoee8,Carlos_Danger11,Creating a threat and charging for its reduction. There's a term for that...RACKETEERING
dwmojei,SephChasseur,"My school did this too. We lasted 3 months before the teachers gave up, cause no one was donating. The final straw was when some kid's organized a conga line past the office"
dwmpos1,cstevenson,who the fuck extorts money from high school students...?
dwmpqvp,TheRiverFag,They did this when I was in middle school. They raised no money because middle schoolers have no money.
dwmukhf,lsx376,I feel like this should be considered a form of torture or at least some type of bribery or extortion or something. This is on par with advertisements hijacking your computer and not letting you use it until you pay them to stop playing ads.
dwmvifi,CubonesDeadMom,So a school system scammed money of off their unemployed students by making them miserable? The principal or super intendant should have taken a pay cut if they needed money
dwmx2x4,Charaids,"Gotta test our torture methods on American citizens first before we try it out in Guantanamo.Thanks high school kids for making America a safer place, like when you absorb all those bullets."
dwmxc80,thespritewithin,"We tried this exact same thing at my school, and the student body was threatening to sue the school for cruel and unusual punishment. Needless to say the song stopped in about 3 days and we didn't raise any money."
dwmylcf,KisukeUraharaHat,Imagine if they received sufficient funding for supplies and extracurricular activities instead so they didn't have to do this.
dwmejtq,brianx87,"This can't be legal, it's extortion if I'm not mistaken?"
dwmg392,MarshmallowBlue,I will make it legal.
dwmaxg3,royalbarnacle,Plot twist: then the school was sued and had to pay $1 million for unauthorized broadcasting.
dwmeewq,bth31383,Taking a page out of the ATF's “What we did in Waco” play book. Surprised the school didn't burn down.
dwmf2nb,AintGotNoBrakes,Even the Chicago school district is crooked. Shaking down kids for money. What a shithole.
dwmf4ht,Birdkid10,My high school tried this. It lasted one block till several teachers sent emails in saying they would walk out if they didn't stop.

dwmfiih,panchovilla_,"my highschool did this with Hansen's ""M-Bop"". It was called, ""Stop the Bop"". I don't even remember what they were raising money for but I always thought it might be considered a light form of torture. I think the school eventually stopped due to complaints"

dwmfqan,elizabethcorinne,My school did the same thing but didn't raise nearly as much
dwmfryv,CAT_WILL_MEOW,"People did this at my highschool with kids bop songs, problem was our speakers was shit so it was just white noise nobody gave a shit about, in order to look successful an “anymonous” doner donated 1-2 grand"
dwmfs4x,nitasu987,My high school (suburbs of Chicago) played Never Gonna Give You Up or whatever the actual title is every day between periods for a week for a fundraiser for Homecoming or something iirc. It was pretty funny because I actually enjoyed the song.
dwmfw2i,muffinnosnuthin,Your school rick rolled you?
dwmgbcd,nitasu987,Yep. For a whole week. And it was AWESOME.
dwmhtmf,muffinnosnuthin,I love Rick Astley bought his cassette and listened all the time...when it was new.

dwmg1ve,ArMcK,That's child abuse.
dwmg5gn,Shronkydonk,Extortion?
dwmg5k9,ChiselFish,"My school did that with some Alvin and the Chipmunks sing, and the student body was so pissed at being extorted that we never finished the fundraiser. A teacher had to give the last $300."
dwmgcw1,DLTMIAR,"We did the opposite of that at my h.s., but had to stop after like a week bc the songs slowly kept getting more and more inappropriate"
dwmgd96,Dazanos27,My school played its a barbie girl during lunch at full blast for a month. They only stopped it after raising 3k for hurricane victims.

dwmgtxu,disteriaa,"Our school did: ""The song that never ends... It's just goes on and on my friend. Some people started singing it not knowing what it was... And we'll continue singing it forever just because."" On repeat. 50x a day. All to encourage kids to donate cans. Drove us all mad."
dwmgw8r,oddshouten,"Reminds me of “stop the bop”Same concept, with Hanson's “MmmBop”"

dwmhn01,ExpertFldMedic,Also taught kids psychology effects positive punishment in operant conditioning.

dwmhskz,NC_EER,I feel like this is really similar to one of the first episodes of Black Mirror.
dwmncrm,autopawn,Fifteen Million Merits?
dwneqqz,NC_EER,That's the one. The people had to pay to turn off unavoidable advertising.
dwmi2rw,happy_beluga,My high school (graduate 2005) used to play Avril Lavigne and that horrible horrible song about girls who wear Abercrombie and Fitch.No wonder I wanted to kill myself.
dwmieo0,isc9my5c,Imagine how much more the school could raise if they played songs like “Friday “.
dwmjcdy,Holzy09,"They tried that with Bob the builder at my high school. After two days, they raised no money and no one was allowed to play anything. It almost started fights"
dwmjkku,dbculli20,In a Chicago high school? So like robbing the poor to pay the poor?
dwmjqsl,MajesticBacon_,My school does that too but the problem is that the songs they choose arent too bad so I think they raised ~$12.
dwmjs29,Dyl000,"They did the same thing with “What Does the Fox Say” a few years back, played the annoying bits over and over again, backfired though, everyone refused to give them a cent. They raised $50 after a week"
dwmjyqv,Scubamesteve,It's the no headphones in school policy that had a clear effect here. Otherwise this would have gone unnoticed.
dwmk65i,DarthCallsMeDaddy,That's literally extortion.
dwmkm1r,ShittyAnalysisGuy,This is why they shoot people in Chicago
dwmknv9,shanster925,"So, they did this at my high school for a dance. They called it ""stop the bop"" and every day until they sold x number of tickets, they played Hanson's Mmmbop at breaks and lunch.It had the opposite effect, because all the students were irritated and refused to give in to such a stupid ploy.The dance was cancelled due to low sales."
dwmkx73,eeman0201,"My school did something like this once. Kinda actually made me not want to donate, so they get the idea to not play annoying songs."
dwmkxlc,myjmp99,My school did this with “what does the fox say”. They had to stop when the special needs students starting slamming their heads into walls and desks cause it was driving them mad...
dwmky2v,b-marie,Why exactly is the school trying to raise money from high school students? Do high school students have money?
dwmmjpf,ChocktawRidge,They did something like this to Noriega in Panama.
dwmn5v2,TurboAbe,r/latestagecapitalism
dwmn6o0,Meadmanmike,When I was in high school the student government used a similar tactic. They played Hansen's Mmmbop during lunch period for a month. We didn't give those bastards a dime.
dwmn9qp,actualspacepirate,"My high school does something similar, except they use different songs for every bell and they just do it for fun/to torture us. If I hear “Uptown Girl” one more time I'm going to fucking lobotomize myself."

dwmot6x,dca570,"That is called ""torture"".I would STOP coming to school, or wear ear plugs ALL DAY, and then the school could take it up with MY PARENTS."

dwmsq93,Tired8281,Training the next generation of psychopathic CEOs!
dwmtubz,oeynhausener,That's torture
dwmv0xu,unique616,"My school had the ""health walk"". If you paid $20, you got to walk to the multi-million dollar football stadium, eat greasy pizza, and leave early from school. The money went to help the football team. If you didn't pay, then you got to do busy work in class for the rest of the day. It was similar to what ISS (in school suspension) was like."
dwmvm9e,SpeedySlowpoke,My school did something similar. They called it stop the bop. Played the Hansen brothers non stop. Most kids just put their headphones on.
dwmx579,TheKwatos,"Are you fucking serious, this world fucking sucks because of money"

dwngwh3,Macasnack,"My highschool tried this, they made 20 dollars. And then they stopped doing it after a few days."
dwni2zk,cajunrevenge,I thought torture was illegal? What did they sell for the fundraiser? Ear plugs?
dwnklla,Jaitnium,All you need to do is contact the record agency and let them know your school is playing their music for profit without a license. That'll get them to stop *real* fucking fast.
dwnqwdj,robotman5_,"They did that at my high school also, fucking hell it was annoying."
dwmausf,DoubleTrigga,My high school did the same thing but we played that EIFFEL 65 song Blue (De Ba De). It was horrible...
dwmp4s0,whitestrice1995,That song is fire tho

dwmaw39,BigPaul1e,"The high school my dad taught at was *huge*, and it was taking them forever to make sure all the kids cleared out at the end of the day. The principal's solution was to blast ""Don't Worry, Be Happy"" over the PA system at the end of the day.They didn't have a problem with kids hanging around after that."
dwmfhyn,Stalked_Like_Corn,I probably woulda stuck around to hear the song. I love that song. Not my favorite by Bobby but certainly a good one.
dwmb8s9,TheFiredrake42,I like that solution.
dwmea9m,jcrc,My high school does something like this every year. When I was there it was Mmmbop. “Stop the Bop 2010” IIRC! We always raised quite a bit for project graduation this way.

dwme7nq,Safar1Man,Yeah that isn't illegal or anything
dwm94od,silenceisred,Live in Chicago area. We had the same event fundraiser and our school did the same thing literally the day after Evanston. Except we did it for a whole week regardless.

dwmf4hy,mutilatedrabbit,"Apart from the obvious question as to why they're hitting up kids for money, I just have one thing to ask: How did they raise anywhere near $1,000? That must have been one rich and/or desperate kid."
dwmf4wy,SymphonicStorm,"When I was in high school they did a week like this where they played Mmm-Bop at lunch, and we had to raise a certain amount to stop it. Everyone either didn't care, or leaned into it and pretended to enjoy the music."
dwmf7xe,mrstevemrsteve,"My old high school did this exact thing with the Barney ""I love you, you love me"" song"
dwmf823,Mikegull,"They did this in my high school over a decade ago, except they used Hanson's mmmbop. Stuff of nightmares, I tell ya."
dwmfamb,ThatFlappingTerror,"Anyone remember *The Drew Carey Show*? This reminds me of the episodes when Winfred Louder bought out Drew's neighborhood and half his house (which they took)for expansion and Drew refused to sell the other half, so Mr. Wick let Mimi try to drive Drew and his friends out. She put up stadium lights and loudspeakers and played some music...first, it was Panama, by Van Halen. Then, it was Panama, by Van Halen. Followed by that, it was Panama, by Van Halen!"
dwmfb0x,figuresys,This is how you know you overreact to songsEdit: not talking about music being used as torture
dwmfdd7,Icanberoberta,A group in my high school did this with Hansen's mmm bop. Mmm bop makes me something something.
dwmfh52,Piltonbadger,"I would class that as torture, on par with water boarding."
dwmfh88,RichHomieJake,They did this when I was in high school with What Does the Fox Say.
dwmfil8,Lavalamp44,I had the same thing when I was in high school. It was called stop the bop. They continually played mmmbop by Hansen until enough money was raised.
dwmfkgz,_________FU_________,That shouldn't be possible unless they made multiple students pay the money.
dwmfkkd,danielleflocka,"There are so many worse songs they could have chosen, Justin Bieber was actually a hit. I would've paid to tune out Rebecca Black or any other UNtalented nonsense"
dwmflaa,cheesewaster,"My middle school tortured us with the Journey song “Don't Stop Believin'” for two months. I still hate that song, and I'm in my 20's."
dwmfnvx,Tsobaphomet,sort of a dick move
dwmfpn1,The_Plotblocker,Surely that is child abuse at the highest level
dwmfqg4,mellywheats,This happened at some other school but they played friday by rebecca black instead
dwmfqho,TEAMSnorlax,"I went to this high school. So glad they did this after I graduated, I dont know if my depressed teenage self could have handled it"
dwmfrh2,Cloud6556,Isn't there some rule about cruel and unusual punishments?
dwmft4d,thepinebaron,Similar thing happened to me and my school during all lunch periods. Hanson - Mmmbop was the weapon of choice. Very effective.
dwmfutx,monkeyofdoom4324,They did this shit in our high school but they played who let the dogs out 😑
dwmfv59,drjallz,First you play the bieber. Then you get the money. Then you get the power.
dwmfwed,SirEarlBigtitsXXVII,I would have brought my high powered sound system and started blasting 80s thrash metal.
dwmg032,the-almighty-savior,They did the same thing at my high school but with Hanson's M BOP...

dwmg3aa,ArtsBeeBunny,"My Highschool did something like this but with ""The song that never ends"" from Lambchop's Play Along"
dwmg3aq,sold_snek,Not even in college yet and they're already paying their schools.
dwmg3tx,grizzlybear1337,"My high school did this, but they played ""MMMBOP"" by Hanson. The fundraiser was called ""Stop the Bop"", and it didn't work as well. It took forever to reach the money goal because many students actually liked the song."
dwmg6sy,ThePancakeChair,The band members had to be there the whole time. Perhaps they suffered the most.
dwmg7b8,DarkKitarist,That. Is. GENIUS!
dwmh1i4,decitronal,*torture
dwmg7qf,Dicethrower,"It's completely in style with Bieber himself too. Surely not everyone in the school hates it, and surely not everyone donates just to stop the songs, but they're all talking about it. Depending on someone's personality they'll have a different opinion about it and thanks to the facebook generation everyone thinks their opinion must be heard and expressed. All they need is for kids to talk about it, good or bad, and it'll be the trending topic at that time, which is the best kind of awareness you can create."
dwmg7zk,alittleofcolumnAandB,"Hey! My school did this too, except it was the band and they kept playing ""Please Don't Stop the Music"" by Rihanna over the loudspeakers"
dwmg8ml,drwzr,My high school did this with mmmbop. Similar results
dwmg8pa,Fuzzlechan,"My high school played ""Mmbop"" by Hansen. I was very disappointed when that fundraising campaign ended."
dwmgglw,Mmaibl1,I thought listening to Justin Bieber (forced or otherwise) was banned by the Geneva Convention.
dwmggtn,werekitty93,"My high school did this for about 3 days. First day it was ""Friday"" by Rebecca Black, then ""Baby"", then ""The Hamster Dance"". The latter didn't get money to be turned off because everyone actually enjoyed it. People started dancing on the tables so the teachers had it shut off. They didn't continue after that"
dwmghu9,kno_da_wae,"They did that at our school except they played ""Happy"" by Pharell."
dwmgj4o,mojojojo31,Now don't go giving people ideas

dwmgrm0,epic82,They would love my Ontario license plate BEBR H8R
dwmgv21,arsehole2mods,We did terrible music week at school. We had to raise so much for it to stop. Bieber was played alot.
dwmgvmw,K8088,To make even more money they should pipe hello kitty into the office nonstop until they make 2 more thousand! See how the freak show running the school likes it!
dwmgw8g,beanieb22,That's cruel and unusual punishment.
dwmgwnr,deadmoscow,Negative reinforcement!!

dwmh45o,Heyitsj1337,"Did the same at mine, ours wasn't so good..."
dwmh531,viper12a1a,I wear earphones most of the time so...
dwmh6xw,CreatrixAnima,That sounds more like extortion a fundraising event.
dwmh93p,Cosmic_Fugue,"How the hell is that legal? Even if it's a stupid threat, it's still a threat made for the express purpose of obtaining money from the victims."
dwmh94l,reeferkeefer024,"They did this in my high school as well, suburbs of chicago, only during lunch, I unplugged the laptop but after 10 seconds they plugged it back in"
dwmhajo,DamivicMcSecsyi,My high school did the same thing with the Caillou theme song... en français
dwmhcna,I-_-II,This explains all the school shootings.
dwmhcuu,-dorian-gray-,"My school did this with “tiptoe through the tulips,” except they fucked up and played it during the lunchtime classes because the lunchtime classes were split periods. After that they had to stop because a bunch of kids had to try to finish tests to the stylings of Tiny Tim"
dwmhepq,imbex,I would sabotage the sound system and be a hero to all!! I'd be suspended too.
dwmhfdv,meth_amphetamine,So they just annoy the shit out of kids until they get their money? What the fuck is wrong with them.
dwmhh00,twgecko02,Is reddit fucking with the upvotes numbers for April fools?
dwmhhqo,cjbrigol,Ha my school did this with mmmbop back in like 2006. Everyone loved it so no one donated
dwmhtsy,themarkster09,Did we go to the same school?
dwmj1w0,cjbrigol,I'd rather not find out lmao
dwmhi73,ccchopstixxx,One of my local radio stations does a Make A Wish Foundation drive and only plays “Over and Over” by Nelly and Tim McGraw until each kid get their wish.
dwmhiqc,ccchopstixxx,I should add that it goes on for about 3 days
dwmhiqk,ZamsTheTank,My high school played football players mix tapes in the halls on Fridays and I really wish I could have paid 1k to make it stop.
dwmhkus,recycleddesign,Shut up and take my 💰
dwmhnp6,teachky89,It was Feliz Navidad at my high school.
dwmhosz,GIANT316,That's always a psychological warfare method...except they don't pay....
dwmhp64,kongpin,The Geneva convention would like a word with you.
dwmht8o,morecupcakethanhuman,That's amazing
dwmhtfa,LordIlthari,"My school did something similar a few years ago, except it played “It's a Small World”, at ear rape volume."
dwmhw6d,AnnaMPiranha,This is what I do when my children won't get up for school. It stops when they get in the shower.
dwmhxdg,emilyMartian,I did this with karaoke once. I'm REALLY bad and was at a fundraiser that wasn't hitting the numbers they needed so I gave them the idea. They raised the goal amount in under 2 minutes
dwmhxl6,Zebrog,They did this when I was in college. They would blast Hanson's ‘mmm bop' and have us pay for it to be off. $1 per minute. It was called stop the bop.
dwmhyzz,tylerPA007,My high school did exactly this except with Friday by Rebecca Black!
dwmi1z2,KickballJesus,So about $0.50 a student? They probably would have done that in 3 days for any fundraising campaign.
dwmi2w7,LivingDead199,"They did this with ""Banana Phone"" in my high school."
dwmi39p,SHABOtheDuke,My school did this with “mmm bop” by Hanson but they shut it down after a month when nobody paid anything
dwmi3la,Warpimp,"I'm sick of schools trying to pump thier own students for money. Between this and those stupid candy bar sales, I am ready to lose my shit. Seriously, the only time in our lives where money isn't paramount is childhood, can we at least let kids have that?"
dwmi3vr,pagadqs,"They made students pay not to listen to Bieber ? And you call that fundraising technique ? Whoever moron came up with that should be instantly fired, you can't extort students like that , they are there for education, and don't have an income to begin with, what kind of a messed up plan is that ? Worst school and healthcare system in the world..."
dwmi4r8,xalyssam,"Our school did this almost every year I was there. I believe we had Barbie Girl, Hamster Dance and Mmm Bop. It's a pretty fucked up idea to get kids to raise money"
dwmi7if,bestbainkr,Yeeeeaaa That's illegal as fuck
dwmi8dn,doinsublime,This sounds suspiciously like torture and extortion. Welcome to America in 2018.
dwmi8k7,zerob_directv,These TIL are getting mediocre.
dwmiaft,buttMastersInc,Best....highschool....EVER!
dwmibm7,DukeOfMusicstan,They should have pretended they liked it.
dwmie0k,RelentlesslyAnnoying,"My high school did this with Mmmbop by Hanson. They called the campaign ""Stop the Bop"". It was literal hell."
dwmiehc,infinitefoamies,Has nobody heard of headphones?
dwmiita,CymbalKrash3,Psychological warfare to raise money. Nice. I think I would have lasted longer on the Spice Girls than Bieber though.
dwmij7k,W_ORhymeorReason,This is cruel and unusual punishment.
dwmikvm,rtmpower,They did this at my high school with M'Bop. They stopped when kids started destroying the hallway speakers
dwmimoi,treskatay,"Well they made students parents pay. Most high schoolers don't earn their own money, and for those that do what a dick move asking for it."
dwmiokr,GR00607,Future politicians.
dwmips0,HighlyRefinedPirate_,That sounds super illegal
dwmiq6y,whales_in_space,This happened at my school but during lunch periods. They stopped when kids started printing out and taping the definition of ‘extortion' to the door of the teacher's classroom who organized it.
dwmiqhl,Shamic,I feel the kids did this just because it's popular to hate on beiber. It's not any worse than most other pop music
dwmiruc,the1ancha11,Mine did it with Friday back when that was a thing.
dwmis4d,A-aron52,My school does the same thing except it's at Christmas and the song is Dominic the donkey. It's fun at first but then it's a nightmare
dwmituw,swifferlifterupper,My school did this with mm bop.
dwmix8o,LateralusNYC,"Mine too! They called it ""Stop the Bop!"" ...WCHS?"
dwmivxk,mrkyle330,"We did the same thing, but with What Does the Fox Say"
dwmiwie,HybridHerald,My high school did this too (with other annoying music) during fundraisers. It's pretty darn manipulative.
dwmix6s,darthfruitbasket,"My high school student council did this, but with ""Ice Ice Baby."" The *teachers* ultimately gave them whatever amount they wanted to make them stop."
dwmix7h,HockeyD53,We did this at my school too! Why aren't we in the news?
dwmiz1g,Not_Just_A_Nerd,"So the school that my high school was ""Rivals"" with was the one they are talking about here.The amount of creativity people were using to try and ignore it was crazy.Ear plugs and all kinds of shit"
dwmizld,lenoresbeadsman,My school used to play Hanson's “Mmm Bop.” That one works too :3
dwmj16e,CarsenAF,It's great that in the US students have to find schools
dwmj17h,coconutt15,Our school used to play Mmbop by Hanson until all students cleared the halls and got into class. If students were wandering the halls it would continue playing. It worked.
dwmj2do,DeathByCheetos,"We did this in high school in 2002. If I remember right the songs were Mmmbop by Hanson, Blue by Eiffel 65, and at least one more.Students got to donate to remove each song on a ballot. I don't remember a lot of the other details, but it was an effective fundraiser."
dwmj2to,elxavi82,I am not sure if that was entrepreneurship or extortion 🤔
dwmj431,NLWoody,What a shithole country
dwmj4c2,Voidsabre,I thought Obama banned torture
dwmj4ft,Insteadofsleeping,"Yeah, went to this high school when this happened. I think I donated like 20 bucks, it was so fucking annoying. We used to have one song play during one passing period on Friday as the seniors song and it was always some obscure song. Our class song was Alabama's I'm in a Hurry."
dwmj4lq,Grendel84,"My highschool did the same thing but with the Macarena, and I swear it was 2 or 3 weeks."
dwmj5kr,Marky_Marco,I'm surprised they didn't raise more
dwmj5ky,spinningmoon,"They did this in my high school in 2006ish, but the song they played was MMMbop.Except we all started the Electric Slide (no joke) in the cafeteria after a couple of weeks because we were all too cheap and stubborn to donate."
dwmj6vz,LowestKDgaming,They did that to us with the *Friday* song by Vanessa Black or whoever wrote that song. **pure cancer**
dwmj79z,JoeZMar,"When I was in high school my school played The Hustle on a loop until our school hit a specific amount. It lasted 3 weeks and was only stopped when the cafeteria workers banded together to pay the fundraiser off because the students heard it between classes and during 1 lunch period, but in the cafeteria it never turned off because there was no classroom around the cafeteria."
dwmj832,CoolJoey99,I thought this was a joke
dwmj884,jaydenpaul,My high school did this with the Christmas song Dominick The Donkey in an effort to raise money. Before they were able to reach their fundraising goal. They had to stop playing the song as a special needs student had a mental breakdown from it!Link to song : https://youtu.be/hYlvfX3nwlc
dwmj8mc,Jezon,Sounds like tourture to me. Wouldn't even be legal to do to prisoners xD
dwmj9bk,swagoli,Our high school did this with The song Friday. I loved hearing it in the washrooms and library all day.
dwmjb8e,badtwinboy,"Funny how you're told to act like an adult in high school, and yet the adults in charge pull childish behavior like this. If you want high schoolers to act like adults, then treat them with a level of respect."
dwmjdoe,KJ6BWB,How much did they charge per stop?
dwmjdyc,Theawoop,How is that legal what the fuck.
dwmje77,awfulunlawfulfalafel,This happened at my high school except it was ‘Mmm Bop' by Hansen
dwmjeta,aspoels,"My school just plays songs in between classes. First half of the year it was Viva la vida by Coldplay, now it's ok walking on sunshine. Fuck that, fuck them jt fuckig sucks"
dwmjfn2,llxxvxxll,I upvoted this until I read the article and found out wasn't an actual CPS school
dwmjhdc,Hagel-Kaiser,"My school did this with other songs. On Friday though, they played Rebecca Black's 'Friday'"
dwmjjdw,Tarponio,So torture.
dwmjjw8,thepittstop,This is my favorite thing
dwmjjyh,chillmanstr8,Sounds awfully similar to the fake story about a guy who's cell played that and got a bear to stop attacking him.
dwmjl06,CH0C0RAM0,Our school played the song in the hallways to get us to class... song wasn't played inside the classrooms.
dwmjogs,spookyghostface,A school I worked at tried that with What the Fox Say. They raised zero dollars and canceled the fundraiser on the second day.
dwmjp10,AnneFranksDaddy,"My high school also tried that, but our math teacher decided enough was enough and beat one of the lockers repeatedly with his fists until it was fucked like a football bat. He took a couple days off after that."
dwmjpn3,Origamipi,My school tried to do this. It lasted nearly a month because nobody was willing to pay. Eventually the teachers got fed up and made them stop playing it.
dwmjqog,CaptainHalitosis,They did this at my high school and vowed not to stop until they raised the money. People were annoyed and didn't donate and they played the song for about 3 months.
dwmjr7o,_Carmines,"We did this when I was in high school, the song was mm bop by Hansen."
dwmjrcy,clueless3867,"My school did this with Mmmbop. The fundraiser was called ""Stop the Bop""."
dwmjs3y,StephenGrimes,I was unlucky enough to be in highschool during the era in which these songs came out. They played them in the hall ways all the time. That and apple bottom jeans boots with the fur.
dwmjuvu,Phrasing101,This just a sadistic fundraiser. Well done.
dwmjvec,ENEMiG0,lol DAE justin beiber is le sux and gay!! XD! updoot!
dwmjy4i,treslor,"My high school did this with ""Mmmbop"". Still didn't convince anyone to give enough of a shit to donate so it went on for months."
dwmk069,Ihateyouandeveryone,this is similar to what the US did to pow's in Guantanamo.
dwmk0z9,Raspberryian,Our school did that too. A couple of seniors did that exact same thing to raise money for their senior trip. Our school isn't in Chicago. That was the worst two weeks of my life. They only ended up with $250 because we just put our headphones on between classes.
dwmk1pa,_Badeo,"My school did this with the Chicken Dance, and around 10 or so dollars were donated."
dwmk38i,Jonerr,"Me: ""I have never heard one of Justin Beiber's songs""Friend: ""you've never heard Baby""Me: ""That's Justin Beiber?""Other guy: ""That's a man?"""
dwmk500,Skylinens,"I remember this at my junior high in Chicago, holy shit. Reality is so strange"
dwmk6kc,jojobean516,This was my high school. Spoiler alert: BooCoo still closed.
dwmk93e,FyreTango,My school did this exact same thing except they played Dominic the Donkey. Money was raised in no time.
dwmka9v,Zingeronix,My HS did this every year!
dwmkadk,lllegirl,"MAN I'm glad to have not been born in the US. Not only am I not shot, I also don't have to listen to Beiber."
dwmkc0q,swifferlifterupper,"No my school was in Mo, HHS."
dwmkcts,PugK9Unit,It took them 3 days? I would have donated the full $1000 after the first 5 seconds to get it to stop
dwmkehl,quartzquandary,We did this at my undergrad in college. They made a bunch of money
dwmkf46,FourChannel,"Wow, it sounds like I got out of high school before all the bullshit really hit the fan.Graduated in 2004."
dwmkf50,Neebay,That is messed up on multiple levels.
dwmkhr7,buckybear1985,My school did this once but they used the Barney song. It was very effective.
dwmkhxs,leel007,It's that exstortion?
dwmkixx,hitthewallrunning,That's duress!
dwmkjlg,Sir_Meow,My School did this with the Hamster dance and Hansons MMmm Bop
dwmkjnr,I_Broke_Wind,"If the music doesn't stop in 15 minutes, they're legally allowed to leave."
dwmkkvb,TheRealMouseRat,How can this be legal?
dwmklgm,JohnnyDarkside,"Hard for me seeing such a big problem, but my high school had block scheduling so there were only 4 classes a day meaning I'd only hear it 3 times. Even then, there's only like 3 or 4 minutes between classes. I really don't see any reason anyone would really pay except the rich kids who ask their parents for money."
dwmkwq8,nut-sack,"Dang 4? We had home room, then 3 classes in the morning, lunch and then 4 more."
dwmm674,JohnnyDarkside,"For English and history class it was almost torture because they felt so long, but for science and gym it was so much better. For science it was so great because when you had labs it felt like you only would get like 15 minutes after everything was setup and explained."
dwoaugs,nut-sack,"To facilitate at least some of that our schedule was complicated af. Each day was a new letter until you got up to G(then it started back at A). On say D day, you had gym, so 2 of your non-core classes would get cut that day, and you would go to gym. Same with science lab. They would cut whatever non-core class was after your normal science class, and instead you would go to the lab for both."
dwocag0,JohnnyDarkside,Jesus. We had just a and b. That's nonsense and I don't understand how anyone would think that was a good idea.
dwocf64,nut-sack,"Im not sure how they even made schedules for this many people to work. Oh, and seniors get there an hour earlier, because they have a class before home room. That way, they can get out one class earlier than the rest of the school. But if you were even 3 minutes late, they had this teacher who would sit next to the only unlocked door to give you detention. Which meant you waited past that last class, before you even started serving detention."
dwmkmay,paranoid_giraffe,That's some serious psychological warfare
dwmkqh9,Mattiason,My old high school did the same thing with the six flags theme song back in 2013.
dwmkqjn,pieman531,Those monsters 😱
dwmkrd4,TookMeDerbs,That's my school
dwmkupq,dboy2093,My high school did this as well back in 2010
dwmkuu6,EyeGuy98,Brainwash them into pursuing greed early. Breaks them down into nihilism over time. That's the agenda.
dwmkvo2,Rabidsolution,"Our high school did this with the Barbie song. No one gave money, they eventually just stopped playing it as it was a lost cause"
dwmkw69,dax552,April Fool's?
dwmkwdx,Toastmaster3000,"My high school did this years ago with Hanson's MMMbop, calling the campaign ""Stop the Bop"".I don't remember the actual figure we raised, but it was also wildly successful."
dwmkwuq,tacofeet,"My high school did this with Mmmmbop in the late 90s. It was called ""stop the bop"". Fastest fundraiser ever."
dwmkzo5,MagicFritz,step 1) `burn down school`
dwml2g9,CausaPatet,My high school did a similar thing but with Hanson's 'Mm-bop'.
dwml45y,ManuPasta,Did the school pay licensing to pay for the song to be played?
dwml5dg,anothermanoutoftime,"God, I'm so old. My high school did this with NKOTB, but they played it *during* class. My physics teacher calmly hopped up on a stool, disconnected the speaker, got back down and continued where he left off."
dwml72k,BizGilwalker,"My high school did this with Mmmbop.The word ""Mmmbop"" now makes me annoyed"
dwml7km,trusty20,ITT People pretending the school chained students to chairs with speakers playing music day and night until students paid to get out. MUH GENEVA CONVENTIONThey replaced the super loud drawn out tone with a 30 second clip of Baby. Annoying? Sure but people could have easily committed and it would be background noise in a week tops.
dwml7vq,jadage,So this is what it feels like to get your shit reposted. Huh.
dwml81t,cole93747,"My high school did that for Spirit week, same cause. Like $500 to make that day's song stop. Next day, new song"
dwmlakn,pieman7414,"My school did that too, fun"
dwmlbfy,SteevyT,Isn't that considered a form of torture?
dwmlcz3,gumbystruck,"They tried doing this with mmmbop by Hansen at my high school, it backfired on them big time. We all just ended up dancing to it in the halls on the way to class. It went on for a few weeks until the faculty complained too much about the music. We were all sad that they stopped playing the song cause we couldn't dance anymore."
dwmle7o,LavenderTed,Why? Is that school short on funding? Unusual.
dwmle7y,DoctorFeuer,They did it at my school with Wannabe by the Spice Girls. They normally got pretty good donations without any coercion but this time they got practically none because nobody was donating out of spite.
dwmlflr,NovarisLight,"That's cruel and unusual punishment.dusty beaver should never be played, ever."
dwmlkyx,EpicRainbow_,My school did this with the same song. I don't think anyone ended up donating and everyone was pissed.
dwmll3k,honorman81,Sounds like extortion to me.
dwmlm2j,Kaderade13,"I posted to r/legaladvice because my school did this with what's the fox say, every morning, in between each class, and during lunch. They called it ""Stop the Fox."" I fucking hated school."
dwmlmpv,justgarcia31,"My school tried this but except played it on the intercom during class too ... teachers weren't happy and students had no money, and so the song stopped playing before we even got to lunch."
dwmlnb5,itwasdark,"What the fuck, they shook down their own students? At least go for people with jobs, or better yet the bosses of those people."
dwmlnhn,ITmongoose,My school would play barney's i love you in the halls for a fundraiser.
dwmlnqc,TKLeader,"My high school did that ALL DAY like 6 or so years ago with that ""Friday"" song by Rebecca black. I literally left and skipped most of that day.I skipped a lot back then though."
dwmlo2d,Collard-Greens,We did this too back in high school. It was like punishing a bunch of kids for no reason and making them pay to make it stop
dwmlout,mkt3,Lol yall are way overreacting to how bad a song is. You probably wouldn't even hate it so much if it wasn't already widely hated. Think for yourself. This is group polarization in a nutshell.
dwmlpby,Moral_Gutpunch,Reminds of an old comic. A street vendors has a table and a boom box and a sign that says 'will not play Christmas carols for $$$' and people are tripping over each other to give him money.
dwmlpiq,theTAUSonMangoSt,Our Chicago high school (Northside Prep) did it first...several years ago!
dwmlrdq,CineKayla,My school did this with 'Friday' at lunch. I ate in the library that week.
dwmlspj,Daisyleaf6,"I went to that school. (It's in Evanston, not Chicago.) A couple years later they did the same thing with “The Fox”. They may have also done “Friday”, but I'm unsure about that one."
dwmlui7,killakhmer773,Evanston* a Chicago suburb
dwmlvdv,AntoLino11,Our school does this sometimes but we can't pay to stop it
dwmlw7v,kixxx_troll,"This is hilarious. My high school did this with "" Barbie Girl"" by Aqua. Goal was 1000, after a week we raised about 250ish, not even close, and only raising minimal amounts daily. Students were signing petitions by the end of week two to end the madness."
dwmlwz3,FreeSpeechIsCancer,we did the same but with mmbop by Hanson.
dwmlybo,reyajavik,At my high school they blared that “Happy” song as a fundraising technique. The student body was so apathetic about it. The office said they were going to play it until the senior class debt was paid off. After three days the secretaries in the office had gone crazy and stopped the music.
dwmlykc,MichiganMacintosh,"Our school did this with Rebecca Black's Friday for about half a week, until it received too many complaints from the staff and they had to stop."
dwmm4zu,DisplayUserName,"I would never admit it in public, but I actually like that song."
dwmm5d3,paradox8493,"Torture is illegal in America. That's why we do it in black sites! Also, pretty sure that was blackmail or something else also illegal. I'd sue that school. I also would just leave the second it started playing, and not go back until it stopped."
dwmm5fx,Agentcat007,Why just 3 days? Because they finally got smart and went to the source. The person playing JB has yet to be found.
dwmm6it,felipecc,Extortion and auditive kidnapping. That principal belongs in jail.
dwmm6k8,Xerox748,"This was my school! Technically not Chicago, it's Evanston, the first suburb north of Chicago.The headline here is very misleading. It wasn't the administration's idea. This was organized by students and the money was raised for a non profit that gave free music classes and provided a free recording studio time to people in the community. Playing music between classes was already really common, and this was sort of a “Hey, we know you hate this song too, help us provide resources for people who otherwise couldn't afford it, to make better music” Evanston has always been very supportive of the arts and especially music, is no exception.Also, to really put this in context, you need to understand the demographics of the school. The population of the entire school, students and staff, was over 5000 people. And it was a fairly well off community. Not super rich, but fairly well off. Most of my friends all got cars for their 16th birthdays, or graduation. I graduated with a kid who was **Personally** worth over $40 Million (Dad died in a skiing accident). So for these 5000+ people to scrape together $1000 wasn't a monumental task by any means.Go Wildkits!"
dwmm86x,nelly1234567,My school did the same but someone actually paid $500 to change it to the little Einstein's theme. It also played all day long (through classes too)
dwmmac8,paidbythekill,"Didn't realize this was done elsewhere. My high school did the exact same thing except it was ""Baby"", ""Mmm Bop"", and ""Friday"".It was terrible, everyone hated it, and they apparently got their fundraising money."
dwmmb2n,PositiveLions,If this had happened in my school there'd have been no loudspeakers left by day 3
dwmmbio,morningsdaughter,"My high school tried this with that crazy frog song, but everyone liked it too much and it was much longer than the break period so it didn't feel like a constant repeat. After a couple weeks try changed it to so remix of a baby laughing(that made it sound like the baby was being beaten...) And that was too annoying so we protested by not giving any money. I think the faculty put a stop to it after a week."
dwmmbk6,haventanywater,"This is great! they did this in my school during lunch to raise money but used the song mmmm bop by Hanson. Guess I am showing my age a bit 😂 One dollar to turn it off, one dollar to turn it on."

dwmmbt8,Gjonesy3,Do this with Luis fonsi songs and you can open a new space center
dwmmcn9,Dudelyllama,For a food drive my school played Mmmbop by Hanson between periods. I think it took a couple days for us to get about 500 pounds or more of canned food.
dwmmctt,cube-tube,We did that with what does the fox say
dwmmdie,camelCaseCoffeeTable,"Shit my high school did the same thing, played Baby during lunch, every day for a month, from the beginning until enough money had been raised for that day. Played it so loud you could barely talk. It was effective hahah"

dwmmnrb,KubrickIsMyCopilot,"No matter how mild or funny, it is literally extortion. They treated their students as prey rather than people they're meant to serve.Do that shit at city council meetings until they budget the damn school money they're supposed to."
dwmmpq5,KnewItWouldHappen,The student council at my highschool did this exact thing to raise money as well. The money was supposed to go towards the school but they used it to go on a ski trip. A lot of kids learned about extortion that day.
dwmmqda,toxicforsure,My school did a similar thing but they played the little Einstein's trap remix for 4 hours straight
dwmmqv6,Ducttape03,This happen at my school with the Hamster Dance. My brother and myself started a petition over the 4 week period it was on. We got almost a 1000 signatures and had to present it at the school board and the school district shut it down and made sure it never happened again. (2011)
dwmmrp3,EpicSlothToes,"Both high schools in the town I went to did this, turned into a joke and everyone would act pumped in the halls, almost no students donated. One teacher paid the last half of the goal because it was pissing him off"
dwmmrw1,steakncheese1,"All of these MPAA violations. Think of all the free money the MPAA could have made off the tax dollars, Also audible torture is used in war. Why are we using it on our children?"

dwmmue8,quantumlyrandomuser,that's how ads on freemium apps work
dwmmuey,BloodshotMoon,That's torture. I would have called the UN.
dwmmuhl,Kurra,My high school did the exact same thing but it was Friday by Rebecca black. I don't think we raised much money though because most days it would stay on all lunch period
dwmmv5z,RAKE_IN_THE_RAPE,My school did this. I started wearing over the ear headphones in the halls.
dwmmw53,bellabutts,"I always hated mandatory donations because my family was on welfare. I didn't want to tell any other kids that, so anything that my family donated came from mine and my brothers piggy bank."

dwmn7s2,Jaylee143,LMFAO genius
dwmn9zo,mail929,I went to another Chicagoland high school that also raised about $1000 in about 3 days doing this. Most of the students refused to donate to stop it. The money was only raised because the principle went out to local businesses to get donations to stop it.
dwmnbdt,GhostoftheMojave,"My school did the exact same thing, but with ""What Does the Fox Say"""
dwmnc8w,sheilamouse4,Turn it against them. Corner the market on ear plugs.
dwmnd62,Lsutigers40,My senior speech did the same thing but with What does the fox say. Let's just say teachers were paying hundreds of dollars before we started playing the song because they were terrified of what we would play.
dwmnew4,noshojones,That should be illegal. Cruel and unusual punishment
dwmnfk2,hoarseclock,Isn't that blackmailing ?
dwmnjzn,RiffFantastic,Sounds more like extortion to me.
dwmodun,hoarseclock,yes that one
dwmnh2x,MagicNein,"My school did this with ""It's a small world"". Lasted a day until someone donated the full amount. I know a ton of students and parents were pissed it even happened at all."
dwmnirx,HtownKS,We did this once. Was moderately successful. Definitely the easiest and cheapest to pull of.
dwmnjx6,ChronophobicGnomon,"My school did this with that awful ‘Dominic the Italian Christmas donkey' song. Go have a listen - just one though. Bonus points for my school: they played it nonstop over lunch, not just passing periods."
dwmnngp,BobokinSlayer,We did this at our high school as well... It was also played during lunch. It was the “Our house.. in the middle of the street” song from some stupid coffee commercial. I think it still took us a full week :/
dwmo50r,TinglingSpideySenses,By Madness?! That song is awesome! The music video for it is pretty funny
dwmo738,BobokinSlayer,"Never seen it. Thanks :) and yeah I didn't mind it at first but it got old reaaaal fast. E: the version we listened to (from the commercial too) is by Crosby, Nash and Stills if I remember correctly. Never heard the original before. Great video though. Kind of reminded me of the video for the Bad Touch by Bloodhound Gang."
dwmwdih,TinglingSpideySenses,"No waaaay the song you're thinking of is ""Our House"" by CSN. It's a totally different song, written acoustically with 3 part harmony. The lyrics for the chorus goes: ""our house, is a very very very fine house (fine house). With two cats in the yard, life used to be so hard, now everything is easy cause of you."" It's a really pretty song, especially given the right environment. The song reminds me of my dad when I was a kid. Whenever we used to go on road trips, looking out at the Midwest scenery, which would just go on forever, we'd listen to 70s rock. CSNY and Jim Croce will always give me the feels. RIP dad. ♥️♥️♥️"
dwn33wh,BobokinSlayer,Welp. well now I'm going to have to google it. I'm fairly certain we're thinking of two separate songs. I may have just mixed up the artist. The one you mentioned I know from How I met your mother and I do think it is a pretty song :) the one I'm thinking of though is from a maxwell coffee commercial.. going to find it and edit my comment. https://youtu.be/bTwL4MqTJokNot the commercial I remember but the song is basically correct. It's a parody of the Madness song. In high school they forced us to listen to the Maxwell coffee version lol.
dwn9olf,TinglingSpideySenses,Anything less than Madness is utter madness!! AHHH Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble! Lol
dwmnobl,dabluebunny,They did this at my school with crazy frog. Idk if they raised much from the kids. Many of us loved that shit lol.
dwmnopa,lingorn,I thought the point was to keep kids in school. I would have just left and never looked back.
dwmnwsx,choppedrice,"My high school did this multiple times. Once it was baby, once it was call me maybe, and there was another but I don't remember the other"
dwmnz85,isaac161000,My high school never played music to get us to donate money. Instead on earth day one year they made us pay $5 to pick up garbage.
dwmo0x7,ZenithMythos,"My high school did the same thing, but with the Gummy Bear song. In different languages every time. Every year I was there for 3 years straight."

dwmo708,travelscout,I imagine they claimed it was cruel and unusual punishment but I would say it served its purpose.
dwmooxf,jas2628,My High School did this with Rebecca Black's Friday. Iirc they kept using it to try to get more and more money past the initial goal.
dwmoqys,wharpudding,My sense of humor has a very abrupt end.I'd have had massive attendance problems during those fund-raisers. They'd be losing out hundreds of dollars in their attempt to try and extort their $1 out of me.
dwmp4jm,dr_oshawott,This happened my 8th grade year in middle school... it was awful. They had teachers stationed every 3 feet to make sure no one had headphones on and if you did they would either confiscate them or force you to take them off.
dwmpah3,gdaem,"My high school did this too, but with Hanson's mmmbop. They called it Stop the Bop.The school raised 1000 dollars in 3 days. Apparently high school kids can only take an annoying song for 3 days before giving in."
dwmq1r2,indyjacob,Local highschool here did same thing. But with All-Star by Smash Mouth. They raised the 2000$ they were aiming for in 4 days.
dwmq2d7,Matt_Zackmann,"Hey, my high school did this too. They did it my sophomore and junior year. Ironically enough, my sophomore year they did Baby, and then the following year they did Friday by Rebecca Black, which was really confusing since they played that one all week..."

dwmqjry,redditsantenna,"My high school did this during our lunch period with the song mmmbop. The school said that it would continue until $1,000 was raised for charity. It started in January at the start of the semester. Nobody paid. NOBODY PAID. We listened to mmmbop on repeat for 4 solid months until the end of the school year."
dwmqt4s,Imtotallycool,"My high school played Barbie girl by Aqua for a couple weeks straight during lunch time. I don't recall the amount they raised but it's pretty genius fundraising techniques, as even I gave them some money to make the music stop."
dwmr6dc,10_Eyes_8_Truths,imagine how much more they could have made with Nickle Back
dwmrnhh,TechniChara,They would have raised more if students could pay to either stop or restart the song.
dwms3sz,Garwood,This happened at my highschool except they played MMBop by Hanson. They played it at lunch too. Almost no one donated and it went on for about a week and a half before they staff at the highschool got fed up and made them stop.
dwmscv1,Kazuzi3,"We did that with Hanson's Mmmbop when I was on the 8th grade morning announcements crew. I don't remember why or how we picked that song specifically, but I have vivid memories of reading off of the teleprompter and screaming ""Stop the Bop!"" and then the sound person would turn it up super loud."
dwmsjqj,LasherDeviance,"My school did this when I was in high school, but it was 80's hits like Prince and Simple Minds."
dwmsnym,tony_anton,They did this at my school too. They used blue by eifel 65 though.
dwmuipu,EpicLevelWizard,I'm blue...
dwmt6tv,rostron92,we did a similar thing with Hanson's M'bop
dwmtr4c,neslynn,"When I was in high school ASB leadership, I helped design a fundraiser where we did this with Rebecca Black's Friday (it was when the song was pretty new but known). Pretty sure our goal was only like $250 though because we were a 60-70% below the poverty line school... A for effort?"
dwmtxtf,WhySpongebobWhy,"My best friend's high school did this with High School Musical's ""We're all in this together"". He wrote a letter explaining why it literally fit the definitions of extortion and torture. Delivered it to the principal stating that he'd send a copy of the letter to every news station in the state if they didn't stop it.The music ceased and the student council had it out for him for the next year and a half till he graduated."
dwmv30c,TechLover111,"My school decided to do this 2 years ago with 'What does the Fox say?'. It went on for about a day and a half, playing after every 2 periods of 8. I don't know if they stopped because they actually got paid, or if something much more exciting happened like in some of the other stories here. But either way, I was quite thankful that was over."

They kept upping the amount, so the entire 9-12 grade students signed a petition to make them stop. They raised about 500 (wanted 2000) before the student body spoke. No one tried that again. I still can't stand that song."
dwmxer3,HeyHoLetsGo615,"My school had an issue with people being late to classes so between each class they would play Hanson - Mmmbop until the hallways we're cleared.Jokes on them, that's my jam."

dwmygwc,foodtravelsleep,Our school did this although it may have been a different jb song

Everyone liked having music on during the breaks after it stopped though, so they did fundraisers for different clubs at the school after that where kids payed a dollar to play a certain song on the break. It was fun, and we didn't have cell phones then and we weren't allowed to bring electronics on campus so it was the only way we heard music during the day. I loved it lol."

So once it started up one day and without thought, I lumped up and punched the intercom.... Realised what I did, shrugged, walked into bio, rinsed sine blood from my hand, and took my seat.The teacher looked at me, looked in the hall (dangling a dented intercom), called it in.

Which, if you have a little bit of a naughty inclination, might sound dirty. With your log. In the hall. And so I was making a joke about that. But now, you have apparently corrected all of your ""log"" mistakes and so I take leave of this conversation happy with the fact that you have edited your previous posts to say that they no longer suggest that a teacher had his dick out in the middle of the hallway and was just...

dwm323u,gamer_guru,"I guess the big question is, how much would you have donated lol?"
dwm33jx,Kangaroosters,Depends how much it cost to get it to stop. No more than a dollar.
dwm34hf,gamer_guru,Tree fiddy?
dwm360u,Kangaroosters,"God dammit, loch ness monsta! I told you I ain't gonna give you no tree fiddy!"
dwmuol1,evlgns,I gave him a dollar.
dwm3wec,Ajreil,"I'd rather invest my money in a portable subwoofer. Then I can play something less annoying, like Christmas music. Or sirens."
dwm59mi,RonaldDumbsfield,I'll pay anyone that can get it out of my head right now.. baby baby awww
dwmbblt,Choco316,Honestly there are worse songs to pick. I Can't Drive 55 would have me cutting a check by noon
dwmdof9,FearnaHandfulofDucks,"I'm pretty sure that “Baby” will be the song playing over the loudspeaker when I die and go to Hell. My 3 year old daughter brought home a toy microphone that played 1 verse and 1 chorus of that song every time she pressed the button, which was probably 10,000 times. One night, it was accidentally destroyed. Maliciously."

dwmg205,nemocody,"""i guess they wanted to hear some of that ghetto ass rap music instead"" every lyric dropping the n word and calling women thots and bitches"
dwmhhil,CreatrixAnima,Which is not the same damn song over and over and over again.
dwm9fyv,Colley619,Lmao guy you guys are overreacting. They did this at my school too once. Playing music over the intercom was definitely not torturing anybody. It was for a charitable cause and people that donated did so because they wanted to and definitely didn't do it out of torture.
dwmcw9s,Trvspkt,WTF! I love Chicago now!
dwmi38y,HappyMeatbag,"Ethically questionable, but the fact that it was two seniors who suggested it makes it seem more like a prank for a good cause than the administration being greedy and mean. After all, as students, the seniors were volunteering to be tortured along with their classmates. I'm also relieved to see that the article specifies it was Evanston Township High School. For those of you who don't know, Evanston Township IL is a pretty affluent area. Trivia: John Cusack is a graduate of Evanston Township High School"
dwm6h9j,imlyingdontbelieveme,I think the school did this for a good reason and didn't extort these students at all.
dwma8ng,hemant-masarangi,Oh come on they raised that money because people wanted to donate.
dwmc3cd,SixSamuraiStorm,"Spicy opinion, commenting now to see the shitstorm"
