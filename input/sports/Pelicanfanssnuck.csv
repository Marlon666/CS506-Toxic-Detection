dtf94k3,Chinchizard,That must have been a pretty bad shot to make the guy under the basket turn around like “Who the fuck just shot that shit”
dtfa8nh,rjcarr,If you ever watch nba warm-ups they make like 90% of the shots. Even the (relative) big guys almost never miss (albeit they usually only shoot 10-12 footers).
dtff2b3,AnonymousGuy767,Shittiest NBA players >>>> most awesome amateurs. Of course they're going to make most of their shots if they're not being pressured at all.

dtfotxf,STCastleberry,"I was the worst guy in the NBA for a hot minute 12 years ago. For most guys, the pre-game warmup is their 2nd warmup of the day. We used to have a hard 1 hour practice that would end about an hour before tip-off."
dtfwlxk,BananaDick_CuntGrass,"0 points in your career. You did scored 4 points in preseason games.Confirmed worst player. Seriously though, at least you can say you made it to the big show. That means you were better than over 99% of the population."
dthbddh,STCastleberry,I never made it to the regular season.But I'm 2 for 2 from the free throw line. Better % than Steve Nash!

dtg123s,username--_--,"IIRC since it's inception, the NBA has had <5000 players. That puts him better than 99.999928571% of everyone that lived during the time the NBA has existed (that is a conservative estimate assuming the earth has had 7B NBA aged people since the 1960s)"
dtg528i,BananaDick_CuntGrass,That's why I said over 99%. Just way too lazy to do the math. Haha
dtgaepp,mr_ji,"You could probably whittle that down quite a bit to exclude women or anyone who didn't complete at least a bachelor's degree equivalent and speaks at least basic English (I know there are outliers, but since we're rounding and all)."
du7liyg,Hotel-Zulu,What? Most NBA players don't have a college degree. Not sure what you mean by that. Also it's 100% possible to enter the league speaking no English. You'd obviously learn some once you're in but it's not a requirement.

The level of skill, the amount of work, and the raw talent required to do this is insane.

dtfv7f4,rjcarr,"I think I watched 80% of the shots and I don't recall seeing a single travel (at least by Brian). Show me a play where you think he traveled. Traveling is one of the most misunderstood rules in basketball.That said, they do let a lot of actual traveling slide in the NBA."
dtg3d56,ApishGrapist,"His first possession, when he does that spin seemed like a walk to me."
dtgab15,rjcarr,"Yeah, he was sort of pushed and did that little bunny hop which is probably technically a travel, but since he was pushed out of position I doubt it would be called. A good catch, though, thanks for sharing."
dtgcf7b,pistilpete,He travels everytime he gets the ball. This dude kind of sucks. Plus his game is kind of stiff. Typical whiteboy shit
dtfkxp6,heezle,I didn't see much 'ownage' in the first 6 minutes of that video.
dtfv9ii,rjcarr,"He did miss a bunch of shots he should have made, but he shut down every player he was matched up against. I think the scores were 11-3, 11-0, 11-0, and 11-3. That said, he was probably 3-4 inches taller than the tallest guy."
dtfmuie,Faladorable,nobody even came close to him lol
dtg6fec,,"I used to play pickup with a dude who had a few preseason 10 days or whatever, not sure the details of his contracts, but he never played a real game, but made a little bit of money to start a business while he practiced with a few teams before getting cut before the season.He would absolutely murder in pickup, and most games had several college / decent level high school recruits / over seas players in them, not exactly garbage time at the Y or whatever. He was by NBA standards an undersized 4 who would rebound and D, but in pickup he would run the point and pull all 3's and was about 6'7'' and jacked. You could tell half the time he would just let other people do their thing for the sake of their own entertainment, but if his team went down he'd just go snatch a board then get a bucket to ensure they stayed on the court. The only people fast enough to guard him he'd just post them up and kill."

dtg3c4v,ravih,"It's funny, the NBA players are not pressured at all whereas the fan is probably experiencing the most pressure to make a shot he's ever had."
dtgslpp,lava9611,Kind of like gametime in the NBA...
dtftkni,vpae5b,"Not true. There are many things that can prevent somebody making the Pro's, regardless of talent. I've played in many summer league tournaments with pro's, and there are dudes who never got the chance that can ball."
dtfmgxl,,I'm still confused how some centers can't hit free throws. It's a question that eternity follows.
dtg6b7y,bigkinggorilla,"My personal theory is that centers are typically forced to practice a high release for all their shots (to avoid getting blocked in the paint) and that form interferes with how they want to shoot free throws. Might not have much validity to it, but also those guys usually were told to go down low since they were old enough to play basketball and not take shots."
dtfrtt8,therickymarquez,"Well, the ball his way to small for most of them to have full control. Check Shaq's hand in comparison with a ball and will see why its so hard for them"
dtftk1u,rjcarr,That's an excuse. You learn to adapt. There are plenty of huge dudes that shoot free throws just fine. If you gave me a mini-ball I'd learn to shoot free throws with it. The problem with Shaq is he never needed to shoot from farther than 3 feet because he was so huge and unstoppable.
dtfw4ma,nxcrosis,"IIRC, Shaq's teammates said it was more of a psychological thing since he made 99% of his free throws during practice."
dtg6ota,,"There used to be a pic floating around of a whiteboard from the Lakers practice facility showing the players FT%'s, and Dwight was over 80% IIRC. I think it may be a little in the mental as well."
dtgm6cz,shoefly72,"517/600 if memory serves me correctly. I doubt Shaq shot 99% in practice, but he definitely shot a lot better than he did in games. I do think there are some disadvantages once your hands start eclipsing a certain size, but look at Embiid and how soft of a shooting stroke he has. (I will say that Embiid seems to be such a naturally skilled player that it takes him very little time to perfect parts of his game). For younger fans/those who haven't watched Shaq highlights from his early days, his poor FT shooting probably isn't much of a surprise. But Shaq was actually an insanely skilled and coordinated player who could run the fast break and handle the ball well. He wasn't just some stiff 350 pounder with no touch who bullied his way down low."
dtfu8wm,therickymarquez,"That's science not an excuse, if your hand is bigger you'll have less control of the ball.You can adapt all you want, still gonna have worst percentages than people with ""normal"" sized hands for the same training..."
dtfugbe,JustMetod,"Not really. There are players with huge hands that can hit free throws, like Giannis. And after someone like Drummond can learn to shoot them like 5 years into his career after beimg the worst, I am m convinced any bigman can get to at least 60-70% if he puts in the effort."
dtg4dfg,Freds_Jalopy,Just because it's possible to reach the same level as someone with smaller hands (if it is at all) doesn't mean it isn't harder. Damn there were a lot of negatives in that sentence.
dtgm79p,shoefly72,I found Dan Dierdorf
dtfuuzw,therickymarquez,"And I said he couldn't?!Man, forget it... From the moment you say he can get to 60-70% if he puts the effort and still go against my opinion I have nothing more to discuss. Do you really think that 60-70% is good for an NBA player?"
dtg7l7r,DiggerW,"The overall league average is 75%, so for a big man... yes"
dtgl40d,therickymarquez,And why do you think that is good for a big man and it still is less than average for the league?Because big man have trouble shooting the ball due to their bigger hands...
dtgthup,DiggerW,You don't need to convince me.
dtfz7ah,chip-butty,"Michael Jordan had huge hands even for his size (roughly same size as Shaq's I believe) and he was 80% FT shooter, it's absolutely an excuse"
dtfzwuq,therickymarquez,"They werent the same size as Shaq's, not even close of the same length and even if they were, Shaq's (and other big players) area of contact is way bigger. Guys like Durant or Leonard have big hands (still smaller than Shaqs and other centers) but the hand tens to have a much smaller area of contact.This is simple physics I dont understand why people are disputing this"
dtg129u,chip-butty,"Look it up my dude, maybe not 100% accurate stats but quite a few places have Shaq and Jordan's hands around 28cm. There's a video of Shaq and Leonard comparing hands, Leonard is maybe 1 or 2cm smaller. You telling me the 'area of contact' is so much different it causes a near 20-30% difference in makes? It's all technique and 'hand size' is just an excuse for poor shooting"
dtg1aca,therickymarquez,"In that video shaq isnt even opening the hand at max range and it still is bigger. Plus you can see how much larger Shaq's hand is wich increases area of contact exponentially. I dont need to look it up, I ve seen Jordan holding a ball vs shaq holding it and the differences are more than obvious."
dtg2661,chip-butty,"So explain someone like David Robinson or Patrick Ewing? Those guys managed to shoot around 74% for their career, surely there hands didnt have that much less surface contact?Shaq is bad at free throws because he never needed to be good at them at any point to be a monster player. He has even said himself he wishes he practiced them more so he would be in top 3 all time scoring. Again it doesn't matter how big or small your hands are, it's literally down to practice."
dtg30yd,therickymarquez,"No it aint. I picked Shaq as an example and I'm not saying he couldnt be better. 74% is still low for an NBA player and those are the best examples you can get, meanwhile you pick guys with average hand sizes like Curry or Nash and you get 90%. Practice aint everything, your anatomy has a big influence on a difficulty of a task."
dtg4yiv,chip-butty,"Dirk Nowitzki and Yao Ming 88 and 84% FT shooters, around Shaq's size more or less. Better example? 74% is actually right around NBA average so its not bad, and still a lot better than Shaq's 55%. Curry and Nash are good at free throws because they practice them.Shaq never needed to practice. No coach in the world is going to bench a 7 foot monster just because he cant hit free throws. Curry and Nash needed to practice shooting and free throws to compensate for their lack.of height and physicality in comparison to bigger guys. Going back to Dirk he can hit free throws at a better rate with his left hand than Shaq can full stop. Why? Practice"
dtgl2og,therickymarquez,"Man, you must have a mental problem. Im done with this.I swear to god, someone could say ""the grass is green"" and there would be a reddit saying it aint because he once saw some yellow grass"
dtgmjru,chip-butty,"Im the one backing up my arguments with stats my man, you are merely rebutting with 'muh hand size'. Additionally check out Shaq's awkward janky shot form compared to the nice, smooth releases of Curry or Nash. How do they have those nice forms you ask? You know the answer my friend."
dtgnmix,therickymarquez,"Stop talking about shaq man, im talking about big handed guys in general. Lol, stats? Go and see the biggest FT percentages and see their hand sizes"
dtgqlnu,Surinical,I get your point but I always find it weird when people complain about someone that's one of the top people in the world at a task and talked about how they could do it better in some small aspect as though that is either true or means something.
dtfxcdl,Born_Ruff,"If a basketball is too small for your hands, at that point you should probably just be able to palm the ball and dunk from the free throw line."
dtgstvh,alienlanes7,needs to be a less uncool underhand freethrow style
dthg7ak,IdioticJuror,Pressure. And in practice they are able to get into a rhythm. thats what me thinks.
dtfsv0o,Damon_Bolden,"That's why I think there's no good excuse for like 60% from the free throw line. I realize there's a ton of pressure and you're in front of a pretty big audience, but come on. It's one shot that you take uncontested and can practice a billion times at different ranges of fatigue and conditions. Missed free throws frustrate me"
dtfehc9,PureRandomness529,"Also the rebound shot back out his way, so dude was probably just watching the ball."
dtfoaqj,88isafat69,Lol I went to a spurs game a few yers back and just watched Finley literally hit like 11 3s in a row like it wasn't shit
dtg1sll,PKA_Lurker,Bull shit they make 50-60% max they're usually taking difficult shots
dtg0x2h,ta6514,Anyone other than a big is 75-85% at the Free throw line

dvmc8ko,NikonManiac,"This is one of the reasons I still stream games on Reddit even though I have the ESPN and NBA channels on DirectTV.

dtfofvo,reevejyter,"You know people say this kind of stuff all the time, but it's just not true. Unless it's a really good shooter, they'll make like 70%."

dtf9gvf,coloradocorey,I got kicked out of a Broncos game for throwing my friends beanie towards the field. Didn't even make it to the players from the 6th row. Lol. They most certainly threatened to arrest me and stated at bare minimum they'd give me a $1000 fine. They just escorted us out (my buddy got kicked out for talking crap to them for kicking me out.)
dtg4rbh,kitschyliepard,"Slip hazard, maybe. Fleece/fabric of any.sort really and laquered wood floors do not mix well with athletes running up and down the gym busy looking at a ball and not what might be on the ground in front of them.And it's generally not nice to throw things at people anyways."

You caused an issue for them, you raised a security threat, so you deserved to be punished for that. As I say, you did something silly that you didn't think about the consequences for at the time, which is something everyone does. And then you saw the consequences. From your view it was harmless but people throwing stuff isn't harmless to the guards."

dtfanmg,newmoneyblownmoney,I can't arrest you but I can tell you to get the fuck out my house for not obeying my rules and if you refuse to leave THEN you get arrested for trespassing.
dtfbu15,bullseyed723,Yeah. Thus the point of my comment being about getting arrested.
dtfcajm,newmoneyblownmoney,Yea but you alluded right to being arrested. The cop look like he gave him a warning. I would think the next step would be to escort him out. Are you a cop? I don't think any civilian with common sense would recommend arrest for something so petty. That's a gross overreaction.

dtfbtbf,IDontDownvoteAnyone,I'm pretty sure it's going to escalate from a finger pointing to a finger wagging. I don't envy that boy.
dtfei1s,reduxde,"aggressive finger pointing is the equivalent of a street fight in China, i've seen entire mobs of people aggressively pointing mere centimeters from each other's faces, whilst waggling their fingers haphazardly.However, finger-to-nose contact is strictly forbidden unless you want to fight a gang of 10 people with sticks. My brother in law had a road rage situation where both people jumped out of the car and finger pointing ensued. He accidentally poked the other guy's nose, and 10 of the guys friends jumped out of literally nowhere with sticks and beat him badly enough to cause a hairline fracture to his elbow.swear to god that's a true story. the other driver had to pay nearly $5,000 in damages, which was crippling to him and his family... to a Chinese person that's equivalent to an American being asked to pay $30,000"
dtfix3j,Jazsta123,"I want to believe this, I really do"
dtftl32,reduxde,"which part, the damages bit or the finger pointing bit?my wife's sister is a sack of shit. She'll borrow stuff from you and never return it. her husband is a low IQ brawler, but if you know china well enough you'll know that even if you start a fight, if you lose the fight, you can get paid.Mild exception: recently a young guy told an old guy to quit smoking in an elevator. Shortly after, the old guy had a heart attack and the family blames the young guy for provoking him. Local court ordered him to pay, but the family of the fucktard with the cigarette escalated it to superior court and the superior court said ""fuck your grandpa he shouldn't have been smoking in the elevator"".Justice served."

dtfkz04,Eternal_Reward,"Any concealed carry instructor, or gun instructor in general, will tell you when you get pulled over to tell the cop you have a gun, and then wait for instructions. He didn't, he said he had a gun which put the cop on edge immediately, and then reached for his wallet. Its textbook what your not suppose to do at a stop.What is the cop suppose to think? He told him to not reach for whatever he was reaching for, he didn't comply, we all know what happened.I'm not happy about what happened, but it wasn't as black and white as you're making it."
dtft0o6,Hawke666,If the cop had *thought* anything at all no one would have gotten shot. He told him to give him his license and registration and then shot him for trying to do so.
dtgbk07,Webby915,The cop shouldnt have shot him and deserves to be in jail.
dtflaza,nnalic,Your right on that. In the video though you do hear the cop say don't reach for it and Castile say that he wasn't. I just don't like how it took about 40s for a whole clip to be emptied into someone. Both sides could have done better and I wish the cop was a little better at deescalation.
dtffvzk,WorkingClassAmerican,"I don't know why because that didn't happen. If you'd like to talk about it let's use actual facts. He reached for his glovebox that contained his insurance and pistol, no?"
dtfg4i1,nnalic,My bad. Why would he TELL the police officer he had a gun before getting the gun to shoot the officer. I sayto shoot him because the only reason the officer had to use force is if he thought that's what was going to happen.
dtfg8dj,t920698,Yeah I thought the guy had nice shooting form too
dtfgbjn,nnalic,Yeah his form was pretty nice. His releas was a little low but a shooting coach could fix that right up.
dtfg9px,WorkingClassAmerican,"You're inserting your own version of reality here. I don't remember anyone saying he was going to shoot the cop, I remember them saying he reached for a gun. How do you react in stressful situations? Cool as a cucumber I'm sure, nothing you've ever done contradicts anything else."
dtfgith,nnalic,"Idk how I would react in that situation, but it's not my job to be cool in “stressful” situations (stressful is in quotations because the cop was TOLD he had a gun. And the man had a woman and child in the car...) but that's not my job. It's his. If you don't believe your in danger don't fire your weapon...."
dtfh06u,WorkingClassAmerican,"Right, if you're afraid don't reach for the gun in your car with the kid and chick in it. If you decide that being black is what will get you killed then ask the cop to disarm you before proceeding."
dtfhkpg,nnalic,"Right, and if you can't handle “stressful” situations maybe don't be a cop or handle a firearm. Lol it's not even a black/white thing. It's a “hey let's not fire 7 shots, 40 seconds into a routine traffic stop”"
dtfhvg7,WorkingClassAmerican,"Cop did great. Cleared of wrongdoing. He killed a criminal that couldn't follow directions if his life depended on it. Oh wait, it did. Good on that officer for doing his job."

dtfl4vs,nnalic,Idk if you can say it's “typical” for democrat strongholds to fail. Houston is blue and it's the fastest growing city in America. If you elect bad representatives you get a bad product regardless of red or blue
dtflcn5,WorkingClassAmerican,Wrong
dtfmpm2,nnalic,What part?
dtfmtfw,WorkingClassAmerican,All of it.
dtfmwrw,nnalic,Houston is blue. It's the fastest growing city. So maybe the last part? But that's not really debatable. George Bush wouldn't be a good president if he was blue so
dtfn4um,WorkingClassAmerican,Wrong
dtfrdrn,nnalic,Just lmk what specifically you think is wrong
dtfrhbw,WorkingClassAmerican,You.
dtfrmxl,nnalic,Right but what did I say specifically
dtfswlw,WorkingClassAmerican,Wrongness.
dtftbg9,nnalic,See you say workingclass. But based on the responses and speediness of the responses I wanna say freshman in high school. But I digress. I'm bored now.
dtftnii,WorkingClassAmerican,Cool story. Tell me about this glorious homeland of yours that you ran away from
dtfu74e,nnalic,“Cool story”. My G even I don't say that anymore. Definitely high school. And I already did. It's beautiful. I wish they would elect people that weren't corrupt but I think they'll figure it out eventually.
dtfudlq,WorkingClassAmerican,What race so you think is best?
dtfuf4n,nnalic,I don't watch nascar but the Indy 500 Ig? That was random
dtfuu89,WorkingClassAmerican,NASCAR? Sad
dtfv5dc,nnalic,IKR. That's why I'm confused
dtfzk9b,mylivingeulogy,Jesus... Why did I read this entire thread. I would have given up on that troll a long time ago.
dtfh8um,hangoverDOTTED,"He didn't reach for the gun. In fact, you can very clearly hear the cop saying, ""Don't reach for the gun"" and Philando calmly say ""Ok. I'm not reaching for the gun."" ""Don't reach for the gun."" ""I'm not reaching for the gun."""
dtfhcn6,WorkingClassAmerican,Except the part where he did and got killed for it. Yeah minus that part he did not reach for or around the gun
dtfhhmg,hangoverDOTTED,"He didn't reach for the gun, though. The cop requested he not reach for it and he very clearly agreed not to reach for it. Then he did not reach for the gun.Stop trying to make up what happened."
dtfhqyg,WorkingClassAmerican,"In very jealous of how you think. It must be nice. This all started as a shitting on cops conversation and as usual the worst example was picked because you people have an agenda. Want to talk about a real case where a guy was obviously murdered by the police? Great, there's many out there. This is not one of those."
dtfhvkg,hangoverDOTTED,Except this is a case of a cop murdering someone for doing exactly what that person was supposed to do.
dtfhy0f,WorkingClassAmerican,Reaching for a gun isn't what you should do when you get pulled over. Just thought I'd let you know
dtfi319,hangoverDOTTED,"And there you go again, making things up.He didn't reach for the gun."
dtficoh,WorkingClassAmerican,Go reenact this in your car and tell yourself how obvious it was that nothing happened some more.
dtficwy,WorkingClassAmerican,Go reenact this in your car and tell yourself how obvious it was that nothing happened some more. It seems to be working so far.
dtfih29,hangoverDOTTED,There is no need for re-enactments. We have video.I'm done though. You obviously are just trying to gaslight everyone.
dtfijri,WorkingClassAmerican,Bye sweetheart inshallah
dtfjini,My_Ex_Got_Fat,"Lol yeah lets talk facts, like how the police aren't trained in de-escalation, are militarized, most worship the vigilante justice style of Marvel's The Punisher, think it's US vs THEM, will defend their coworkers regardless if said coworkers did anything wrong, have been caught multiple times on tape that they then tried to destroy planting/manipulating evidence, and find no wrongdoing when they investigate themselves.If cops actually cared, their unions wouldn't spend millions of dollars trying to keep marijuana from being legalized, or lobbying to keep civil asset forfeiture from being changed so THEY'RE the ones that actually have to prove the money was from illicit sources.You're probably right though, this pig was probably way different than all the rest."
dtftv1m,AfterReview,I haven't seen someone take their seat that fast since 5th grade.Something oddly wholesome about this entire situation.
dtfk8hk,ImSoBasic,I think it had more to do with the fact he had the money to afford court-side seats.
dtg85mg,Ass4ssinX,Username checks out.
dtfich3,sarcasm24,Victim blaming bullshit
dtfj7gz,incharge21,"What? I don't think it's blaming the victim, you just have a better shot of getting away from the cops without consequence if you completely cooperate. That doesn't mean it's always justified what happens if you don't cooperate, just that cooperation lowers harsh consequence. Of course there are times that doesn't happen, it's a generality, there are going to be exceptions."
dtfsqsh,Im-A-W1zard,Sometimes its the victims fault.
dtftqn7,sarcasm24,That's not what the word victim means
dtftw5a,Im-A-W1zard,"If I ask someone to stab me and I get stabbed, am I not both the victim of a stabbing, and at fault?Ever hear of The Darwin Awards? Those people are they not both victims, and to blame?"
dtfu0zr,Im-A-W1zard,"Also here is the definition of a victim ""a person harmed, injured, or killed as a result of a crime, accident, or other event or action.""It says nowhere that it can't be their fault."
dtfgvps,Bubonic_Butters,A few bad examples you see on the bias driven hate machine (media) isn't indicative of the rest of the millions of police officers.
dtfvkxq,niuguy,"Dude, I know what you're saying, and I'd agree with you if it wasn't so fucking hard to punish cops who make terrible choices. Yes, in any group of people you're going to have some assholes that ruin it for everyone. The blue shield is just too strong and a significant number of people will defend the officer no matter what just as you have those who will blame the cop no matter what. In the army we didn't have a union to save us. We fuck up we get punished. It wouldn't necessarily kill our career but it would hurt and it kept you in check. We didn't have this blue shield to save us when we ruined people's lives. A staff sergeant in my unit accidentally shot his rifle on base. Dude was canned from his job that night and reassigned."
dtgycqq,ChrisGaylor,"Except for the fact cops generally get found not guilty by civilians when they go to trial and people still get angry and blame the ""Blue shield."""
dtgyjhe,niuguy,"True, it's a bit both imo."
dtfh88l,4_5_6,"That's a fair point, edited."
dtforzz,thenhe,"Yikes! That old narrative again? Take a few minutes and go research the citizen complaint statistics against cops before and after body-cam testing. It was (is) far, far more than a ""few bad apples."" We can put apologists like you out to pasture as your opinion has been proven wrong EVERY time a new body-cam study results is released."

dtfsc1o,ruok4a69,I reject your surveillance state and choose to rely on the humanity of my fellow people instead.
dtfsn5g,myeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeers,yikes...
dtftf8l,ruok4a69,"You realize that just because you think something is a good idea, doesn't necessarily mean everyone agrees? I'm all for “watching the watchers”, but you don't get to watch me. What I do is none of your business, and your statement re: surveillance of citizens is chilling."
dtfw3bb,Mocha_Bean,"If a cop is watching you with their eyes, *you're literally already being surveilled by the state.* The camera just keeps it objective. I trust the digital camera more than I trust the cop's meat cameras."
dtfxn0c,ruok4a69,"- We explicitly trust those people to watch us to some extent, with many, many restrictions, which restrictions I'm quite in favor of. - I wasn't arguing against police body cams; I was arguing against general surveillance of the citizenry (a la London). - The cop's “meat eyes” can only pick up so much. I don't need cameras watching my every move and streaming it to the world. It's not the world's business what I do."
dtfzeh2,Mocha_Bean,"""Streaming it to the world?"" What? You think they've got it up on facebook live or something?"
dtg0sau,ruok4a69,Many surveillance cameras are streamed live. The city nearest me streams dozens of traffic cameras and at least ten street level cameras.
dtfs7kj,speed3_freak,You got more conformation bias than a 90 year old Fox News watching granny in rural Alabama.

dtfcffj,91seejay,I feel like he handled it well gave him a stern finger point. I don't think the guy will do it again.
dtfcut7,Painting_Agency,Finger + old guy mustache = authority.

dtfrinf,vVvMaze,"Honestly that guard was real cool about it. Could have potentially kicked the person out but just escorted him back to the chair and said dont do that again. I think if you are the person doing this, this was the best possible reaction you could have gotten from security."
dtfpaps,MrSnoutfair,At least he didn't get kicked out of the arena
dtfbce4,tinglingearballs,This motherfucker has every last drop of my respect. If only I had his balls... That smile at the end ... that says all I need to hear!
dtfe6dq,Electric_Tiger01,Turns out all you have to do to get his balls is do some uncoordinated active stretching for a few seconds then call for the ball. Someone will then pass you his balls.

dtg1muh,lightlad,"I thought not. It's not a story the /r/sports would tell you. It's a /r/nfl legend. Darth Manning was a Dark Lord of the Colts, so powerful and so wise he could use Force to influence the football to create wins… He had such a knowledge of the offensive side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing. The meme side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing the superbowl, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his team's photographer everything he knew about playing in the cold, then his photographer took a picture of him when it was cold. Ironic.

dtfdino,pinkfloydfan4life,I find it so weird that there are people unfamiliar with this term.
dtfexkp,flabcannon,It's an American term - initially i heard it in some baseball movies and assumed it meant the seats in the foul zone because the ball is likely to hit your nose. Then I came to the US and learned what it really meant.
dtfjbwx,that1prince,"It's a sports term and it's mainly American, plus the story made it to the front page so a large number of readers may be foreign or speak English as a second language where they know all of the grammar and speak well, but don't know slang, idioms, or colloquialisms. Also people on the internet are often younger than you think. There are probably quite a few kids in this thread.When you come across someone who doesn't know some piece of information that you feel is common knowledge to know by say, age 30, look at it this way... The day you are born you know nothing, and the day you turn 30 you know all the ""common phrases"" of your language. That means there was a day in the lives of all of those 100s of millions of people above that age range who learned that piece of information. There's probably a few thousand per day, each day, that are learning something that ""everybody knows"" for the first time."
dtfdu0v,drkalmenius,"I had no idea. Don't think the term is used in football so not popular here. Though I'm not sure, I'm more of a Rugby fan."
dtfdu8l,Flan_,Same. My girlfriend was super confused when I said my Eagles seats are in the nosebleeds and I told her she is the only person I have met that's never heard of that saying. Now it's just her and RockCroc2000.
dtfpl22,vbullinger,You've never met that dude though...
dtfqayw,PhilxBefore,How would you know?
dtfplmj,vbullinger,Cake eaters
dtfgr7u,clown_shoes69,"Especially in a sports sub, which is the only context I've ever heard the term used. It would make a little more sense if we were in, like, /r/ihatesports or something."
dtfk5zi,dogggi,It's on the front page.
dtfl32e,clown_shoes69,What?
dtk8u1t,dogggi,IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE.
dtfentf,MisterCrist,"Also if you ever watch anime and wonder why males get nosebleeds in it, it is because in at higher elevations, getting an erection can cause nosebleeds due to the increase of blood pressure."
dtfh00f,Rockcroc2000,Good thing I don't watch anime
dtfjbxx,MisterCrist,"Eh your missing out some of the best movies/TV shows I have ever watched have been anime. The whole nosebleed thing is just a pg way to show that the character is aroused or a pervert and it mostly used as a gag, with some of the more silly anime having the character being propelled into the air by the force of the nosebleed or other characters worried about that character because they have lost so much blood."
dtfjp5i,Rockcroc2000,Nah man anime just isn't my thing
dtfl2gk,MisterCrist,"Yeah and thats fine, just explaining how they use nosebleeds more as my explanation might of made it sound worse then how it is actually used. But yeah your completely fine not watching anime as your the one missing out on some great stories but that's your choice, I don't lose anything out of you not watching it :p"
dtflga3,Rockcroc2000,"I'd waste time watching anime tho, I hate anime with a passion man."
dtfmmmv,MisterCrist,"Again I'm not trying to convince you to watch it haha, just saying your missing out on some great stories but that's completely fine if it's not for you. Although I will say if your saying that based of dragonball z, Naruto and all those types of anime, most anime is alot more varied and better then that but I don't know you at all and I don't know your experiences or why you dislike it so much and it's honestly completely fine if you dislike anime, it's your opinion, I can't stand the marvel movies (except minus a few) and avoid them like the plague, but that my choice even if I am missing out."
dtfnq0q,Rockcroc2000,I guess you're right.
dtfglat,pm_me_tits_and_tats,You know. I've known the meaning of nosebleed seats my whole life and never once questioned *why* they're called nosebleeds.
dtfma7t,chasethatdragon,When I was a kid I always wanted to get those seats to get a nose bleed lol
dtfj7vz,shibibbly,"I got that way wrong, I thought nosebleed were really close cause you get hit by a ball or a player and get a nosebleed, am I an idiot?"
dtfcx5a,Falcon4242,Nosebleeds is a common term for the cheap upper seats where you can't see anything. They're called so because of nosebleeds being more common at higher elevations.
dtfer6n,pump_the_brakes_son,"They're seats next to all the coke heads. Hence, nose bleed."
dtfgizz,Only_Movie_Titles,I like this answer best
dtfklz9,CommunistCappie,"Finally, the correct explanation. Thank you"
dtfcvk9,dpx,It's what they call the seats way up in the rafters/highest section up. 300s or 500s usually
dtfcwar,robbsc,Seats so high up you get a nosebleed from the altitude
dtfcy1d,GFKnowsFirstAcctName,Nosebleeds refer to how some people get nosebleeds with altitude sickness. So the nosebleeds would refer to the seats really high up and far away from the game.
dtfdnqy,youdubdub,Not to mention one of the most fervent and furious mustached finger wag barks ever witnessed.
dtfkv78,yffulmuggum,What do you think of this never ending rain today?
dtfc6uz,Grahamshabam,"""I'm sorry, I didn't know I couldn't do that"""
dtfh46a,treepoop,"""Dave...DAVE! It's the god damned cops."""
dtfggtv,Mikeychims85,"Funny I was thinking about that special today. I love right before this line the way Chapelle says chip turns the radio up ""We're not gonna take it!"". Lol"
dtfgtwy,clown_shoes69,Dave's white guy voice is one of the true gifts to comedy. Still makes me laugh every time.
dtfm1u4,thegermancow,It was good wasn't it.Because I did know I couldn't do that!
dtfmoot,Isthisaweekday,My go to phrase at work.
dtfd6w2,HealthyDoughnut,I get this reference.
dtfbj2f,borntorunathon,"He got a nice little scolding from Officer Mustache, but not a mean one, more like the kind of ""no more!"" you give a kid who's throwing broccoli at his little sister."
dtfcgd8,RooLoL,The cop was super chill
dtfevvm,Norcan987,"He really was. People were there to enjoy the game, and the guy on the court was just a little loopy. The cop wasn't going to ruin the enjoyment, and was very professional (Wish all cops were like this! You can just imagine him going home with a grin laughing about it in good spirits)."
dtff2xy,RooLoL,Agree. The cop was loose and prob had a bit of a laugh. Showed he was also human and not some uniform.
dtfgkj7,_brainfog,Did we watch the same video? The cop was pointing his finger at his face while giving him a stern look and saying something to him. How you can conclude all that from such a short video is quite impressive...
dtfgumi,RooLoL,Because 99/100 times I see someone run onto the court/field/stage that shouldn't be there at any public event gets tackled. The stern finger and face is quite light in reality to the situation and context.
dtfh6at,uncleawesome,The cop is pretty old. If that was a second year cop straight out of Afghanistan there probably would have been a different ending.
dtfoxmb,ZaphodTrippinBalls,"I feel like a cop who had been in the military first would be less likely to overreact especially if they saw combat or just some real shit. In y experience, those guys know that constitutes a real problem and are usually pretty chill.It's the guys who just went straight to being a cop that worry me more. I know more than one who just always wanted to be a cop, and they are premium, grade-a dickheads."
dtftn10,doublea08,Comparing police training to military training...
dtfpr5p,Taaargus,Military training does a much better job of teaching principles of threat escalation/de-escalation and problem solving without violence than anything a cop gets taught in 3 months at the academy.
dtfhqdp,RooLoL,I would tend to agree with that for sure. Also from what it sounds like in this thread is that he may be a season ticket holder of those seats so that cop likely knows who he is.
dtfjlh2,NardDogAndy,Good thing officer Philip Brailsford wasn't there with his 'You're Fucked' rifle.
dtg1c4k,username--_--,Was he human or was he dancer?
dtfkmc6,younggregg,"A lot of those cops are, a buddy of mine has season courtside tickets and we would bullshit with the same cop all the time. My take on it is they actually really love that job and I don't think they got stuck with it as a punishment or anything. I mean honestly you're getting paid to be courtside, not sitting outside in the cold directing traffic for drunk people."
dtfficr,iidxred,"These days, I'm pretty sure any cop that doesn't have a weapon drawn counts as super chill."
dtfg4zk,alflup,"He gave him the Grandpa ""Sit Down or I'm Pulling this Car Over"" look."
dtfntwb,PhantomStranger52,"For the most part yeah. I personally can't stand someone pointing the finger at me like that. I'd probably have done the wrong thing, popped off at the mouth, and made things worse."
dtflccg,ninerdawg,"Got the exact same ""No!"" that I give my dog when he does something silly."
dtfl5h8,rustyshackleford8,"The cop seemed like your typical grumpy depressed old person who's been given authority over something. Like that one old man in church who goes around telling the kids to quiet down, until one day he can't tell the difference and scolds an adult because he's blind, and everyone has a laugh and he's totally embarrassed so he takes a handful of pills when he gets home because he's been alone ever since Gladys passed on and he's ready to meet Jesus."
dtfxel5,joshuakang190,Jesus Christ dude that just went straight to depressing
dtg7x2u,rustyshackleford8,"Is it more or less depressing when I tell you it's a true story? Dude's name was JD.Odd... It's always old men who are named JD. So do they become JD when they get old, or are they JD all their lives? Because I can't imagine a kid named that."
dtfnn5q,,He was making sure that he understands that he has to check his blood sugar and check it often
dtfeagg,omelettedufromage,"If the seat the officer ""sent"" him to was actually the kid's seat, he's probably there with someone connected (courtside season-ticket-holder / team management / player... Officer Friendly is probably used to having to give those folks a long leash."
dtfc3x3,WaterMnt,speaking from experience? ;)
dtfd0mj,Painting_Agency,"more like /r/borntothrowabroc, am I right? :D"
dtfdfc1,borntorunathon,ayy lmao
dtff2ee,WaterMnt,"yeah, but why'm I getting downvoted for that.. u know that dude throws broccoli at his little sister.."
dtfcvgj,TheDenseCumTwat,PleSe don't wink at me.

dtfdh4e,borntorunathon,me too thanks
dtff33u,WaterMnt,;)
dtff6a4,borntorunathon,i can't believe you've done this
dtff0vw,microtrash,That finger pointing from the officer made me chuckle
dtffgzc,why_rob_y,"It's risky, though. Because now everyone else sees that and figures, ""I could do that and not even get in trouble."" Then unfortunately the next guy or the guy after that will have to be when they crack down, and will get kicked out."
dtfhd4u,cmcewen,Yeah but now everybody gonna be doing it

dtfc7iv,theoffbeatbear,Did you not see the stern finger-pointing he received? It was VERY stern.
dtfcyw4,Saneless,"Actually, it was very stern. If looks could kill he would have ended up with at least a concussion."
dtfgdnb,alflup,Granps was about to make him go fetch a switch.
dtfmthd,eat_thecake_annamae,"I've never seen Granps spelled like that, yet it makes so much sense 🤔"

dtfwh1j,iLikeToBiteMyNails,A buddy of mine got kicked out of courtside raptors seats for calling a player a snitch. Got an official warning and everything. It's hit or miss out there.

dtfd3e7,iushciuweiush,> I expected him to get tackled and carried out.I'm guessing if he didn't have court side seats this is exactly what would've happened.
dtfdzd4,reduxde,"this was on reddit a while ago, a fan jumped the fence after a championship (football?) game, wearing a team jersey, and ran in and posed with the team and became part of their official championship photo, and nobody noticed until after the photo was developed. He'd apparently done this kind of thing dozens of times. British chap, if memory serves. Also I mean international football, not American.Anyway, he's got courtside seats and the officer did look to be scolding him a bit at the end, so he probably has some money and probably they know who he is.Anyone have a name/photo? It hasn't been that long but I drink heavily so it's a struggle even to remember what I had for dinner last night."

dtfbj4a,Martin_Samuelson,> I expected him to get tackled and carried out.That says something about our society.
dtfde8k,nckrsslr,What? What should they do to people who run onto the field of play and won't leave?
dtfoz26,BeenWildin,Ask them to go back to their seat.. Did you not see the gif
dtfgux5,WereWolf_Jones,"You dont respond against non-violence with violence. I mean *I* do, but generally its frowned upon by society."
dtfcf8o,headhouse,Also says something about media portrayals vs reality.
dtfcmfh,NothingsShocking,"actually, going onto the field or court is a huge no no. there are always those goof offs running on the field and the security chases them and tackles them and it's funny but, nobody knows if there's a Monica Seles stalker running out there, so I'm pretty sure security doesn't think it's funny at all."
dtfctj3,,"Agreed, it's a question of liability. If they allow fans to do that then the 1/100 time a fan does something to injure a player the team and stadium have a massive lawsuit on their hands"
dtfe0fk,drkalmenius,"Yep. And with terrorist attacks too, running onto the pitch and opening fire or setting off a bomb is ludicrously easy"
dtfcvq9,treditor13,?
dtfd0nv,IDontDownvoteAnyone,??? How so. There's more evidence of people being forced off fields in a harsh way than videos like this. I can just cite youtube for that.
dtfdf2b,,"The instances where they aren't thrown off the field aren't filmed, are they?"
dtffpqi,headhouse,I can't really cite all the instances that end with a stern finger-wagging (like this one does) because they don't make it onto youtube.
dtfjfx6,bitJericho,So basically abuses of power shouldn't be news worthy.
dtfkxdg,headhouse,Lol. Clearly not the point I was making. But have fun with that strawman.
dtfmncg,CommentingsForLosers,lol no it doesn't
dtfh8ir,Crede777,I'm ok with living in a society where those people are tackled and thrown out of the stadium / arena.
dtfdryy,Snappatures,I'm really glad they didn't kick him out. Definitely a harmless prank and very well executed.
dtferwv,Julieandrewsdildo,Yeah he's lucky. Some places will revoke season tickets to ticket holders for this type of behavior. Even if the ticket holder sold them to a friend or whatever. Court side season tickets are almost always pretty expensive too.
dtfgrpx,Testymcthrowaway,“Don't make me shoot you!”-That cop probably
dtfere1,Gialandon,After all the police videos I was expecting a shooting.
dtflyqx,BatchThompson,"""And don't do it again!"""
dtfq160,mellofello808,Dude had front row seats. He probably has juice in the town.

dtfetnq,Ralphusthegreatus,He got a quick scolding too.

dtffqjc,ajd341,Those are pretty expensive seats!
dtffqsg,jahmezz,"Probably cause this was during warmups, huh? Note to self: get on court when the game hasn't started yet."

dtfgo95,reggie4gtrblz2bryant,Its mardi gras down here. There are so many more things to worry about than this.
dtfh7mr,Sirtopofhat,He's probably a season ticket holder. Can't say much to those people
dtfhv8e,Saneless,"Eh, for those seats I'm sure there's someone ready to take 'em instead."
dtfjbjc,Sirtopofhat,Idk man it is the Pelicans and Boogie is done for the year.
dtfhfjw,Mlawless,I love how he sat back down in a FRONT ROW seat. Anyone sitting courtside is a millionaire or celebrity or family of the team.
dtfi4b8,simjanes2k,"that cop talked him down like an angry dad""SON I WARNED YOU ABOUT THIS, DON'T YOU LISTEN??"""

dtfnpvv,win95ismyjam,He's in the court side seat. That might have influenced their decision.
dtfo32p,musclecard54,Well he clearly got a very firm warning
dtfoftt,Plu94011,Santa just puts you on the naughty list.
dtfpiy5,TriggeredScape,wHitE pRiViLeGe
dtfplcb,giveitago,I don't know. I think he was resisting just a tiny bit. A little stick time would have driven the lesson home.
dtfpoa4,kfmush,That cop's finger wag was classic.
dtftfx8,here2amaze,How do we know that's his seat? His real seat is probably in the nose bleed section and he probably just got a free upgrade.
dtftsqa,Harriet_12_3,"Granted it's a bit different since the pitch is more separate from the crowd than a basketball court is but a UK comedian got as far as pitch warm ups during a football match and we arrested, fined and I think banned from attending matches also."

But all we got was a finger point. Jesus cops in America suck"
dtg1v3x,HighPriestofShiloh,Dude's got front row seats. One percenters get a warning for EVERYTHING.
dtg8e96,ThisIsntGoldWorthy,He probably told him to wait there while he called in more people to escort him out.
dtgb21j,Touchit88,"Absolutely. Now the guy has an awesome story to tell without any of the consequences of being arrested, detained, etc."
dtgm5wf,readmymind5,I'm glad they didn't shoot to kill
dtgugcn,Airsh,"Do we have to stereotypical all cops just because there's some rotten ones in the world? Everyone has no tolerance for stereotyping races, but no one mines when it's about law enforcement..."
dtguv09,Saneless,"I wasn't even stereotyping cops. More how people who run sports are zero fun, and what they demand of their security/cops. Overall I think cops are great, but I'm very polite and obeying to them (even while I was being arrested), white, dressed like a normal guy, normal car, so my experiences may vary."
dtgvouz,Airsh,"Sorry. I've just seen many Reddit users bring up cops in a negative light in general and how surprised they are when one acts chill. Yeah, experiences may vary. I've had my encounters with police and were reasonable people."
dtgwoy6,Saneless,"I figure most of them see shitty people all day, so they're probably a bit on the ""oh another shitty person I have to deal with"" kind of attitude by default, regardless of how nice of a person they are (it's probably an easy mode to fall into). I try to change that perception for them as much as I can as fast as I can."
dtgy51u,Airsh,"Something like working for customer service probably doesn't help. It sucks how one shitty person can potentially ruin everyone's day.On another note: My only ""No fun allowed"" moment with an officer was because some neighbor complained about me and my friends doing fireworks within the city limits. (Even though many do fireworks within the city limits anyways...) It sucked, but we cooperated and lit them elsewhere. It's funny because they really don't enforce this city law until a complaint happens. They turn a blind eye and let people have their fun on New Year's and July 4th."
dtfbw1n,whatdoy0uknow,For having some harmless fun you think it's appropriate if he got kicked out?
dtfc73a,FiREorKNiFE-,"He just said he expected it, not that he thought it was appropriate."
dtfd2y5,Saneless,"I just assumed most places have a zero-bs policy about people being anywhere near players or the court. They usually don't have human sides to them. Hell, at one nhl game some dick in a suit tried to get me arrested for selling tickets within x-yards of the entrance (I was a season-ticket holder and just couldn't make the game that night)."
dtfc3iu,OneNDPAlbertan,no. but it's what i;ve come to expect from any form of security in the US

dtfgync,cunninglinguist96,Probably after the game
dtfjvkm,TheOtherCoenBrother,"I think it hit the rim and bounced back, that's why he gave it away instead of trying again. If someone else had caught the ball and thrown it to him I feel like he would have gone for another shot"
dtfdxu9,sleepslate,Is it really sneaking onto the court when he just got out of his chair and walked 3 steps to the right?
dtfgwhw,Jeffk01,"I love the scolding finger in the face. “You, sir, are no longer welcome at Bushwood Country Club!”"

Basically, the idea is that his boss is obviously pissed, but instead of yelling at him and telling him to get his shit together, he's giving out compliments. Things like, ""I've been keeping an eye on you all morning and need to tell you... what an *awesome* guy you are! I'm taking these to practice!"" – (while walking away) ""You're promoted!"" – (while pointing at his eyes) ""You have beautiful eyes!"" and the catch phrase is ""Hear what you want to hear – Deezer""."

Luckily the grounds keeper was just around the corner out of her sight and asked what the hell she thought she was doing. She let me go, but didn't look happy that I was there all the same.

For that price I'd expect to be invited onto the court to take a practice shot with the team.(EDIT - Did find a few floor seats for $900 too but they were not in the same floor location where he could casually get up and pull this off. You could also get good seats for $200-$500 for a Pelicans game, like behind the hoops or behind the bench, but not 1st row on the floor where this guy is clearly sitting. Game prices change based on a number of factors.)"

dtff0s6,Dman9494,"Just looked up some prices, courtside seats at the Staples Center run over $4000. Thats about what I was expecting, of course tickets for smaller market teams will run quite a bit less."
dtfphb5,,LA is a whole different animal. Everyone out there makes 6 figure salaries due to cost of living so their tickets are exponentially more expensive. Same thing with the Knicks. Pretty much every other market is 1/2 the price or less
dtfhyue,_Slip_n_Slide_,I've seen courtside tickets go for like $450/$550 in Pheonix
dtfjkta,mquinnton,"I looked up Golden State Warriors floor seats on Ticketmaster too (listed only as VIP section seating), and those seats are all like $3,000 - $5,000 per seat.If you look up Warriors V Pelicans on 4/7/18 the only remaining floor seats are resale via Ticketmaster at $5,265 per seat.I saw an article online this morning that Kevin Durant accidentally hit a basketball at a fan in the front row over the weekend. The guy who got hit sitting in the front row was Joseph Franzia, part of the family that owns Franzia Wine (before they sold it). So, that's the type of person who can afford that seat."
dtfzu10,edwardsamson,"Dude you'd be surprised. I landed row 2 floor seats for $490 during the 2015 playoffs in Boston versus Lebron. Just gotta check man!

dtfj7va,GunnyH1GHway,1200 seems really really high. there are like 1000 basketball games per season.
dtfdcq0,,"That seems really high. The cavaliers have floor seats for $780. Was actually considering buying them, just to knock that experience off my bucket list"
dtfe5yx,mquinnton,"Posted this above already but that was the cost I just found on Ticketmaster this morning to get that location floor seat. I wanted to see how much this guy spent to pull this stunt off, or rather, how much he would have blown if he had gotten kicked out for it. Was finding some other floor seats for about $900 but not in that location. You could also get a seat behind the bench or behind the basketball hoops for like $200-$500, but the video clearly showed the guy sitting front row on the floor."
dtfeqgb,,"Fair enough, im not a courtside seat aficionado so I couldnt tell you which area is most valuable. I figured next to the bench would be most expensive because youd get to be right next to all the players. I could see it being different though"
dtffjky,I_know_left,Wow. That'd be completely worth it to see LeBron.
dtfpcis,,"Yea, its against the spurs too. Definitely considering it"
dtftqza,I_know_left,"That's crazy. I was a Sonics fan all my life until they left, so the closest team is the Blazers. The ticket prices vary so much depending on who is coming into town. $40 seats turn into $200 seats if the Cavs, Warriors, etc. come into town. It's crazy. I'll have to look courtside and see how they compare, but I think any thing less than a G seems like a bargain."
dtfm5uc,PoorTank,Why would anyone want to sit behind the hoops? Wouldn't your view constantly be hindered?
dtfnn9x,mquinnton,"I personally wouldn't want to sit behind the hoops but people do, and they pay to sit there, so...."
dtfot9z,PoorTank,Yeah I've never sat there but the seats are more expensive than side view seats which confuses me lol.
dtfu3aa,Bobb_o,A little but you still are super close and those seats usually come with other perks.
dtfzq80,edwardsamson,warning: humble brag ahead.Every time I see posts like this with how much floor seats cost it just....floors me. I bought a 2nd row floor ticket to game 4 of the Celtics/Cavs series where they got swept (IT's first year there) for like $490. That's a Celtics Cavs playoff series with Lebron! How the fuck were they so cheap!?!?! Was it because I bought just 1?
dtfaux7,Spoofcaptain,"Not sure how accurate those numbers are, I just had floor seats on the second row for $250, can't imagine it's that much difference"
dtfc0p4,TheBigMcD,Second row floor seats? You might as well not even go to the gane at that point.
dtfc6pu,Spoofcaptain,"Not sure what you mean, I could see past the people in front of me if that's what you were implying. Best time of my life even though we lost lol. Got some awesome pics tooEdit: I don't get jokes, am stupid"

dtfcerv,unc0mm0n1,It's called a joke......
dtfbgkc,Careyingtheload,maybe it depends on the team they play?
dtfbljr,Spoofcaptain,"Ah yeah, most definitely."
dtfbqxl,SomeRandomProducer,It does.
dtfdbgs,mquinnton,"They were for a Friday game but just looked it up on Ticketmaster and directly buying from them was that price, $1,250. Looked them up today when I saw this story because I was wondering how much money this guy spent for a stunt that could have gotten him kicked out. Probably cheaper for a weekday game than a weekend night game. Ticket prices probably also change by the opponent."

dtf81fi,TomBradyWinsAgain,The important question - Did he make it?
dtfsp74,dro13,I'd be surprised if he did. That shot was kinda ugly. A+ for getting a shot off in the first place though.
dtfcrgb,chilepablo68,Maybe if he did more than one jumping jack he wouldn't have been found out.

Halfway back to the site, I had to shit so bad I knew I wasn't gonna make it back. I was in an area that was just a huge office park, so no gas stations, fast food joints, basically any type of public restroom. So I parked in front of some software company, grabbed one of the windows from the truck, strapped on my tool belt and l walked up to the secretary with the window and told her I was meeting “Scott in maintenance” (because every maintenance team has a “Scott”) to replace a window in one of the restrooms. She gave me directions to where the maintenance team hung out, let me into the main building, where I did a number on a random bathroom. Then I left, passed the secretary, pointed at the window and said “still must be half-asleep, I brought the wrong size window from the truck”. She laughed and said she'd see me in a second. Hopped in the truck and returned to work undetected."

dtgjx25,Chemical_Robot,Years ago. Maybe 15 years ago. A guy did this during a Manchester United champions league game. Went on to the pitch and actually lined up with the squad. I remember watching the game with my mate and we're like trying to figure out who this player is. He looks too old to be some unknown youth player making his debut. A few minutes later the he's gone and the commentary team mentioned he was an imposter. Fucking brilliant.Edit: he was called Karl Power.

dtfl108,highangler,My first nba game I went on the court as well. The 76ers could care less as long as you weren't center court or in the players way. At least it seemed that way. I played basketball all my life and ever since I was a kid all I wanted to do was touch a real nba ball. Call me weird but I have this thing where I want to associate things with touch. Like a turnbuckle from the wee. Always since I was kid I wanted to feel one. Anyway to my surprise the nba ball feels nothing like a ball you use in high school. It's like a rock and slippery leather rather than the padded kind the schools play with.
