dslplvo,KD_42,LeBrons face at 0:22 is the face of a man who's absolutely done with this shit
dslwbbv,daeve,At this point I'm pretty sure he's leaving Cleveland.
dslww4j,Chris_Isur_Dude,"With the way we've been playing this season and the FO doing nothing to make any moves, sadly I wouldn't blame him at this point"
dslxtha,Butterstuffednuts,Guy do you really think LeBron has time to make a mid season deal?
dslxw4i,Chris_Isur_Dude,"All star, Captain, Coach, GM, Ball boy. His plate is full but he'll get it done. LeGM never fails"
dsly5rh,Butterstuffednuts,Well by never you mean 3 out of 8 times.
dsly6hk,Chris_Isur_Dude,Well I meant more so to get a deal done
dsly7dt,Butterstuffednuts,3 out of 8 times he will get that deal done!Edit: what not a LeBron fan or something?
dslyd7l,LAM_O_,LeDeadJoke
dsly8rj,Blistersonmytoes,8 times that other teams haven't had
dsmp619,Butterstuffednuts,Almost like something something stolen Sonics team something something. Oooo sick burn.
dsm15vy,optimistic_racism,You forgot father of three
dsm637z,Pm_ur_cans_2me,Lebron to Milwaukee for Delly and cash considerations
dslxd49,,[deleted]
dslxfdg,Chris_Isur_Dude,Coming off? That was over 10 games ago buddy and after a rocky start to the season as well
dslxh5m,,[deleted]
dsm7bpr,VeryCanadian,I got a good chuckle out of this.
dsn34zw,chief_savage,This guy's having a good weekend lol
dsm27gq,,[deleted]
dsm27v7,Chris_Isur_Dude,"Don't call me pal, friend"
dsm0nis,GavinGT,LOL they've lost 8 of their last 11 games.
dsm8m64,Toomuchgamin,"Whew, thats Lakers numbers right there!"
dsmadea,oolongtea19,Wtf
dslyebp,KyrieSwerving617,If you think the front office is running the show you have a totally different view than I do. Lebron is had hand picked guys he wants on that team and it's going to come back to bite you guys in the ass when he leaves.
dsm7so2,groovyt0ny,Their first championship may have been worth it
dsnfmz5,flashypickle,Pretty sad that LeBron literally has to have the FO make blockbuster moves almost yearly in order to stay with a team.
dsm0kdm,Evil_Skip_Bayless,Real talk. If he doesn't commit long term so they can use the nets pick to trade for an all star then the cavs should trade him. Get all you can now or be left holding the bag like okc.
dsm0nmj,Bowler_2010,Kinda hard when he has a no trade clause
dsm0rj2,Evil_Skip_Bayless,"Trade him to a team he wants to go to. Sucks you'd have to gut the other team tho so yeh, I should delete this."
dsm0z2b,Bowler_2010,Lebron already stated at the beginning of the season there would be no circumstance he would waive the clause and allow a trade
dsm1sp2,Evil_Skip_Bayless,"Just can't see this team, the way it's built now even knowing it is integrating, besting the Warriors. Crowder isnt confident. Tt is in Kardashian kurse mode. Jr...jesus. The way the inevitably beat the Warriors was going at em and wearing steph down. Problem now is kd."
dsmf783,ATLKing123,"They were never going to beat the Warriors lol. LeBron plays very little defense now, IT is a liability everytime down the court. The Cavs are older, slower, and have more streaky shooters."
dsmg6ss,Evil_Skip_Bayless,Not without a bigtime defender slash scorer. You need 4 all stars to beat this team now. Even with best bench no one ia besting GS. Houston can try and shoot their way into the finals but harden is suspect now.
dsmgdrp,ATLKing123,"They wouldn't even with another guy like that. Too many guys who simply can't play defense anymore. LeBron can't guard anyone, Wade, IT, Love, etc all the same as well.A guy you described may make it a 5-6 game series, but they need A LOT more to even get to 7 imo ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
dsmgrz4,Evil_Skip_Bayless,"I'm not disagreeing, its sad actually that this is what it's come to. You need 4 all nba players to win a chip now. What's worse for lebrons legacy in your opinion? Join the Warriors, take vet min and win 6 rings or lose to them 6 more times?"
dsmh3hy,ATLKing123,"It is sad, I still somewhat blame ‚Äúthe decision‚Äù. Not solely due to LeBron's move but to the reaction it drew. It ultimately allowed KD's move (not a fan of, but players can do what they want of course). I don't think his legacy moves much either way (in your scenario joining the Warriors makes anything moving forward obsolete, although I doubt they'd even want him for chemistry reasons. At least with losing to them he can say he tried) but I tend to rank him lower than this sub for sure. I have him top 10, but we in an inflated era of stats and I think in 10 years we'll see that more clearly. Personally I think LeBron never wins another ring and there's a great chance the Celtics, Bucks, whoever begins coming out of the east next year (hell could this year tbh the way the Cavs look lately). Hopefully he can just enjoy the years he has left playing the game & not worry too much about ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù and chasing ghosts.I grew up watching MJ & Kobe a lot and toward the end (especially with Kobe) you could see the drive still but injuries, media fatigue, expectations, etc was tough to watch weigh on him as he knew he couldn't win anymore."
dsmhj79,Evil_Skip_Bayless,Lebron joined with 2 other all stars on a new team. They had to grow and learn how to win togther. KD joined an alresdy established champion. There is no comparison IMO.
dsmhn3f,ATLKing123,"Eh there's clearly a comparison, he still joined two all stars in his prime which hadn't really been seen before. But like I said my main point was that move enabled the KD move which has thrown the balance really out of whack. The only solution I see is doing away with ‚Äúmax contracts‚Äù."
dsm5k1r,Iamamansass,Yeah he's all like ‚Äú I created this mess but fuck it it's yours to deal with‚Äù
dsm7o6b,kousuke,r/ComingToConclusions
dsm9izi,aybbyisok,After a few bad games? /r/nba overreacts so much lmao.
dsm68d3,FALSEisALWAYScorrect,https://gfycat.com/ZealousSecondaryIndianspinyloach
dsm31wz,tookie_tookie,I love Lance
dslqcbu,Lakers-1st-Vols-2nd,Reggie Miller would be proud
dslx3xo,Drak_is_Right,He got to talk to Jordan a time or 2.
dsloimv,noodlehed,I hate Stephenson...until he's playing LeBron lol
dslorap,smegdaddy,"For some reason when Lance does something, it's just funny. I usually hate flopping and cheap shots but when it's Lance it's hilarious"
dslslbn,805431744,I think its because he overdoes it and its blatantly obvious
dslsxhd,TXhype,And its because lance just has one of those faces. Lol that sly devil look
dslwbuj,ZeroEnergy,The Chris Tucker type look
dsm5b2r,sudo_apt-get_booty,I thought he always looked like [Kel Mitchell](https://i0.wp.com/media2.slashfilm.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/kenanandkel-bedroom.jpg)
dsm6dct,lazybutter,He does have a high IQ
dslwqe3,ABSelect,Am I the only one who thinks Lance look like a chubby Chris Bosh
dslwwgf,TurboSexaphonic,fuck I can't unsee this. I can't believe you've done this.
dsm1eq1,,Fat Bosh
dsm8bcx,nomadofwaves,Doesn't look like a raptor to me.
dsmm77e,imdinni,"I don't completely see it. But, they have the same similar sunken eyes that makes me think you're onto something."
dslxgpn,thissistheN,He looks like welvyn the great
dslt094,tokomini,"I know it's the wrong sub for this comparison, but he's the equivalent of a Josh Norman/Cortland Finnegan in football. Matched up against the star player not just because he's good, but because he really, really pisses them off."
dslumf5,ATM14,except most of r/nfl hates Norman. I still like him though.
dsluxii,likekoolaid,I like Norman. But I get why people don't. With Lance I sincerely don't understand when people say they hate him
dslwk2q,Harry-Littlewood,Yeah it really blows me away too
dsmrx8y,CLTwolf,If you were a Hornets fan you'd understand
dsm8uve,sarmatron,"Well, there is the whole throwing his girlfriend down some stairs thing."
dsmfxpm,likekoolaid,"Lance? I don't think I heard about that. You got a link?Edit: I looked it up. I see he had quite the history of extracurriculars before the nba. I'd like to believe he turned it around, I'm clearly a fan of some troublesome players"
dsmg0od,sarmatron,http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5467630
dslvwzq,ptam,"Nah, Norman's cool. Finnegan's a fool tho."
dsm1y6t,Skip_To_My_Lou2,beats by dre
dsmcfqd,dananan,see what ya did there
dsmgzbv,,"I don't think they hate him, they just don't think he's worth the money."
dsltp6z,Drunken_Wanderer,"Harden does it and it's annoying as shit, every time. Probably because he flails about like a rag doll."
dslx0a8,Drak_is_Right,Harden gets the call though on the flop. Lance often doesn't.
dslt8w1,wikiman2001,You love Lance until he's facing your team lmao
dsltb86,RPDC01,He owns it - makes all the difference.
dslsuwu,ThisIsMy5thAcc,People say women have a Pussy Pass where they can get away with stuff because they're women. Lance has the Stephenson Pass.*if you have a better name I'm open to suggestions*
dsm4nvd,PoIIux,He's got that Lance Chance to get away with anything
dslw7eu,BBallChintu,LePass
dsm18h0,dego_frank,The blow n go
dslt1tz,noodlehed,Flop comp
dsmbadq,DaLyricalMiracleWhip,Pussy Pass still works
dsm6hsm,badhed,"He's not mad or mean, he's just playing his heart out and having fun. Lance being Lance."
dsm34te,NBAccount,Like that one time he nearly killed his girlfriend...LOL! Hilarious!
dslqte0,TuneHD,"I can't bring myself to hate Lance he's just too funny with stuff like this. I'll never get the mental image of him peeking after flopping out of my head, it's just peak Lance."
dsls0nb,farazormal,Peek lance
dsltzff,EwokMan,Reek Lance
dsltj07,idontknow_whatever,Or him slapping himself and flopping
dslzx3p,queryquest,Lance gives the viewership a glimpse at what the refs will accept as truth.
dsm4o2z,PoIIux,Got a vid of that?
dsm4v5l,idontknow_whatever,[Here] (https://youtu.be/l_BCgvKIO2w)Start at 0:32 for the slo-mo
dsm4x0f,PoIIux,"Wow, he is *the worst* :\"
dslwqjq,coffee_black_7,"I honestly can't explain why, but I absolutely love Lance Stephenson."
dsm7s5j,ha1fhuman,It's because he's like the comic relief in a serious basketball game. Kinda like if you put a Harlem Globetrotter out in the NBA court and he starts doing funky stuff like spinning the ball and tossing it off the opponent's head.Dude is just an entertainer/clown.
dslsrsc,beefoftheweek,I don't see how anyone could hate him
dsltat0,DescendantofHuangdi,"Oh I don't know, maybe just the fact that he [pushed his girlfriend down a flight of stairs, grabbed her and hit her head on the bottom step] (http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=5467630)."
dslwmfc,woodelf,"I did way more research on this earlier today than I care to admit, cuz I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt and find something recent where he apologizes or makes amends. But nope nothing out there"
dsmc70h,piglet24,"I remember his first stint in Indiana, Lance gave a lot of props to Larry Bird for helping him get his shit together in life. Larry took a chance drafting him after that incident and focused on getting his mind right. While there isn't a public apology from Lance regarding his assault case, I'd like to think he's a better person now."
dsmcak8,PKViking,When he out of the league do u think he stays that better person?
dsm1q0z,TheTurtler31,Oh. Fuck him then.
dsmkg1a,ILOVEBASKETBALL24_8,This gets forgotten way too often. Fuck Lance Stephenson
dsluefg,,[removed]
dslugha,DescendantofHuangdi,"Yes, call bullshit on an actual news article rofl. Braindead."
dsm8xbx,Esterthemolester,but are u salty?
dslx4pt,Voltron76,White Knight Alert.
dsly1f6,DescendantofHuangdi,"I actually disrespect women on many occasions but this is beyond scummy. Violence aint the answer, id like to bash your head in and see how you like it."
dslycz3,Voltron76,"You don't know the whole story and weren't there when it happened. Just another speculative white knight internet though guy and now you're going to bash my head in, what a fucking hypocrite of epic proportions. LOL come on man."
dslzb4g,DescendantofHuangdi,"What's so speculative of pushing someone down a tall flight of stairs and then hitting her head while she was down? Rofl stop while you can. Im the opposite of a white knight and again, see how you would like it if I bashed your head in. Aint nothing ""white knight"" about being against violence. Just imagine getting your head bashed in and feeling the pain and blood. Imagine it you kid. Imagine me bashing your skull in. Imagine the fear as I hammer down on your face. I'd like to bash your face in and see how you like it then. I want to see your reaction and I want you to call me a white knight when it happens. And when you scream out in pain ill just laugh at you and bash you until you fall unconscious. White knight eh?"
dsmaa3w,xomuncho,"Also to note, from the ESPN article it would appear that the witnesses were the girl's friends. He could have been falsely accused but unless we were there we cannot really be sure."
dsm0fss,Voltron76,"You are taking it as fact that he did this? You were there? Wow holy shit my speculation comment was spot on! You're an investor in TRON!!!! The most speculative shit coin ever, Holy Shit LMFAO!!! You're going to lose your shirt if you haven't already bro!"
dsme6ke,DescendantofHuangdi,"I got in at 1 cent and sold half my position when it reached 25 cents so I am essentially playing with house money. Tron has treated me well, dont feel salty you didnt get in before the hype train already left."
dsmhlwg,Voltron76,But your still pumping it? There is no substance behind this coin.
dsmi3iy,DescendantofHuangdi,"Lol there is substance and their team keeps on growing. Justin may shill his own coin but when has he actually not delivered what he promised? Look at many of the coins in the top 10, not many have an actual working product (iota). Everything is overvalued right now but at least justin is recruiting legit team members and engaging in partnerships. Why would they join Tron if they weren't actually working on the project? Also justin clearly has many connections in china and that's a huge market. TRX has the potential to be the entertainment platform of choice for china in the future."
dslstoj,noodlehed,See flair above \^ \^ for deets
dslrp0y,DunnAndDusted,Still hate him at that point but enjoy the entertainment he provides.
dslvsop,Starcitsoon2,Anyone else and they are considered a punk. Lance gets a pace because he is not harden good but it is awesome.
dslq599,jovijovi99,"Lance ""LeBron Stopper"" Stephenson"
dsls1zq,DunnAndDusted,"Except he's never really stopped him, he's just pissed him off."
dsm65k3,uplandsrep,Good enough for me!
dslrt6q,BigMerlin4108,Except in the playoffs.
dslpzb4,maricircus,Lol @ Lebron grabbing the ref to show what Lance did to him earlier. THAT should've been a tech right instead.
dslrtdl,noerapenalty,This is what I thought they were calling. I'm confused about the rule re: touching refs. How does it compare to Livingston's?
dslsmyr,isavemorethanirape,"Yeah I thought touching a ref is an automatic ejection.Ref was prob like please stop touching me, I'm uncomfortable and I really don't wanna eject you"
dslx6y8,FahCough,"Lots of players touch the refs when talking to them or just to get their attention. It's not an automatic ejection, but doing it in a threatening way can be an ejection."
dslxrfk,BoshasaurusChris,Imagine if that time joey crawford ran into the player he ejected him too lmao
dsma2bg,Doorknob11,It would have been ridiculous but nobody would have been surprised.
dsms3fe,Weegemonster5000,"Might have been one of Crawdog's better calls, especially if it was in the playoffs."
dsmbum4,PanqueNhoc,"""Not in front of everyone Bron Bron"""
dsm03f6,benson822175,"I've seen players come in contact with refs all the time, it definitely isn't an automatic ejection. The nature and context of Livingston's contact with the red obviously warranted his ejection but contact with a ref is not an automatic ejection"
dsmdsx6,noerapenalty,For sure. I know they do the playful butt pat all the time and that's very different. I thought Lebron's this time was a little aggressive and the ref's face seemed kinda taken aback
dsm1qvw,TheTurtler31,If you're the biggest star in the league you get away with a lot. MJ once punched Reggie Miller or choked him (can't remember which) and Reggie Miller was the one who got thrown out lol
dsm3dce,MWisBest,> MJ once punched Reggie Miller or choked him (can't remember which) and Reggie Miller was the one who got thrown out lol[Sauce on that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdloEHSgzSM) for anybody interested lmao.
dsn1u1n,Justice502,"I dunno I'm with MJ, Miller tried to be slick there and got shut down."
dsmo5k9,Realniggafasho,It looks like a pretty normal physical play until Miller wraps Jordan up lol not seeing this as one sided as mentioned
dsmuj8q,MWisBest,"It wasn't so much that the fight was one-sided, it was the result after it. MJ should've been ejected too.MJ was suspended for a game and fined $10,000 by the NBA after it, and Reggie got a $6,000 fine but no suspension (which, admittedly, was probably because he was ejected). The point is the refs on the floor will let superstars get away with a LOT of stuff that would get anybody else tossed. Sauce: http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/13/sports/basketball-late-call-jordan-suspended-and-fined.htmlProps to the NY Times for having working online links to an article that's 25 years old!"
dsmbgk5,earnedmystripes,Pooh Richardson sighting!
dsmbag2,himynameismatt13,And MJ got a free throw
dsm3c3x,tb3278,https://youtu.be/qdloEHSgzSM
dsmny02,silverscraper,Wow. Thought you were joking..
dslsc55,youblewwit,"That didn't look like what Lebron was doing. The ref's body jerked after Lebron pushed him out the way. If it was a lesser player, he would have been ejected."
dsltkho,,[deleted]
dsm25ul,AfrikanCorpse,Lebron has a whole different rule book.
dslyja7,bogdan_bogdan,LeGoldenBoy gets the most leeway out of any player in the league and has been for many years nowdude can touch and scream at refs all he wants and not get a tech. Seriously ridiculous
dsmo72n,Realniggafasho,Barely gets called for common fouls
dsmb06j,Collier1505,Weird way to spell Draymond

dsls8d7,Rip-pc,thats Anger Managment lmao
dslsd7w,abothanspy,Ahh fuck
dslsvu5,TheBestJerry_TheBest,that would not have fit in the departed lol
dslt0xd,abothanspy,His character in that movie was evil and intense but still had some of his typical kind of kookiness. I think it was plausible.
dsltm3v,Rip-pc,if you havent seen anger management its a hilarious movie
dsltnug,abothanspy,"Indeed, I wish Sandler's new movies were that funny."
dslveks,,cofax movie was pretty good tbh
dslwnmm,conyeighwest,this has been movie reviews with /u/tittycocks
dslwrmd,,and your user is how i pronounce to siri that i want to listen to some god damn CON YEIGH WEST right now
dslzw92,misterplinkett,Are you implying that Jack & Jill isn't a comedic masterpiece?
dsm4hvm,HeWhoLovesSpaghetti,I'm pretty sure he was referring to Nicholson's character in The Departed
dsm167u,LEGO_Joel,A couple snappy edits could make The Departed into a sequel hahaha
dslt72x,materics,Bahaha
dsm2u39,mastercylinder2,Jack is our mascot though. And that's not the departed either!

dsm1uzq,TheTurtler31,I mean he deserved it lol
dsm38cx,BoobyBrown,Stephenson deserved the push or Lebron deserved the tech? Stephenson sticks his thumb into Lebron's side
dsmb5aw,leslieohene,Yes.
dslohzw,watdapau,Lance shines against lebron. Born ready killing bron bron
dslv43n,harleq01,"Lance needs lebron like the joker needs batman. Without lebron, lance would just be an unfunny clown. Edit: this is probably the wittiest comment i've ever made and no one will notice it"
dslvaxx,OsoDePaulie,"I got you, fam. Edit: i didn't notice your flair at first, but, whatever. I still got you."
dslosnl,DydoDeChamp,aye yes like those times he tried to pester lebron in the playoffs then lost lol
dsls5hx,watabadidea,"TBF, the refs let Wade get away with shit like giving Lance a flying elbow to the side of the head at midcourt without even calling him for a common foul during the game.If you let Lance flying elbow guys in the head without any punishment being attached to it other than a postgame flagrant-one, I'm pretty sure the Pacers would have taken a least one of those series, but I could be wrong."
dslx8ym,ColeTrickleVroom,"I remember Stephenson threw one down and said something to Wade, Wade totally bitched out, threw his hands in the air and whined to the ref for a call. Was one of the all time ""I'm a pussy"" moves I've ever seen."
dslzpvf,Legendary824,"I think I remember that, was it this?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdvKExnQ-P8"
dsm0abq,ColeTrickleVroom,That's the one. What a bitch.
dsm1suw,TheTurtler31,That whole team was pussyville centralExcept for Birdman lol
dsm3ga8,Trlcks,Ud?
dsmmez0,NasSon53,He flexed and said ‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù The refs gave him his 2nd tech and tossed him. Probably the 2nd stupidest ejection I've ever seen (1st is Duncan getting tossed for laughing on the bench)
dsn230t,Joabyjojo,Lance only beats on his girlfriends though so
dsn5ivz,watabadidea,"OOC, do *you* actually care about the alleged assault from 2010 or are you just pretending to be offended by it so you can take a shot at Stephenson?"
dsn8521,Joabyjojo,No. I'm not 'pretending' to dislike Lance for beating the shit out of his girlfriend and refusing to ever apologise for it. Jesus
dsnmw1l,watabadidea,">No. I'm not 'pretending'...If you say so.I mean, to me, when a woman gets thrown down a fucking flight of stairs and you see it as an opportunity to make a snide one-liner on reddit, it gives off the impression that you really don't take her pain and trauma very seriously. Instead, it gives the impression that you just don't like Stephenson and you see the shit his ex had to go through as something for you to exploit to take easy shots for at Lance.Seriously, re-read your original post to me. To someone that doesn't know you and has never met you, do you think it comes of as actually sympathetic to the shit she went through?Or you think it comes off as less concerned about respecting how horrible the experience was for her and more concerned about how you can exploit it to get a witty quip out of it to post to reddit?I know how it came off to me."
dsnrzyt,Joabyjojo,"I don't believe life has room to be severe about something all the time, and I'm personally quite removed from the situation so I'm ok with off-handedly bringing up his terrible actions to occasionally remind others he's a dirtbag. It's not supposed to be sympathetic to the victim, simply condemning of Stephenson.The worldview you've hinted at doesn't allow for any humour about any tragedy -- not that my flippant remark was 'humour' -- which I think only makes bleak things bleaker.If my goal was to remind you that Lance is a piece of shit, then upon re-reading my original post I find that my mission was accomplished. Context clues should indicate that my post is not supposed to be disrespectful towards his victim, but people interpret context however they like. There isn't much I can do about that."

It's not supposed to be sympathetic to the victim, simply condemning of Stephenson.So, to be clear, your stance is:* You don't feel that throwing someone down a flight of stairs needs to be taken seriously all the time* You are far removed from the situation so you are fine bringing it up off-handedly to push your opinion* You post was in no way intended or interested in showing even a shred of sympathy towards the victimCan you look at that and see why I'd get the impression that you might not really care about the alleged domestic violence and are just pretending to care so you have something to bitch about?>The worldview you've hinted at doesn't allow for any humour about any tragedy...Well that's not true. I mean, let's apply a little context and perspective here. You made a one-line post on reddit. I laid out why it seemed like it *might* indicate that you didn't really care about the alleged domestic violence. Somehow, you've turned that into me hinting at an entire ""worldview"" on *any* humor about *any* tragedy.Seems like a bit of a reach to me.>If my goal was to remind you that Lance is a piece of shit, then upon re-reading my original post I find that my mission was accomplished. Not really. I mean, you certainly reminded me that he *was* a piece of shit almost a decade ago when he was 19 and (allegedly) did this. As for him being a piece of shit *today?* I don't know man. Maybe he is, maybe he isn't, but I don't think something he did when he was 19 defines the rest of his life.>Context clues should indicate that my post is not supposed to be disrespectful towards his victim, but people interpret context however they like.I didn't say it was disrespectful. I just said that it gives the impression that you don't really give a shit about the victim or what she went through or what happened to her. If you don't really give a shit about the victim and what happened to them, then it raises the question about why you brought it up in the first place.If you only brought it up because you looked at a violent, traumatic situation and saw an opportunity exploit it push your own opinion and agenda, then that might say something about you."
dsolu3a,Joabyjojo,"> Can you look at that and see why I'd get the impression that you might not really care about the alleged domestic violence and are just pretending to care so you have something to bitch about?I can see how if you skew anything away from its context you can interpret things however you like. I actually already addressed that. But here we are, with you still attempting to remove context to make me feel bad for a one-liner. Here you are, still on this one subject even though I clearly stated my position, attempting to use domestic violence as a weapon in some sort of internet posting joust that you constructed yourself and now intend on winning. Some might read your posts and think that you don't really care about Lance Stephenson's victim and instead only care about winning this argument you started and then have sustained on your own.> Well that's not true. I mean, let's apply a little context and perspective here. You made a one-line post on reddit. I laid out why it seemed like it might indicate that you didn't really care about the alleged domestic violence. Somehow, you've turned that into me hinting at an entire ""worldview"" on any humor about any tragedy.> Seems like a bit of a reach to me.This is rich coming from a person who has determined that I am uncaring towards victims of domestic violence based on a single sentence comment in an nba forum.> Not really. I mean, you certainly reminded me that he was a piece of shit almost a decade ago when he was 19 and (allegedly) did this.Yes we get it you (allegedly) think the victim lied about it. You've made that (allegedly) clear numerous times. Nobody couches these things in words like allegedly unless they're scared of being sued for libel (this is not a newspaper so you can't be) or if they think the accused is innocent and the victim is a liar. Makes me wonder whether you actually care about the victim blah blah blah.Regardless, not even a decade has passed. People don't deserve to be vilified for their mistakes forever, but I think beating the ever-loving shit out of someone who trusts you earns you the piece of shit label for a bit longer than 7 years or whatever it's been.> it raises the question about why you brought it up in the first place.Except I already answered that. You quoted it in your own post. You said it's been at least 5 years since he's beaten the shit out of a girlfriend so he's a cool guy who you love.I'm not gonna respond from here on out. You know my position. Lance Stephenson is a piece of shit. Not enough time has passed for him to get away with it. I don't think it's disrespectful to his victim to remind people about this fact via one-liners. If you (allegedly) think anything else, so be it."
dslqxsh,TuneHD,You mean when LeBron had 2 other superstars?
dslsffi,DydoDeChamp,Are you really even trying to compare lance and lebron as equals hahaEdit: not even mad about the downvotes the responses are actually pretty funny haha
dslsloc,CasuallyHuman,I think it's a reasonable debate.
dslt33a,MiaCannons,If Lance had two more all stars you could make a good argument he doesn't only go to 7 straight finals but he wins 7 straight too.
dslvnnq,Lavar_Balls_Mom,I know we're just joking around but he did have two other all stars in PG and Hibbert. Hibbert did turn into a ghost after that second all star selection though lol
dsm1fac,Rasalghul92,"Ah yes, I remember when the Lakers signed the Ghost of Roy Hibbert."
dslupzz,ATM14,"IKR! Lance is obviously much better than Lebron, smh..."
dslwpvf,TuneHD,"I wouldn't insult Lance's greatness like that, but the point is you're acting like Lance's team losing isn't because one team is insanely stacked"
dslokcj,,[deleted]
dslonar,KyleRaynerGotSweg,"You clearly haven't seen how Indy fans react when Lance does anything, no one gets the crowd going the way he does."

dsm7fxh,badhed,[Lance's Wiki Page](https://i.imgur.com/18lSv5J.jpg)
dslq959,tripbin,Yet another game where Bron puts hands all over refs and gets nothing.
dslx5p1,Drak_is_Right,"though if Lebron had shoved the ref to the ground for getting between him and Lance, Lebron would still get nothing."
dsmoi58,Realniggafasho,He can stand in the middle of 5th ave and push a ref and get away with it
dslthsu,8placeribbon,"LeBron definitely had his hands on the official but contact between them started because the ref got between him and Lance, so it's not like LeBron walked up to the ref and put his hands on him like your comment is making it sound. This happens all the time with refs breaking up a scuffle, not a big deal."
dsmf1hh,natetheproducer,Oh god Cavs fans are reaching maximum delusion. Level 9000 super sayain delusion. If Lebron murdered a baby on camera y'all would be like ‚Äúno but look he tripped and someone nudged him and a gust of wind came through and the baby instigated him anyway and if you look at it from another angle...etc.‚Äù
dsmj1i8,Hoops_Junkie2,LMAO facts
dslogm9,sam2421,Stephenson literally sticks his thumb into Lebron's stomach. The dude is seriously fucking mental
dslwdaq,couldntchoosesn,Am I the only one that thinks this is probably somewhat common?
dsm27la,gettinDINWIDDIT,It's extremely common lol. Players have talked about doing this for ages and it's really not a big deal.
dslt6y4,,"Seriously, come on. I know Lebron puts up with a lot of shit, but even as a high school soccer player kids did way worse shit to me than sticking their thumb into my stomach."
dslylfk,bogdan_bogdan,"seriously lol, is that what Lebron got all pissy about? Dude is so sensitive but we should've realized that when he snitched to the media about Draymond calling him a bitchthat's why I don't get why people think Lebron could've played in the 80's and 90's if he's whining this much about a thumb to the stomach jesus christ"
dsmj8eu,PM_ME_WHATEVERR,He gave Lance a light push after Lance did that. I don't think thats getting pissy at all.
dsmspyq,DeKobe-DeBryant,"He gave Lance a little push after it. You're acting like he started to complain to the ref about what Lance did. He was complaining because they started going to review what LeBron did as if his action was the first one.If anything, Lance's the bitch for exaggerating the shove and putting his hands up looking for a call."
dsn1yr6,DesertBrandon,"The cavs are on a slump so this place is going to become 2011 Facebook. I mean look at all these comments that are nothing more than ""LeBitch."""
dsms8i3,Weegemonster5000,"I only played high school ball, and on a pretty bad team. When I was a Freshman, a Senior post guy was showing me how he gets other bigger players off their game. Yeah he sticks his finger in and around their butt hole. He never got called out during a game for it either."
dslonhe,Niirai,I really don't mind the tech but the refs blatantly disregarding Lance's bullshit is sending a strong message. After like 3 minutes of review too...
dslp1fl,jeric13xd,Lance blew in their ears
dsltcyz,PrancingDonkey,That shit was glorious.
dslqn2o,deisoswagger,smh at Lance getting all these superstar treatment from the refs
dslsw6x,Niirai,One of the ref's jobs should be to suss out a situation when it's escalating. These two players have a storied history and punishing the guy who is being instigated upon is just a bad call. Just give a damn double tech that refs love so much.I'm wouldn't be convinced either from the tape that Lance was actually pinching Lebron if it wasn't these 2 particular players. Just trade free throws letting them know enough with the bullshittery.
dslumft,SuburbanLegend,The instigator getting away with it and the person reacting getting called is like the oldest thing in basketball.
dslsubb,Ferromagneticfluid,"That is honestly part of sports. Everyone has been defended by a guy that is constantly trying to rattle you by pulling on your jersey, poking you, fouling you out of eye of the ref. Refs can't catch everything."
dsme27s,KonigSteve,It shouldn't be.
dsmwfde,SwoopingAndHooping,Why not?
dsm81xd,PolioHappened,They reviewed it though.
dsltcyy,RPDC01,There's no rule against being annoying. Do you want them to be prohibited from talking to each other as well?
dsme34r,KonigSteve,There's definitely a rule against jaming your fingers in people..
dslqntw,MChill17,"Oh and the other 20 bs calls in their favor, that also sent the same strong message"
dslqtn3,Juicer41,Give me a break. How many free throws did the Cavs shoot? How many the Pacers shoot? Keep crying about the refs though.
dslraul,MChill17,Lance literally jumped on top of Korver for a rebound.Lance didn't get a tech for completely instigating lebronKevin was mugged going for an offensive rebound with a couple minutes left. His arm was completely held Jr smith got called for a phantom foul where he literally did not touch lance Stephenson on that spin moveEarlier on that same play Thaddeus Young completely pushed off on Jose Calderon to create space (which would've been called on lebron or a cavs player all day)Look we shouldn't have even been in that position. I'm not saying Reffing cost us the game. But Or team is not very good right now and we're playing really badly. So it's even tougher when bs Reffing is added to the mix.
dsmk37g,sayroksho,"You can't complain you don't get calls, that's just bs you get more calls then you should to begin with."
dslynpp,,[deleted]
dslzb7k,MChill17,Yeah obviously lol. I wouldn't make comments like this if I cared about karma. I just got downvoted so hard bc I seemed super salty. Which I was tbh
dsm082e,,Cavs fans sensing the beginning of the end
dslrqmg,DunnAndDusted,Lance still should have been tossed.
dslolvm,PaulGeorgeHill,"Wait when he put his hand on his side like everyone does in the NBA? Is there another view? I don't see it at all, am i just a homer going insane?"
dslon9k,sam2421,Mate watch Lebrons jersey fold into itself
dslr1o2,noodlehed,Man these Nike jerseys are getting worse and worse
dslwlf0,TetsuoS2,"Self-folding clothes aren't exactly ""getting worse""."
dslxns3,arsenemugabe,"you must work for nike's marketing dept, that's a great spin."

dslv18r,harleq01,"Breaking news, clothing moves when applying finger pressure"

dslsgjv,yoyowatup,"Look how his jersey crumbles inward, as soon as he jabs him lebron reacts, I don't think lebron shoved him just for touching him"
dslsqog,ChrisHarperMercer,You mean right where the shirt naturally is folding?
dslsv1o,yoyowatup,The second his thumb presses lebron instinctively pushes him. Also notice how Lebron touched the exact spot his thumb presses.
dslt4mm,ChrisHarperMercer,Biggest cry baby in the league
dslt7q7,yoyowatup,Okay lol
dsm82lr,badhed,LeBron is so damn touchy. What's up wit dat?
dslrfop,here_2_downvote_u,"Hijacking here, but this is a huge deal. In the book by Scott Ostler on how to cheat in sports if you grind your thumb on a opposing players back/hip you can wear them down physically much faster."
dslq7ai,The_One_X,"I see what they are talking about, but they are making a much bigger deal of it than it is."
dslqwbo,I_ama_Borat,"Would you be saying this if Lance wasn't on your team? You shouldn't be able to pinch, jab or tickle people without consequence. Dat ain't basketball. Having said that, I hope Stephenson never stops his annoying ways. He can truly get under players skins, especially lebron's."
dslte0n,8placeribbon,> tickleGame ~~7~~ 4 NBA Finals Draymond Green ejected for tickling LeBron James
dslu0g9,The_One_X,"Yes, because I can tell when people are reacting to Lance based more on reputation than on what actually happened. I am not a Lance fanboy, I was happy when the Pacers didn't re-sign him."
dslqnpp,TJWA,I don't see anything here but I wouldn't be surprised at all just because it's Lance. But I don't see it here at all.
dslrs74,DunnAndDusted,"Not really, anyone that's objective knows its just classic Lance bullshit. He should have been tossed."
dsltpv2,The_One_X,"If Lance should have been tossed for that, Lebron should have been tossed for physically moving the ref. If you think anything Lance did was in any way worse than what Lebron did you are not objective."
dslu5nu,DunnAndDusted,Lance is a piece of shit and should have been tossed.
dsluav8,The_One_X,My point exactly.
dslue4y,DunnAndDusted,Glad you agree.
dslpujy,RustedWheel,Lance pushes his thumb hard into LeBron. And that's not the same as a pinch. You can see LeBron feel at the spot with his right hand after he pushes Lance off him.
dslonax,,The cavs commentators said it so it must be true
dslrk02,BigMerlin4108,This is my first year where I'm really tired of the Cavs announcers. Especially AC.

dslon60,ralphrackstraw,"I never thought any player would compete with Metta World Peace for ""most insane player in the league."" Stephenson is giving it an honest attempt though."
dslpnak,trundgot,Lol you guys are being so overdramatic
dslr8ga,thedude596,I love how people on this sub act like they want 90's basketball back and then act like this when a player pokes somebody with his thumb lol

dslrxx0,thedude596,No I'd actually never thought of that before
dsls4c7,DunnAndDusted,Cute.

dsls027,QotSAMario64,Or Rodman
dslou29,cud50,"For getting in lebrons head? Jesus Christ comparing him to Ron Artest give me a break. As a Pacer fan, trust me. Artest was insane, Lance has annoying antics. Big difference"
dslp4sg,MrDinglebop,"Remember, putting a thumb on LeBron is equal to climbing into the crowd and mortal kombating audience members lmao!"

dslr6fb,MJRocky,Bruh 90% of the people on here weren't alive for Rodman
dslsqs3,,"Welp, I officially feel old. I was always number 91 in baseball because I loved Rodman so much!"
dsltra5,Drunken_Wanderer,"Ding. Or Michael, which explains how a lot of them actually could possibly think LeBron is better than Jordan with a straight face. You were barely out of the womb when MJ was doing his thing, and it was a MUCH different/tougher league."

dsm91v3,FuckTheGSWarriors,\>much tougher league\>illegal defense existingpick one
dsm6hk3,JabbaWockyy,What is with this notion that Lebron wouldn't be busting fuckin heads in the 90s. Dudes a proven tank.
dsltsk6,ChoppingMallKillbot,Way to make the other 10% feel fucking old
dslv072,MJRocky,"lol my bad, was just trying to illustrate how the nostalgia effect makes you remember only the good stuff and diminish the negatives. Shoutout to you and /u/ztando tho, we need to respect these old heads (meant strictly out of respect lol) out here and try to glean as much knowledge about the game (and life in general) out of them to truly move forward.

dslr7u9,KamikazeMack,"My comment is clearly towards the ones that called him a prick, weak, bitch, etc. if I cared about karma I'd be trying to post highlights"
dslwo1t,TuneHD,Then your comment is just stupid if you think everyone holds the same belief lmao
dslwvwa,LeGilbert,"Y'all lay off, he don't care bout karma y'all"
dsmmtp0,KungFu_Kenny,And some people also called Rodman those same things... it's no different for Lance. .. or Draymond (you get the point)

dsmbq5u,earnedmystripes,I love ~~lamp~~ Lance
dsltme1,ciphhh,He's a very good irritant. So easy to hate like a good movie villain. I think he's just a bit too immature to be reliably effective in playoffs.
dslosbs,welchie98,"It's Lance just pinching Lebron is what gets this sub mad. Like, it's petty bullshit and it would get anyone pissed off."

dslpywo,gettinDINWIDDIT,"Nah man that's just a smart veteran move, but this is brutal and over the lineThe top comments in here are so over the top just because it's Lebron. ‚ÄúLance is such a fucking bitch‚Äù ‚ÄúSeriously fucking mental‚Äù lol wtf"

dslzpn3,pacer4life,damn well said
dslzrsi,Sprizzo11,Check out the idiot who responded to this before you.
dslz9ys,J-E-G-V-L,Embiid doesnt do shit like this. He tweets ans talks and hes one of the best centers in the NBA.
dslzdhk,Sprizzo11,I said Embiid wants to be this guy. Never said he is this guy. 76ers fan being salty about nothing as usual
dslzn3v,J-E-G-V-L,"Lol im not in no way affiliated with the 76ers. I literally cheer for KU basketball players and Embiid is the one im rooting for rn. Last year I had a Kings flair because they uses to be from KC, where im from and had Mclemore. I love when people assume shit. And how is Embiid trying to be this guy, when Stephenson has never memed other NBA players, and Embiid hasnt blown in ears/flop/press thumbs in peoples sides? They are two completely different trolls your ego is just too fucking big to admit it."
dslzp2h,Sprizzo11,Trolling? You have a fucking 76ers flair you idiot. Of course I'm gonna assume that you're a fan.
dslzs1m,J-E-G-V-L,"Damn, good luck assuming in the real world bud, where people where jerseys all the time for teams they dont support. Also I edited my post so probably read the rest of it and give me a concrete answer."
dslzwlf,Sprizzo11,"I'm sorry that I assumed you liked the 6ers because of your flair. If you want to say you're exclusively a Embiid fan, then put that next to the 76ers you moron. Pretty damn confusing that you're on r/nba , but don't watch the NBA except for Embiid. What a joke. I'm like 90% sure you're trolling, but on the off chance you aren't, then you might have a mental deficiency. Embiid wants to be that guy who gets in other players heads from what I can tell. Stephenson is great at that and Embiid would love being that good at annoying other players. Just saying Lance is an expert at this while Embiid isn't that good at it. Why do you take offense to such little things?"
dsm04ut,J-E-G-V-L,"""Embiid is trying to be this guy."" Is a bit fucking dumb, dont you think? That insinuates that Embiid is quite literally, trying to be Stephenson. Maybe I should be a little more specific but clearly you suffer from the same ""mental deficiency"" bud. All I was doing was correcting you, clearly you have no idea the different types of trolls within the universe, which is probably why you think Im a troll when im trying to help you fix your uhhh ""troll deficiency"". Yeah I like that."
dsm07c7,Sprizzo11,"r/iamverysmartJesus Christ man. Do you realize how damn stupid you sound right now? This is kind of sad that you keep on going on rants about a tiny thing I said that no normal person should take offense to. Perfect material for that sub. Man, some people just want to be angry. What a sad, sad life that would be."
dsm0ci6,J-E-G-V-L,Nah. Im not offended at all. Im literally trolling you at this point. Youre just too fucking dumb to realize it
dsm0cx6,Sprizzo11,Buddy. I pointed out that you were trolling in the first response.
dsm0hct,J-E-G-V-L,I wasnt trolling though. I literally was trying to correct you but since you cant seem to get it Im fucking with you at this point.
dsm0k0v,Sprizzo11,"But you just said you were trolling dude. I do get it. You're a moron who took offense to me calling Embiid a Lance Stephenson wannabe. Then, you took offense to when I ""assumed"" you were a 76ers fan (check the flair). I hope that one was a troll. You only said you were trolling because you realized where you were going was a dead end and made no sense. Never have I seen a more reactionary person, trolling or not."
dsm0qt1,J-E-G-V-L,Yes I realized this was a dead end after I figured out I was talking to a brick fucking wall. Youre so full of it yet im the /r/iamverysmart guy.
dsm0vtl,Sprizzo11,Sorry that I'm such a brick wall. You seem really open to my opinions.
dsm0sr1,Sprizzo11,"There's a reason you're being downvoted dude. It's because what you're saying makes no sense and that comment about the literal meaning of ""wanting to be Stephenson"" was a very r/iamverysmart answer. Textbook."
dsm10ej,J-E-G-V-L,"Ironically, youre the only one downvoting me, and 1 other guy maybe. No one cares enough to read through these replies so stop trying to make it seem like you have some sort of huge crowd behind you. Second off, all you had to say was ""I didnt literally mean it"" because my original post was in no way rude, yet here we are because you want to talk shit. You are weak minded."
dsm1api,Sprizzo11,"I never said it was rude, it just came off in a ""I'm really smart"" type of way. Your original point just made no sense. I thought you said you were done? You just keep coming back for more. Don't think I have a big crowd behind me. Just saying more people seem to disagree with you than me."
dsm1gvu,J-E-G-V-L,"No, Im saying your rude. I see your reading comprehension isnt the finest. Also, literally no one is following this. At this point we are just downvoting eachother so exactly how many people do you see disagreeing with me? Stop bullshitting yourself. Also im not stopping anytime soon. I cant sleep and this is entertaining."
dsm1k7t,Sprizzo11,"I understand exactly what your saying. You started rambling about some bullshit that made no sense and then started trolling once you realized it was stupid. I really don't know if you're just an idiot or a troll, but this isn't very fun anymore. Just don't take offense to things so easily. That's it."
dsm1p3d,J-E-G-V-L,Me taking offense to things? Lmao bud you threw the first stone while living in a glass house.
dsm1qmi,Sprizzo11,You took offense first man. I said something about you being a 6ers fan and the you started telling me to stop assuming you were a 6ers fan even though your flair says you are one. That's what I'm referring to.
dsm1wdp,J-E-G-V-L,"I didnt get pissy, I corrected you. You literally assumed I was a sixers fan while taking a shot at the sixers, while I am literally not a sixers fan. You assumed that jab would throw me off balance when I didnt give a fuck. I then responded telling you why my flair is this and for you to stop assuming. You then called me a troll and a dumbass in the same comment. What are you getting on about? This is your fuck up and you still arent admitting to it."
dsm1y05,Sprizzo11,Then why do you have a plain 76ers flair? Why not put Embiid in it? Any rational person would assume a person with a goddamn 76ers flair is a 76ers fan. You're delusional if you think otherwise in that situation
dsm22rz,J-E-G-V-L,Ok. I get it. Theres a group of people assume you are a fan of a team when you have the flair without a name next too it. Gosh darn it I will change it right away!
dsm0ezq,SoulOfSelesnya,"""im not retarded, just trolling u bro! haha #rekt"""
dsm0ift,J-E-G-V-L,"Nah. I wasnt trolling til my last response. But yeah go ahead because the guy is completely fucking wrong on his ""Embiid is trying to be this guy"" statement."
dsm0o59,Sprizzo11,Pretty easy to troll once you realize you lost. Please say you were trolling earlier. Saying that your not a 76ers fan even though you you have the flair is the dumbest thing I've seen on this sub in a while.
dsm0pbe,J-E-G-V-L,Oh ok. Didnt realize this was about winning or losing. I was informing you that you are wrong and you have yet to come up with a rebuttle that 100% proves you are right.
dsm0rdw,Sprizzo11,Not about winning or losing. Just said it's easy to troll when you realize what you're saying is a dead end. I am informing you that you are wrong if you want to play that card. You give u/givelonzoachance a run for dumbest user on this sub.
dsm145y,GiveLonzoAChance,dog that was pretty mean wtf
dsm19fv,Sprizzo11,You're a troll dude. I know those aren't your real opinions.
dsm1a0p,GiveLonzoAChance,ok keep believing that lmao

dsm1i1x,J-E-G-V-L,Says the guy that thinks poking sides and making tweets are the same type of trolling. This isnt even a basketball thing. Its a trolling thing pal.
dsm1lmf,Sprizzo11,I never said they troll the same way. Just said Embiid probably wants the reputation of being the basketball troll who gets in other players heads. Show me where I said they troll the same way.
dsm1t62,J-E-G-V-L,"""This is what Embiid wants to be"". I already told you my problem with your statement is and you said you didnt mean it literally. The rest of your original comment is imo wrong, but the rest of it is subjective. Its not subjective to say Embiid and Stephenson troll differently though, which they do. You already admitted to your fault why do you keep trying to make it seem like everyone agrees with you?Hint, thats a rhetorical question I know exactly why."
dsm1ut6,Sprizzo11,Sure. Just tell me why you were so offended about me assuming you were a sixers fan.
dsm21rw,J-E-G-V-L,I literally was never offended by that but I did feel the need to correct you. What are you not understanding?
dsm24e6,Sprizzo11,"You said ""I have no affiliation with them"" and ""I hate when people assume shit"". Doesn't it seem a little unreasonable to get mad at someone for assume you're a fan of a team when the flair says that you are a fan of that team?"
dsm294m,J-E-G-V-L,I hate when people assume shit in every context. That doesnt make me thin skinned. Thats like someone hating spiders. Why are you going around calling people trolls and dumbasses when they arent what you think they are is the real question here.
dsm2bs8,Sprizzo11,"So you're basically saying it was wrong of me to assume you're a sixers fan, even though that's your flair? Just say yes or no. Don't work around the question and then I'll see your side of the story."
dsm2enn,J-E-G-V-L,"Oh I completely understand why someone like you would go there, you saw I was a sixers flair and Embiid plays for the sixers. So you decided not did I speak for the whole sixers fanbase, but that I was also sensitive. Like saying a dark skinned guy robs stores, when in reality, that dark skinnes guy is indian, and black people dont rob any more stores then other races to begin with."
dsm2fzw,Sprizzo11,I called out 6ers fans before you responded. Usually if you have a sixers flair you are a sixers fan. Still worked around the question because you know you have no clue what you're talking about lol
dsm2jbq,J-E-G-V-L,What? Your whole reason for calling out sixers fans was literally because I responded. You literally replied to me with the sixers fans are defensive shit. And I answered your question. You are very wrong I thought I made that clear with my extreme analogy.
dsm2lbd,Sprizzo11,"Didn't clarify. When I meant respond I meant about the flair. I'll leave you alone if you just tell me why you think it's wrong to assume you're a 76ers fan. Give me a yes or no answer. If you don't want to and you just want to keep trolling, keep doing it. If you just answer yes or no I'll be done."
dsm2otj,J-E-G-V-L,What if I dont want this thing to end between us?
dsm2q71,Sprizzo11,Shit do whatever you want I don't care at this point. Just don't try to take offense to such small things from now on.
dsm2xuh,J-E-G-V-L,"Dont make assumptions and then call people trolls and dumbasses when your wrong. Admit to it next time, and were good."
dsm0upt,Sprizzo11,This guy is such a moron
dsm9d8r,badhed,"Lance had a double double ‚Äì 16 points, 11 rebounds, 4 assists... and played a little air guitar."
dslplaz,fireice1221,Gotta love lance
dslu8xu,Siddc3,Why are people mad at lance for this?
dsmj9oo,Hoops_Junkie2,This sub is r/Lebron
dsm3spu,j4k3b,If you can't enjoy a good Lance game you are dead inside and don't like NBA basketball.
dslxcmy,FapstoNat5s,The league is better when you have players like Lance
dslvtvv,NotAThrowaway192,Lol everyone so happy LeBron isn't doing well the past couple weeks.
dslw4fq,BallLikeRalphSamson,Sounds like damn jerry springer there
dsm2dke,kayofkayos,Didn't watch the game but what did Lance do wrong here? To me it just seems like BronBron lost his cool
dslq1g8,,[deleted]
dslqusr,Juicer41,2 points.
dslq4n3,calebkeith,This lost us the game tbh completely changed momentum
dslqxjk,ArchbishopBanana,So the one tech with 8 minutes left in the game caused all those bricked shots? Really now
dsls05k,DunnAndDusted,"That's generally what happens when teams lose momentum, they stop executing down the stretch and put up bad shots."
dsls2x6,ArchbishopBanana,"No, they already stopped executing when they blew that 22 point lead by the 3rd quarter. This tech didn't help the Cavs but its not what made them lose momentum"
dsls5xq,DunnAndDusted,"I was watching the game, they had given up a lot of the lead but were still in the drivers seat. This killed all their momentum and they played flat for the rest of the game."
dslsfir,ArchbishopBanana,I don't know if you could say they were in the drivers seat if they were beginning to trade the lead at that point
dslrdgx,calebkeith,I mean it clearly affected the momentum of the game. No reason to be a smart add about it.
dslr71i,kots144,"i mean regardless of what lance did, shoving him was a total mental lapse. refs always catch the retaliation. lebron fucked up."
dslp2og,,i love lance lmao
dslwm7p,conyeighwest,Lebron is so mentally soft sometimes
dslqwv2,mavdude410,"Jordan would never have let someone like Lance get to him like that. He would have dropped 50 to make a statement. LeBron can't be this uncomposed and not bring more urgency to crucial games like this and expect to be considered the GOAT. He didn't even score 30. That was an opportunity to come out strong and from the look of the box score, it seems LeBron was stuck in his usual ‚Äúunselfish‚Äù mindset of getting his teammates involved."
dsltqfa,hotrod13,Not sure if this is a copypasta or not. Just in case: https://youtu.be/PPd3Ar8tP3g?t=4m34s
dsm1vdj,LyeInYourEye,Crazy that they show the replay of reggie pushing jordan but don't show the play before where Jordan did the same thing.
dslufj0,mavdude410,"Man that was an actual fight. Reggie gave him a hard shove and was throwing hands. That's completely different. All Lance did was poke him and dare him to get mad, and LeBron bit."
dslv1zm,pfqq,"Didn't know they had fines for players coming off the bench back then.Regardless, good shit. I miss rivalries."
dslwvw7,blueberrypoptart,ball don't lie
dsmazrm,dpjw,Ehhhh lance is no Reggie though. LeBron should not let lance of all people get under his skin like this. Even more than this one of his teammates should have set a hard screen on lance and checked him.
dslvnsy,2112xanadu,"Yeah, Jordan was the little bitch that Lebron learned his shit from."
dsltqy7,RendHeaven,Lmao Lebron is such a bitch
dslokm4,Slayer_Of_Anubis,All hail Lance
dslz78v,dontheconqueror,BRON READY
dsm6tdp,krooloo,"It's hilarious cause he has this ""I ain't doing shit"" look while clearly doing shit."
dsm8oy9,AranciataExcess,Rodman used to do this to Jordan and Pippen back when he was in the Pistons. Daly drilled his guys to combine hard nosed defense with sheer mind games.Get in Mike's head and rattle his cage.
dsmf1gk,QuiGonJinnNJuice,Man I'm so sad Lance in Charlotte never worked... I want only good things for him
dsloq67,godlza,refs are weak as fuck for calling that tbh
dslv3v4,Superherosusan,"That's my issue. If you're going to let Lance be Lance, don't T up Lebron for giving him a little warning."
dsloi9k,untouchable765,LeSoft
dsltp11,bkmamba,Lebron is so tilted these days
dsloiy0,sahsan10,FUCK YES!
dsloi5z,little_legz,Lance is a fucking bitch
dsm1ll2,Heeeroh,Shut up you Cavs fanboy
dslqj7t,ModernPoultry,Lance has been a bitch since he was a Cinci Bearcat but hes grown on me. I just find his antics funny now. League is more entertaining with him in it
dslrjn3,I__Will,I love him when he's not playing for my team
dslscik,combat101,it's hilarious how much this sub loves him. imagine playing against a dude like this in pickup
dsltldy,8placeribbon,In that case he probably wouldn't be jamming his thumb into you when the ball is out of play because instead of a ref with a whistle it's an angry dude in the park punching you for it.
dslqqb9,DorisBurkeSucks,He's the fucking worst. Also pushed his girlfriend down the stairs but this sub tends to overlook that for whatever reason.
dslrcf5,panameboss,Not really defending him but it is worth pointing out that case was dismissed.
dslrhdg,DorisBurkeSucks,He also avoided jail time for groping a 17 year old girl.
dslwpte,woodelf,Wasn't he in high school though? I am also not trying to defend him cuz I still hate him for the staircase assault
dslwuuz,DorisBurkeSucks,"http://www.espn.com/highschool/rise/news/story?id=4321066 I think you're right. He took a plea deal for it. In reality he's a piece of shit, especially for the staircase incident, but I keep getting downvoted in this thread and others. Reddit tends to ignore a brutal assault if the guy has silly antics on the court I guess."
dslx0bx,woodelf,"No worries man I got you. Similarly I'm also not a fan of the rookie Josh Jackson, I don't get how easily people ignore these kinds of crimes"
dslx22x,DorisBurkeSucks,Thanks man. I guess people are very selective with what they get outraged about. In the other thread where I brought up the lance staircase story someone posted an article saying Lebron DM'ed a girl on Instagram and they thought that was worse than what lance did. I couldn't believe it.
dslxckq,woodelf,Wow yeah that's a ridiculous comparison
dslojc2,Dkahre429,WHAT YEAR IS THIS
dsltj47,40Vert,He finally got the result he wanted when he initially blew into LeBrons ear
dslvnl9,jumboponcho,That's a big ass ref
dsm4jrl,Schubes17,Anyone else see Cory Joseph do a quick head turn and almost square up on the ref at the end when he pushed him from behind? lol
dsmd67w,Mayhall_,"Lance Stephenson should be on the Warriors, LeBron stopper! üõë ‚úã"
dsmf39u,cementdranka,SHEEESH
dsmfg4s,Swainymcgee,I love lance
dsmw0t6,ozzyteebaby,Dammit Lance that man is a father
dsmw5v6,shockid1125,Who got the tech?
dsm1qhr,LyeInYourEye,"I know Cavs fans are probably pissed. Probably right so, but this shit is hilarious."
dslzg53,dontnobodyknow,It's been a rough 2018 for LeBron.
dslp7ed,agood1st_,"This is weak, should be a no call"
dsmhjk6,iamlugash,"lebron is just a baby, running to the refs crying to have things go his way.fuck the nba."
dslpdgq,Damn_Croissant,Lance Stephenson is a player whom I cannot respect. He's really just a heel with no redeeming qualities.
dsm0rgn,MilfMan2000,"Lebron bro, you a top 5 player of all timehow you get tilted by a journeyman who's 1 bad game from going to play in china?"
dslom8w,welchie98,"Lance is such a fucking punk, I can't stand it. He just fucking pinches Lebron, like wtf??"
dsloyfj,KamikazeMack,LeBron took the bait
dslp2ev,welchie98,"Lance is just fucking pinching his stomach and shit, thats mental. I feel for Lebron that shit would piss me the f**k off to."
dslp6o3,KamikazeMack,"Trust me it's the fucking worse, but Lance knew what he was doing. This is a situation y'all would need Dahntay for, maybe Shump is willing to go full goon on Lance"
dsm4bos,slurp78,He baited eemHe baited eemHe baited eemSee he holdin eem rightHe grabbin eemAnd He got eem.
dsmg5du,lowrynelsonrocks,LeBron just needs to go to the Lakers and be done with it...
dsm168i,RagnarThaRed,"I'll never understand why people find Stephenson funny, cool, or endearing, he just acts like a fucking clown."
dslx2vp,Voltron76,Dirty Player. Clown.
dslpygj,greatdentarthurdent,I cannot stand Stephenson
dslsi4c,Slobbin,"I get it. I understand what Lance is doing. He's beating LeBron the only way he can, by taking his mind out of the game. But this is some rec league shit. This is just being an asshole. It isn't clever, it isn't talking trash. It's just finding a way to get away with literally causing LeBron pain. What's LeBron supposed to do when Lance shoves his thumb into his stomach? I'm all for the mental game, getting into someone's head. But this is just fucking obnoxious. Stephenson seems so immature, it's crazy."
