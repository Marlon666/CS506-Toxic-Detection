dx7f86h,nocommentallowed,> AAis there an AA from behind for the penalty call?
dx7fn84,DaTripleJ95,Really want to see that ! There has to be!
dx7g1ke,CHOOCHOOLewRat,This is the one we need! Looks like Benatia's hands do grace Vasquez's back but from the front angle looks like he might not have pushed him
dx7flu4,Broka1979,"Wasn't shown on the bt sport feed. If they do manage to show it, I'll capture and post it."
dx7g742,Broka1979,"[Angle from behind, plus push by ~~Buffon~~ Douglas Costa](https://streamable.com/tqmh5) (bt sport)"
dx7h3a8,Butteschaumont,Ironically I think it's with the TV angle and at normal speed that the foul is the most obvious.
dx7h66j,jmontu1uc,"I don't know if it would change the game, but it doesn't seem clear to me that Buffon pushed him. Seems like Matuidi did it."
dx7hnsp,Broka1979,"Personally, I think it was a very soft sending off. Really could have given a yellow."
dx7izm7,Butteschaumont,We have no idea what he said to him. It probably wasn't very courteous.
dx7j94r,AchieveItAll,"Regardless of what he said to him, Buffon walked right through Michael Oliver and you **never** touch the ref. Not to mention being absolutely irate (of course it's going to be hard to control your emotions but still,) half an inch away from his face for a good 5 seconds. You'll be sent off every time."
dx7k0zz,lopsiness,Isn't Oliver the guy who sent off the United player for grabbing him after a call?
dx7ru2x,fonziGG,Yeah Di Maria against Arsenal in the FA Cup? Grabbed him from behind and Oliver's Face was priceless.https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5z9xm8/michael_oliver_gives_di_maria_two_yellows_within/?st=JFVRY46S&sh=66076cf1
dx7pxy8,Burgru,He sent Veratti off (second yellow) after he yelled in his face.
dx7rrbs,Sputniki,Or be given a yellow. It's not as black and white as you suggest
dx7yuxk,AchieveItAll,"No, it's 100% always red for touching the ref like Buffon did. I can assure you of that as I'm one myself. You don't touch the ref ever, unless were buddies and you're putting ~~my~~ (edit: your*) hand on my shoulder/back because we're talking about something, otherwise you'll be off. Sure there's sometimes discrepancies at the top level (EPL off the top) but at any National/Provincial level it'll never be a yellow."
dx7jmn6,Broka1979,"I agree with you, I don't think any one of us would be courteous in such a scenario. Anyway, if you watch the replay the ref shows the red card once costa gives him a sly push/dig (coming through buffon' left side), thinking it was buffon. So I doubt it was down to what was said, more the physical nature."
dx7xa68,wise_comment,If you don't watch out I'll annoy you into headbutting meOr so I surmised.
dx7ljcv,notathr0waway1,"If you think about it, the ref punished the team appropriately. About 5 different guys were practicallyjostling the ref. Making physical contact with a ref should be a straight red already, so they are already pushing their luck.He held his peace and instead of backing off, the Italians doubled their efforts to physically intimidate the ref, so the ref sent off the goalkeeper. He could have sent off 4 players, but he only had to send off one to make his point.Remarkable restraint and cleverness by the ref if you ask me."
dx7rvst,Sputniki,"> He could have sent off 4 playersNo he could not have. The referee is supposed to exercise discretion in every instance and if he had sent off four players for that he'd probably never have refereed a CL game again. Players crowding referees in controversial circumstances happens in several games every year. I have never seen, in 20 years of watching football, something like that resulting in 4 red cards. Certainly never in any of the top leagues or the CL. Even suggesting he could have done that is ridiculous."
dx85od6,notathr0waway1,I should have said he could have sent off any one of 4 players.
dx7otcy,Broka1979,"Sure, I can respect your point of view. As a neutral, I never had a vested interest in either team, apart from the entertainment factor. So for me, it was a shame seeing Buffon sent off in that regard. But as someone who lives in the UK I can assure you, Michael Oliver is far from being a clever ref, he is more about ego than anything else (""touch me and i'll sue"" attitude). Don't get me wrong, he might not be the worst from the prem, but he's definitely no Clattenburg."
dx7p3ko,notathr0waway1,"Ok, thanks for the background info."
dx8no96,blompblomp,"Touch the ref, you get sent off. There is no exceptions, kids are watching this and an example is being set. Buffon should know, from all his experience in the game, how often has a ref changed their mind on a call if you push him and get in his face?"
dx7xvjf,SirMothy,yes too bad he was being paid by Real Madrid to make shitty penalty calls
dx7sfny,chrismark4,"Fuck that, so sick of players surrounding the ref like idiots.This needs to happen more."
dx7uo0b,Broka1979,"But he wasn't given a red for surrounding the ref, it was because Douglas Costa shoves Michael Oliver. Ref thought it was Buffon, hence the red. A few years ago, the FA introduced the 'respect' initiative, where only the captains of either team are allowed to approach/speak to the ref, not sure if the Italian leagues have something similar."
dx7vry0,chrismark4,Buffon lost his cool too. And did nothing to make sure his players didn't touch the ref. If anything his reaction lead to the push and instigated the over reaction from his players. Fair red.
dx7h1zm,smala017,"THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! This basically proves it was the correct call.Is there any video of the Buffon red card live as it happened? Also, I hope Juve gets a lot of punishment for that. It wasn't just Buffon, the whole Juve team has him surrounded."
dx7honf,Pele20Alli,"Curious to know. If that's a penalty, then why wasn't Ronaldo's in the first half?"
dx8eyll,WorkHappens,"You can touch a player in the box, you can't shove him neither can you kick him in the ribs."
dx8i7bk,Pele20Alli,"Kick in the ""ribs"" happens after Vasquez starts falling, so that should not be a penalty just for that. As for the shove, what makes it any different from Benatias shove on Ronaldo earlier in the match, other than it was to his front instead of his back? Both are pushes and apparently should be considered penalties"
dx8l7n5,WorkHappens,"One you can't even see any impact on Ronaldo, because he simply put his hands on him, the other you can see Vasquez's head snap from the impact on his back. Also yes, contact from the back is not and should not be treated the same way in football. As for the kick it's irrelevant if he was falling."
dx8u8iu,NuggetsBuckets,">Kick in the ""ribs"" happens after Vasquez starts falling, so that should not be a penalty just for thatHas it been confirmed that the foul was for the shove and not the kick?"
dx8w5vj,Pele20Alli,Vasquez himself only mentions the shove so...
dx8wa4z,NuggetsBuckets,But only the referee's decision matters so...
dx8ymhu,Pele20Alli,"If a referee gives a foul for something the player who apparently got fouled didn't even feel, then it is obviously not a foul. That's the whole point of the argument about the call, and the inconsistency with the refereeing"
dx8zay7,NuggetsBuckets,">If a referee gives a foul for something the player who apparently got fouled didn't even feel, then it is obviously not a foul Yeah, that's not how it works dawg. Referee give fouls based on whether **he** thinks it's a foul, not whether what the player feels"
dx8zg6y,Pele20Alli,"And when the referee thinks there is a foul which never happened, then that is a wrong call. Just because the referee calls something does not mean it is the right call"
dx8zmzy,NuggetsBuckets,">And when the referee thinks there is a foul which never happened, then that is a wrong callBoth shoving and kicking are fouls by the laws of the game. He obviously saw either one (or both) of this was committed, hence why he calls for the foul.And now after we have views on every possible angle, there is definitely a)shoving b)kicking being committed. So he made the right call in retrospect?"
dx8zrul,Pele20Alli,"The kick was not a foul, and the ""shove"" is debatable, which brings it back to my original point: what is the difference between the Ronaldo shove in the first half and this one? Both were minimal contact, with the player dropping to the ground, yet one is considered a dive and the other a penalty"
dx9023z,NuggetsBuckets,">The kick was not a foul, and the ""shove"" is debatableOliver obviously thinks either one (or both) was a foul."
dx907ww,Pele20Alli,"And that is why it was a bad call. If he thinks something is a foul and it isn't, then it's the wrong decision"
dx90x6p,NuggetsBuckets,"Wait, why is it not a foul? You just said the shove was ""debatable"", in which he probably ""debates"" it as a foulAnd do you seriously think if you kick someone in the ribs and completely missed the ball anywhere else on the pitch, the referee is gonna go ""yup, that's fair play"". I mean, if you've at least gotten the ball you could've argue that you're playing the ball. Is there any possible scenario where you could use your foot to touch your opponent's upper body and doesn't play the ball at all that doesn't result in the foul anywhere else on the pitch?"
dx911j5,Pele20Alli,"Vasquez was falling before there was any contact with Benatias leg. There is a clear screenshot of this but I'm on mobile right now and can't access it. Therefore, the kick is never really part of the argument. It really comes down to whether or not the ""push"" is enough to be a penalty, and IMO it is too soft"
dx916pr,NuggetsBuckets,">Vasquez was falling before there was any contact with Benatias legYou cannot kick your opponent whether they're jumping 10ft in the air, standing, or lying on the ground. It doesn't matter where Vasquez was. If you kick him when the play is still ongoing, that's gonna be called.He may very well have thought the push wasn't a foul, which means the play is still on and the kick is what fouled him. Or he may have thought the push was a foul and the kick was committed after the play has stopped. Without him confirming himself, we will never know.For it to not be a foul, both the shove and kick need to be deem not a foul. The shove is arguable but the kick is definitely not."
dx91ayu,Pele20Alli,"It is only considered a foul if the player is actively playing the ball. Vasquez is not, since he is falling. A penalty cannot be given for something that happens after the player has gone down, but Benatia could get a yellow for that easily, so in that sense I agree"
dx91psb,NuggetsBuckets,">It is only considered a foul if the player is actively playing the ball.Not really, if that's the case then late tackles by that definition is not a foul, since the play has already moved to another part of the pitch when the foul is committed."
dx7guld,nocommentallowed,THANKS! you are a hero!
dx7gvun,matt-lang,"Ah it's a pretty soft penalty but I can see why he'd have to call it in that situation. On the fence about this one.Personally I would be upset if it was called in a regular game, but just given the importance of this game I think the refs didn't want to let anything slide at the end.Unfortunate way to end the game, though."
dx7n2jp,syn506,How is running into someone from behind in a clear goal scoring opportunity directly in the 6 yard box not a penalty? [Not to mention kicking him in the chest to get to the ball?](https://i.imgur.com/c2G8Y2u.jpg)
dx7nq4i,matt-lang,I am just saying that from the video it's questionable how much of a shove he actually gave him. Some contact is expected while making a challenge but he just pushed off too hard.
dx7nrqv,syn506,"If you think it's questionable from that angle, boy am I glad you aren't a ref."
dx7nujh,matt-lang,I never once argued it wasn't the correct call... you're arguing for no reason.
dx7ny4h,syn506,"Then why are you calling it ""questionable""?"
dx7pvsa,matt-lang,"Because it is... Challenges in front of the goal happen and lot and it wasn't a super obvious penalty at first because it didn't look like he put his weight into Lucas, and the kick would have just been a clean challenge apart from that. but from the replay it showed that it was as enough to warrant a penalty. So, in this situation it was the correct call to award a penalty. But in an earlier part of the game the push was just soft enough that it might have been ignored. So that's why I said it's questionable."
dx8ai3c,moopoint,Is there an AA from behind for the goal? Want to see how far away from saving it the keeper was.

dx7g0xd,epicfishboy,"“Clearly a dive” and “I think” make literally 0 sense when together. How can it be clear, if you're not sure? It was a penalty. Benatia has only himself to blame."
dx7hk87,slidinggoal,I meant that 4 me it's clearly a dive. Lucas is diving when he feels Benatias approaching. Benatia then try's to circle around him but he is already in the process of diving. I mentioned that it's a tough call too because of the velocity of the play. Have you thought about something being clear to you personally? Convinced about something. (Even though the ref said otherwise) That's what I meant.
dx8qg3l,Pippelitraktori,Lucas does not even see benatia and fall only after benatia jumps on his back. You're tripping. Watch the slow mo again

dx8d3ld,clantz8895,"Agree. I think benatia's leg wrapping around vasquez is another major factor there. Pretty much stops him from any fair chance to play the ball, whereas benatia has no clear opportunity to get the ball."

dx7kbbx,,[deleted]
dx7khmz,Xwarsama,"Maybe because it's a pretty common expression that is used to describe situations exactly like this? If you search Twitter for ""Ronaldo ice in his veins"" I'm sure you'll get hundreds of results from the last few hours."
dx7g7mt,thisisdropd,"For all the shit penaldo gets, this is why he's their designated taker. A less composed player might've overshot it and sent the ball into orbit."
dx7l8ol,Compendyum,Sergio Ramos agrees on this.
dx7s8dr,Mister_Sassafrazz,Sergio Ramos and Messi agree on it.
dx7fojh,AsnSensation,And he shot the penalty so well that even if the keeper knew where it was going it would be hard get lol. Ice cold killer
dx7g2p8,Razzler1973,Of course the pressure is on Ronaldo!
dx7g4pm,MayorofBERNington,"He looked really nervous I thought,not that it made a difference"
dx7fxvl,llblyndll,I don't think ronaldo is capable of feeling things tbh
dx8ehvo,dkny59,ronaldo thrives on pressure
dx7f0se,alwaysframe,opportunity of a lifetime though so I can't imagine how stressful it would be.
dx7fbep,mugurg,True that
dx7eqfn,nuqjatlh,especially with such a well taken penalty.
dx7q8mm,spectert,It was an unsaveable penalty too. It isn't like he went down the middle.
dx7g1ks,joe4553,Isn't it 3-1 at 90? Does it even matter?
dx7gjlw,luigitheplumber,This game's result is added to last week's. This goal was extremely significant.
dx7ldow,pedrohnj,"Madrid beat Juve 3-0 last week. If Ronaldo hadn't scored the penalty, then the game would've gone to OT and it really could have been anyone's game. Juve would be a man down, though"
dx7h3x1,M_night_chardonnay,"No doubt, although not sure what Craig noone has to do with all this"
dx7fy6u,obcdexter,"Save the penalty and you're responsible for your decimated team having to play 30 more minutes against Real, probably getting battered."
dx7ez2k,entun,North Korea flair and thinking he can ejaculate to Mars.. Great leader is that you?
dx8gy2c,joker_wcy,Obviously. Who else has internet access?
dx7fqim,kansasct,"I mean, a regular keeper doesn't really have pressure on penalties. The goal is kind of a given so it's kind of a win-win situation. if he doesn't get the pen no one is complaining and if he does he's a hero. Now imagine subbing in the last minute. It's even less demanding imo, though I do get your point."

dx7f3ma,fijozico,This is the best thing I've read all week.
dx7irxe,ACardAttack,"I really wish when penalties are awarded, the player who was fouled had to take it, would make the game much more interesting"
dx841ys,eyelikethings,The guy who caused the penalty has to save it would make it even more interesting.
dx878xd,hairypotr,Damn.Imagine Rooney taking down a pushed-forward Joe Hart in stoppage time.
dx8h5zu,joker_wcy,"This will create some very interesting situations, if the guy who caused the penalty is not a keeper, I assume they can use their hands to save it, then when does the privilege end?"
dx8ioar,KonturSvet10,Nah he has to stay in goal for the rest of the game
dx8ma4s,joker_wcy,"Phew, I thought he has to stay in goal for the rest of the life."
dx8b999,yamsinacan,"That would be terrible. I'm sorry, but I really have no interest in seeing defenders and the like getting fouled in the penalty box just because they suck at penalties."
dx8g33w,ACardAttack,"There are very rarely defenders in the box, plus the sample size will be so small it'll be hard to know who truly is terrible at it and that would still be one hell of a risk just calling someone in the Box because you think they are a terrible penalty kicker even if they aren't that great at penalties there's still a decent shot of them converting it. It is it far more interesting than letting the best penalty taker take it"
dxbdz9k,the_james_howlett,"that would be cool, and if the player got injured, then the team captain has to take the PK"
dx8exly,FRT5NY,lol like basketball
dx8s0b3,vox_veritas,"Then Mourinho starts employing Gregg Popovich's ""Hack-a-Shaq"" strategy on various teams."
dx8v9xm,ACardAttack,"They'd one have to be in the box, then they also risk getting yellows and/or reds and given how little scoring their is to basketball, that is a huge risk to take Plus with such a small sample size it's gonna be hard to really know who is awful at them"
dx7epc1,heyheyitsandre,Fuck r/all
dx7erzj,TheroPokemasd,This was not ideal for juve
dx7f9ny,faintedrook,"Dived the right way too, just a little bit higher and who can imagine what would've happened. Such a shame for Juve."

dx7eztb,HailHelix123,Dude forget the narrative that was an easy pen
dx7eibi,Prownzor,I'm done with football. What a shitty sport. The games are won outside the pitch (florentino bucks to UEFA). Such fucking bullshit
dx7ep70,gonnacrushit,clearly he paid Benatia to just demolish Lucas in the 92nd minute in the box
dx7es1d,Prownzor,Are you fucking blind? How was that demolishing ñ. That was soft as fuck. This is a contact sport you can't call that shit in a moment like that
dx7f6ys,MightBeDementia,Salty. He gambled and lost
dx7fc5j,prawntheman,He pushed Vasquez to the floor. Vasquez was between him and the ball. No way Benatia was stopping that shot without going through the player and that was what he did.
dx7freg,gonnacrushit,he stopped the attacker from scoring a sure goal by fouling him in the box. That is a penalty 10/10
dx7ftyx,Prownzor,For a Madrid fan it's a penalty. For anyone else it's soft as fuck
dx7rk15,JohnMcCainsArms,waaah waaah waaah
dx7eljq,come_on_mr_lahey,Knee jerk much?

dx7ere2,estoxzero,What?? You are a real Madrid fan boy...This is the help that receives real Madrid in champions
dx7f0fd,HailHelix123,Dude stop being stupid
dx7evcc,Dincht04,"Nope. Not even a Madrid fan. Just not blind. Terrible defending in the first instance to be so out of position, then clumsily pushed and wrapped his leg around a player about to score.Benatia was lucky not to be sent off as well, considering he got booked about 4 minutes before that."
dx7fg31,estoxzero,"It was a handball from the real Madrid player, you stop being stupid, it was a big hand from the ref"
dx7fiuo,Dincht04,Hahahaha. Sure. Take off the blinkers pal.
dx7fotr,estoxzero,"Stop sucking real Madrid's cock bro, it's already all white"
dx7fuwx,Dincht04,:-)
dx7gy4c,estoxzero,"To all the people who think it was a pen, go play with the dolls"
dx8s3oq,vox_veritas,"> go play with the dollsWhat is that supposed to mean? Is that an actual insult? Like, do people actually say that?"
dx8tclx,estoxzero,That football is not a sport for pussies
dx7rb0l,-Aerlevsedi-,Didnt Buffon get send off before the penalty? They still let him stay for the penalty?
dx84irv,eyelikethings,You can see the keeper isn't Buffon.
dx85rcx,-Aerlevsedi-,Ah... My bad
dx7e88n,HoldMyAwp,Keeper had no chance saving that
dx7el9w,-antifragile,Even the net had trouble mate
dx7f19i,BatteryPoweredFriend,"A proper smashed one, too. No nonsense run-up, already picked where he intended to put it, ignored the keeper."
dx7f9f4,Apotropaic_,"Didn't even try his feint, just fucking booted it through"
dx7ej17,NanookOTN,Nobody on the planet could have saved that one. Great pen.
dx7f1ss,HeungMinSwan,This man has nerves made of damn STEEL
dx7fg9z,desishaman,One of the most amazing traits about Ronaldo is he mental fortitude. To want to be the main man at the show and consistently deliver is great. And in these crunch moments just obliterating anyone in the way! wow
dx7g9l8,EtoshOE,He's the best at being clutch
dx7m1i0,cuginhamer,MOST DECISIVE
dx7nvqb,mycousinvinny99,Missed his penalty for us in the Champions League final in 2008.
dx7o8mz,EtoshOE,Being the best =/= Being perfect and absolutely flawlessOne could argue it helped him build the mindset necessary to be clutch
dx7v503,mycousinvinny99,"I bet it did help him build that mindset, luckily for him that mistake didn't cost him a trophy and he was able to learn from it without it being a horrible experience also!"
dx83hhp,naturally-wired,That was ten years ago bro
dx8a7ky,mycousinvinny99,Yes I am aware.
dx87ou6,Beatles-are-best,"We also wouldn't have even got to a penalty shootout had he not scored, and wouldn't have got to the final either without him in the other games. But yeah OK, you miss one penalty and dipshits like you still manage to watch a decade of a player who isn't out of place in an argument about the best ever and is the best champions league goalscorer of all time, and call him not ""clutch"" or ""handbrake"" whatever the yanks call it. He won us so much, and got us back on top of being league winners but also as the best team in Europe, and no he didn't do that alone as the team was stacked, but show some respect."
dx8rmlk,vox_veritas,"> and call him not ""clutch"" or ""handbrake"" whatever the yanks call it.Yes, if you head over to r/nba, you'll see discussions on whether Michael Jordan was the most handbrake player in NBA history."
dx8a7c0,mycousinvinny99,"Dude... chill.. first of all, I think he is in the argument for best ever (never said he wasn't), I never said he wasn't ""clutch"" or ""handbrake"" (nobody fucking calls it that in the US by the way, that was really dumb). And lastly he's one of my favorite players you idiot I made a single comment stating a fact in a thread about Ronaldo being the most clutch player. No need to be drawing your hilarious conclusions."
dx8eunv,alisj99,"I mean one missed ""clutch"" moment doesn't take away for how clutch he is. that being said, he also missed a penalty against Neur in the semis. he's still the most clutch I've seen."
dx7urk2,chanaandeler_bong,How bout his cross to tie the game against the US in basically the last second of the game? One mistake doesn't make him not clutch.
dx7v2xm,mycousinvinny99,"Yeah that was fantastic, I wasn't saying he wasn't clutch. Just don't think he's the best at being clutch. And before you say ""well who's better"" I have no idea, I just feel like you can't call him the best if he's missed a penalty kick in a champions league final."
dx88arr,mutheadman,Ronaldo is really clutch but he also has his moments where he chokes.
dx7p3de,khthon,He has a weakness. He needs to be hated and booed to feed his ego. It's the most Portuguese trait I can think of.
dx7uxsp,chanaandeler_bong,"That trait actually runs through many of the American GOATs (I'm not familiar enough to comment on international sports GOATs personalities). Tom Brady and Michael Jordan sought (and seek) out any slight and blew it up to insane proportions to keep the chip on their shoulders. It make sense. Once you've accomplished everything... What keeps you going? You have to create new enemies, no matter how small."
dx7h4mx,sgider,you're right but tbf he fucked it against austria in 2016
dx7i3ud,Marco2169,Then saved Portugal against Hungary to be fair to him.
dx7ie2z,sgider,"ronaldo taketh, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth, ronaldo giveth...."
dx7kdks,,[deleted]
dx7lagl,Monkeywithalazer,Unless he can take all 5 he didn't fuck anything up against Chile. His teammates couldn't take one decent kick. Nani decided to try to psyche out the 34 year old goalkeeper from Barcelona that just finished winning 2 copa America's on penalties by doing a slow run-up. Retarded
dx7lcrv,,[deleted]
dx7mqdd,jrodrigues,"Sure, when he was young and brash. But he learned. As captain gainst Poland he shot first."
dx7mv6c,,Exactly. That's what he should have done before.
dx7lg78,Marco2169,"2012, the tournament where he was top-scorer? He can't really be blamed for his team mates misses, and if so, he took the first one against Poland next time around. Plus he lost to the eventual champion, so he didnt ""fuck Portugal""."
dx7lg29,pedrohnj,"I'm not quite sure he chooses to be the last one. Maybe he does, but how can we possibly know?"
dx7j18e,renome,"Besides what the guy below said about Hungary, I'd just like to add that's part of his strength - nobody is perfect, but he truly doesn't look like he gives a shit even if he screws up, at least not in the sense that a mistake will affect his confidence even for a bit. The guy could miss five penalties in a row and I'd probably still want him to take the next one if he was on my team."
dx848lt,L7gendA,Couldn't have said it better. He is on another level.
dx7hwco,,[deleted]
dx8aipf,sbjohn12,"Dude if you fired a pen that well on an empty net you'd be doing the same thing, let alone to send your team to the UCL Semis"
dx7fft5,mugurg,He actually looked quite stressed but then pulled this. What a lad.
dx7jfsc,spiralism,"The way he can just take one breath and instantly, visibly snap into supreme focus is just incredible. His mental fortitude is out of this world."
dx7snje,scarytm,"I remember watching a video of a laser being shown into his eyes before a penalty and he starts to complain, then just snaps, takes a breath, instant focus and scores. crazy"
dx7wc48,AfridiRonaldo,"Yup, that was the penalty vs PSG"
dx7ysk2,Just_Here_4_Beer,Someone reply with a link
dx7zsy3,AfridiRonaldo,[Cool as a cucumber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xsdCCwFGaI)
dx80unk,Commandophile,forgot about how great this was. Like a meditative trance.
dx877b4,AlekhyaDas,also it was a penalty with a volley. The ball got up before he even touched his foot. Watch another video and check closely and you might see it.
dx92mir,diasfordays,"I don't understand. Do you mean that his plant foot caused the ball to ""pop"" up? Might have to go hunting for the video... but I'm at work lol."
dx887ed,Muddytertle,"Would of loved if after scoring he just stopped, pointed and mean mugged the douche with the laser"
dx8pcmo,MadridFC,you have a link on the one with the laser edit ?
dx8xuuy,AfridiRonaldo,"No, don't think I know what you're talking about"
dx99zpz,MadridFC,"My bad, I understood there was a video that laser tracked Cristiano vision showing where was he looking at and the focus of it."
dx7t7s4,horghe,And intestinal fortitude
dx8afeg,mugurg,Fully agreed. I wonder if he is getting professional mental support.
dx7g36m,aquadamn,When you have an entire team trying to mess with you like that it probably gets to you a bit lmao
dx7ghje,BrazilianRider,Yup. Whole Juve team was being cunts at that moment. Only reason /r/soccer doesn't care is cause it was against Madrid.
dx7m6o5,CarnivorousVegan,I mean the stakes sort of apologize cuntish behaviour!

dx839vy,xhen0,how isn't this a clear pen??
dx87yj3,TheGrandLeveler,"Lmao it's because he dived all the time and cried trying to force the call, stop watching football pls"
dx8vj8k,BrazilianRider,Literally nobody on this thread agrees with you. That should make you realize that your opinion on this is awful.
dx7nq45,Mr_Self__Destruct,Because it wasn't even a penalty lol
dx7onss,Alexkono,Time to self destruct
dx7rvc2,Mr_Self__Destruct,"I mean, there was contact sure but it was a very weak penalty to give."
dx7ugfm,chak100,"There are no weak or hard penalties, just penalties."
dx7z8cw,Mr_Self__Destruct,"When it benefits your team it's easy to say that lol. Still a very soft penalty nonetheless. Especially since contacts always happens inside the box, Vazquez just sold it well."
dx7zlc3,chak100,"Yeah, because Vazquez didn't even know Benatia was coming. It's a foul! I don't understand where this “soft pen” comes from"
dx855yj,bar_kerd,It's a pretty straight forward concept. Benatia barely touched him and Vazquez fell like a b*tch
dx89c39,chak100,"Sure, whatever makes feel good"
dx7xgqb,Alexkono,"Technically it was a penalty, but do agree that it was somewhat weak. I know if that penalty had been given to Juve, I'd be upset. But it was the correct call."
dx8ej8y,farzadviper,Wow somebody who is sensible.
dx7ri6h,RCubeLoL,he said in an interview after the game that he really was (there where 4 minutes between foul and penalty) and had to calm himself down. to shoot a rocket like this with that much pressure on yourself is amazing
dx7g3vh,xUsuSx,"5 mins of being pushed around and harassed waiting to take his pen. One breath, laser focus and it's all over. It's become a trope to call Ronaldo/Messi inhuman but seriously..."
dx7jyrw,Commandophile,"Messi and Cristiano are the product of the perfect dedicated athletes and insane attention to health/fitness. I think more strikers may come around to put up their numbers in time, but this sort of dominance won't be seen again in our lifetime. Two men have held an entire sport by the balls for a full decade now and it'd be hard to say that's coming to an end all that soon. It's spectacular. Every time one of these games happens now I thank fuck I get to see it live."
dx7pdtb,ultrachilled,"In my head, I like to compare the dominance of Messi and Ronaldo with the one of Federer and Nadal in tennis."
dx7rlwh,flatsixfan,"Agreed, but to be that dominant in a team sport is next level"
dx80tmg,Wertyui09070,Let's make a tennis court the size of a soccer field and see who comes out on top in a ten v ten season.
dx7flht,ybenjira,And he won't let nobody slap a tariff on them
dx7fhpq,XtremelyCluelessSoul,Nerves of steel is do or die. He misses they go into OT 11v10 against an old team. Great penalty kick regardless.
dx7gghw,TheMediumPanda,Just wish he wasn't such a demented narcisist. Can't stop himself from losing the shirt and doing all sorts of poses.
dx7hylu,Kylael,"I honestly think if I were him and after everything that went before the penalty, I would have tossed my underpants too."
dx7jfv3,glermz,I smell an ugly fatty over here.
dx7ie71,Synked,Did you see all the Juventus players trying to fuck with his head? It was the best way to give back to them
dx7ffea,Prownzor,Helps that he gets lots of practice with penalties

dx7jduk,Ed_G_ShitlordEsquire,There's a guy called Dave at United that I wouldn't put my money against.

dx8ft58,UhYah52,OPM
dx7i27a,RasenRendan,Maybe only Buffon ironically....
dx7j9d0,CharlotteRoche,Neuer would have
dx7fo4e,Jacosci,Szczesny forgot to press CTRL+S.
dx7fwcg,TonyBolognawithchees,What about that one cat that people thought was David de gea
dx7ftiu,chaRxoxo,But penaldo memes?
dx7evv5,B1GCl0,buffon could have saved that. too bad. still the greatest keeper ever imo
dx7ezcy,codespyder,Yeah he could have. If he wore a cape.
dx7f23h,MuriloVeratti,"I love Buffon, but no. No one could have saved. That was the perfect example of an indefensible shot."
dx7f20t,Immortal1s,"Supposing even if he gets to the ball, and his hand reaches it, the pace on it would 100% take it into the back of the net regardless. Unsaveable"
dx7f0w5,IASWABTBJ,"I don't think so. Sure if he stepped there before the shot many could've gotten it, but from a stand-still in the center I don't think anyone could've gotten that."
dx7gur5,pewdsIsTheGoat,Hmmm Iker Casillas maybe?
dx7f931,B1GCl0,"Damn, wasn't expecting to get down voted like this. i suppose we will never know, would like to know what he said to the ref tho."
dx7hljm,Apotropaic_,Bruh that is literally an impossible penalty to save unless the keeper was a giant
dx7fbon,Random_Acquaintance,Diego Alves would like a word with you.
dx7ejfw,joyful-,what a penalty from Ronaldo in such a situation
dx7ezs9,dahomie_longstroke,Had his shirt halfway off before ball even hit landed on ground lol
dx7gitz,stcwhirled,It's part of the script.
dx7mqzn,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,No it bounced off the floor before he even started
dx7f17j,W1llF,Reminds of that penalty in the PSG (?) game where someone was shining a green laser in his eyes and he suddenly just snapped to game mode and scored
dx7o0om,islingtown,"Yeah it was PSG and you're absolutely right, don't think there are many people that can switch from frustration to absolute focus so quickly.Looked it up quickly and found this for anyone who doesn't remember or would like to re-watch but it's not the best quality! https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6evz00"
dx7od5k,sebas8181,[Badass moment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xsdCCwFGaI)
dx7f5j1,tapped21,"He didn't even go down the middle, went for the top corner. Absolute nerves of steel."
dx81uxz,lkc159,He's probably also practiced that a million times at least
dx86qr6,comehonorphaze,Ive practiced walking in a straight line 100000 times. If you put all that pressure on me with the whole world watching I'm probably gonna fuck that up.
dx88yy7,lkc159,"He probably has good tunnel vision (i.e. the whole world isn't watching because to him, it's just him and the ball), and being able to snap out a shot like that with utter confidence that it's going to go in shows just how much he had to practice in order to get it right.I'm just saying that he's probably trained at not just kicking the ball into the top corner, but also practicing how to shut out everything else to the point that it's beyond whatever his nerves would like to say about the situation."
dx7f6cq,Lyonaire,I mean hes literally THE player you want in these situations.
dx7or4g,Alexkono,"They don't call him ""Penaldo"" for nothing ^/s"
dx7ifpz,StickyLemonJuice,take my upvote! he truely is
dx7oewz,itsclassified_,One of THE 2 players you want. MessiThat penalty was mental tho.. I didn't realize where he had aimed until the ball almost ripped the net
dx7p9eg,Styphelus,I wouldn't want Messi. He never shows up for big games but the team still hopes he will and still counts on him way too much.
dx7ruvy,IzkaGruba,i upvoted you for being right mate

dx7v1b2,itsclassified_,I think at that level Messi vs Ronaldo becomes a subjective discussion that only an idiot would criticize another persons opinion
dx7f04e,DeeneysCajones,He doesn't feel pressure
dx7f4i5,joyful-,"he probably does, and he fucking enjoys it"
dx7jz6e,flifthyawesome,It is kind of a rush. I kind of enjoyed studying last 8 hours before exam cause of the pressure. Same thing with bugs in production.
dx7r9dh,shriek,You are a mad man and I just realized I do too. Is this healthy?
dx85l1v,Akmuq,"Eh, beats getting stressed over things I guess."
dx7k1m8,Commandophile,"I'd say he is a masochist, but it's the people who anger him that get punished."
dx7j6r8,setfaeserstostun,Only when he's in the penalty area and a fullback is within 5 feet.
dx7fhrf,TheGreatSwissEmperor,Mental strength like no one else
dx7fm5d,MandaloreUnsullied,"Should've let Vasquez take it, selfish imo /s"

dx7eezr,CrazyJazzFan,Dread it. Run from it. Ronaldo goal still arrives.
dx7emtd,chefCur,"One of the best PK's I have ever seen, especially to do it in that moment"
dx7eyq2,johnsom3,"It's funny that people call him ""Penaldo"" as if it's a strike against him."

dx7pb7y,khthon,https://i.imgur.com/gSK978E.jpg
dx7h061,Tifoso89,Has he failed any?
dx7hk9e,SpaceCocoa,"UCL final, Man Utd. vs Chelsea is probably the most high profile one. But then John Terry the United legend made us win in the end anyway (Also Van der Sar :) )"
dx7jn13,Dob-is-Hella-Rad,"Back then there was a clear method for saving a Ronaldo penalty or forcing him to hit a bad one: just don't fall for the stutter. That's all Cech did and I'm pretty sure if it had cost you the CL everyone would talk about how predictable it was. Now, what can you do? He just hits it perfectly."
dx7ih40,BehelitOutlaw,John Terry is so good that even when he falls he tricks the keeper and hit the post. He's our legend and our captain for ever. You have no idea how much I miss him. He can slip all he wants
dx7obgd,ElliotAsbed,He's been a godsend for Villa.
dx7hwno,ShadowX22,"There was one earlier this season where the keeper blocked it, but then Ronaldo scored on the rebound."
dx7hbpl,Kingsodab0mb,He missed a few for Portugal. Against Austria EC 2016 to name one.
dx7mthg,Obi-Wan_Kannabis,"His record for Portugal is actually worse than Messi's for Barcelona, contrary to popular belief."
dx7j7bi,Dob-is-Hella-Rad,"It would be a strike against him compared to other players who scored the same number of goals if literally all he did was be this good at scoring penalties. The real reason why the ""penaldo"" argument is stupid is because he almost always plays a role in winning them. If not for the foul here Ronaldo just made a great assist for a shot that's probably as easy as a penalty.Hypothetically, if a player scored 60 goals on 60 penalties in a season, but they were all won by foulson solo runs into the box by a teammate, the 60 goals are cheapened. But Ronaldo doesn't do that, I'm confident that if you looked at every foul for a Ronaldo penalty he's either fouled, passes to someone who's quickly fouled or someone trying to pass to him is fouled at a much higher rate than most other penalty-takers."
dx7g3a5,desishaman,Who else would you unequivocal back in such a situation? Really only a handful of players that you would say no doubt it is a goal
dx7gc11,CrazyJazzFan,I remember once Lampard had to retake a penalty the times against City. He scored all three of the penalties!
dx7i4tb,-MCMIV,Peopla that say that have never played football. If you have played you know that it‘s difficult as fuck to score under pressure.
dx8403s,KriosDaNarwal,You can play football and still have that opinion
dx8t0cw,ClarkFable,And considering the fact he was the one to set up the pen with a perfect head pass.
dx7ou0u,midas22,"Yeah, he should be called PEDaldo instead."
dx7fg4m,,[deleted]
dx7g0fx,immoboi,i dont get why ronaldo gets hate from scoring tap ins. that requires good positioning and game sense to score those goals
dx7gbrc,kkultimate,The ones who hate him for scoring tap ins are the ones who havent kicked a ball in their life.
dx7gef6,immoboi,yeah exactly
dx7g1uj,0aniket0,"Lmao, you sound so salty. Keep them coming"
dx7g8i0,dohhhnut,oh fuck off lmao
dx7glek,anm63,It is a strike against him. Maybe you're not smart enough to grasp that the name comes as a result of constantly diving to get the penalties.
dx7h36m,johnsom3,"The context I usually see it in is because he scores so many penalties. It's in the same vein as criticising him for ""tap ins""."
dx7p3k9,LittlBastard,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuQjfm_CmOAHe's been doing it ever since. World Cup 2006, Quarter Finals against England. He was 21.You can call him Penaldo, Bikaldo, Divealdo... But he shows every year who is CRISTIANO RONALDO!"
dx7fsv9,VodkaHappens,"First comment I've seen about it, top bins."
dx7g3hc,joe4553,Brilliant

dx7erjm,Strikerrrr,swear to god r/soccer has the best comments
dx7f4kb,SirEliaas,you mean Penaldo?
dx7eref,9180365437518,Amazing penalty. He does not succumb to pressure.
dx7ej47,duncandoughnuts,Cristiano banged that home. Amazing strike.
dx7fkdo,Jeffy29,"So brutal, no mercy to Old Lady, how the hell he even can keep calm at such insane pressure?"
dx86ydd,comehonorphaze,"Something that stood out to me once was during the euros when Portugal had that penalty shootout there was one guy who was scared to take it. You can hear ronaldo tell him something along the lines of ""go up there and take a shot. If you miss you miss no big deal. We move on."" This mindset is what keeps him calm and its always stuck with me. Take your shot and if you miss you miss. You'll be okay."
dx7f3xe,BnWPanda,"Yeah, its smart move to write as keeper. Difficult name"
dx7odds,clwny,He had a better chance at getting a hand on the fukin sun
dx7f5ws,Apotropaic_,"Unreal penalty considering the situation, that should be in the dictionary"
dx814r9,not_old_redditor,"Talking about the pen, right? The original action right before the foul... Vazquez was never going to get control of that, look how far ahead of him it went after bouncing off his chest, Buffon had that. Full retard move by Benatia."
dx7eu43,ThatFrenchCray,HIDE DE GEA
dx7e8gl,maxhoobs,champions league is absolutely insane this year
dx7f8ks,Ned84,"This x1000This QF has been the most insane in recent memory and we thought nothing was going to top Barca's comeback against PSG last year. It almost happened this year, TWICE."
dx7gp8t,dntowns,*Almost*
dx7lm92,ILoveLamp9,the best kind of almost
dx7n8rt,tallardschranit,This x1000
dx7h7cz,mrsocool,So it happened once
dx7rmzi,ioyuri,"Yes that is the less informative way of describing what happened, thanks."

dx7rxxp,ioyuri,Sometime being concise sacrifices information. That is true. Thanks.
dx7s9xy,,[deleted]
dx7vbq9,Romo_is_GOAT,"This is a discussion of how insane the year has been. This tie, although not a comeback, was relevant to the conversation you robot"
dx7lphp,bonko86,BUT ALMOST TWICE
dx7xm4b,CETERIS_PARTYBUS,Which is at least *definitely once* but x1000
dx7lrml,Robinette-,If Real Madrid wouldn't have gotten the penalty and Man City would have won 4-0 it could have actually happened three times!
dx7rrcv,TomZanetti,If there were 10 teams in this round instead of 8 it could have actually happened four times!
dx88zxa,HenryHenderson,"If my pinball machine had testicles, it would be a hybrid man machine."
dx8b38w,ISCO-777,You my friend deserve the Ballon d'Or
dx7sydl,KokiriEmerald,"If we're being honest it happened zero times, Barca had to overcome 5 goals to come back."
dx7igef,Alekzinho,These KO rounds have been so exciting but I think Man City - Monaco last year was one of the most complete ties in awhile. Those games had everything.
dx7ot92,codeddavid,Maybe the gap in quality between the top teams and the super teams is now closing ?
dx7hc9c,1lifter,"I still can't believe, that people are praising that comeback, and the same people are saying that, pushing AND kicking a player in a box is not a faul. (The penalty was more about the kick, not the push.)"
dx7sheo,iceteka,I disagree. Imho the penalty was for the right hand push to the back more than the left kick.
dx7hpqn,pulse_pulse,"Well, to be fair, I think that Barca's comeback still tops this year's comeback plus almost another comeback"
dx7kh94,BoonOfIre,Barcelona were the favorites and had a lot of controversy in their comeback. I respect Roma's comeback a lot more.
dx82t3i,DrSly,Lmfaooo and bayern as slowly just sliding through the Champion's League DMs
dx8avkb,thesoccerone7,"I wouldnt consider them sliding through, Sevilla only needed one goal to move on"
dx8bc06,Aspeks,They needed two. Or am i missing something here?
dx8bspx,DrSly,Yeah they needed 2....
dx83k4e,Shakespeare257,"Why is nobody here commenting on the absurd penalty and the even more absurd red card for Buffon, who is the CAPTAIN of the team and thus has the right to address the referee????"
dx7i8fd,Bayerrc,"Umm, none of this tops barca's comeback last year. Even if they *had* both come back, neither would have been as good."
dx7h8bi,ThienHuuDo,De Gea is safe now boys. We'll be gucci next year.
dx7sy40,siponthedata,This is my first year watching soccer and I love this shit!!
dx7jo9w,abaram,"Yeah man, I got in trouble at the office for losing my shit after the red card for Buffon."
dx7fp0a,GiovaOfficial,"Yeah, the problem is that Real always find a way through, fair or not. Last year the ref, this year, well… a penalty, but at least it was a pen"
dx7gz04,maxelnot,What did the ref do last year?Don't remember
dx7h358,GiovaOfficial,"Not in the final, but I'm pretty sure Bayern remembers"
dx7h4ui,aquadamn,"The ref was bad on both sides, ignoring it doesn't make it false"
dx7h72d,GiovaOfficial,"That's true, but one mistake in Bayern's favour doesn't equal three or four in Real's. Everybody in the world saw it, come on"
dx7h90s,aquadamn,"One? An offside goal, a red card that wasn't shown in minute 6, a penalty on Casemiro not called from the top of my head"
dx7ww7y,UTP_98,bayern got straight up screwed by the referee last year
dx7hryu,CarlosFer2201,Bayern got 2 goals from the offside last year. The refs in that series did mistakes against both.
dx7gs0c,kokeiro,Lol you pathetic haters. Keep em coming
dx7gvxt,GiovaOfficial,"Tottenham played with honour and deserved to go through, you didn't. I think everyone saw that"

dx9g2bl,TheRealATab,"All good, good luck On the work"
dx859vg,bar_kerd,2 words. Match. Fixing.
dx7elpp,bruno1m2m3,"One of the most frustrating moments in the life of a Juventus fan, I'm sure."
dx7h1bg,droidonomy,Can confirm. It actually hurts more than the past two final losses because this time I actually feel like we deserved to win.
dx7iquu,nekkidfauno,Feel like Juve and Atleti have a lot in common here. I know this one definitely hurts more for you guys but goddamn am I pissed right now lol
dx7jerj,virginiadicky,Why deserve though? It's two games and Real was on the brink of scoring at the end. In no way did anyone deserve to win the matchup. Just someone had to make the first big mistake and it was Juve.
dx7u319,gregnicotera,Just imagine if Juve had their own Messi/Ronaldo player.
dx7u8tb,virginiadicky,"Dybala maybe, but I feel like if he was going to be as good as them he'd already be there. But it's possible."
dx7v7id,gregnicotera,Could be in the future! It sucks we didn't have him today due to 2 weak yellows last leg...
dx8ebgv,ChiefRedEye,"2 weak yellows? Nice whitewashing already. Totally deserved, obvious yellows for recklessness. Losing respect to Juventus for the lack of grace in defeat."
dx8gmtb,RSN_Marath,As a Real Madrid fan you can't possibly be serious...
dx95ldf,gregnicotera,Certainly the weakest set of yellows this year in CL. Madrid players just flop over and are used to getting calls. It happened again with Vasquez for the PK to end the tie; he flopped over with minimal contact. If I had these calls against me on the field I would be pissed too. BTW ask Zizou about grace on the field rofl...
dx8gzut,Arrown,Neymar would be perfect for Juve and Italian football tbf.
dx82udx,bo0mb0om,"Real had many more goal attempts than Juve.And the last penalty was a for a slam dunk goal that Ronaldo would have hit if not bumped from behind, so it is wrong to say “deserved”."
dx7x9lr,ShadowDandy,"I dont know, they almost comeback a 0-3? But i guess is normal to you"
dx7xokx,virginiadicky,And the other team beat them 3-0. Math bruh
dx9iil0,ShadowDandy,"Thats the point, rhey could play it with the 3rd team, it was an almost done match, but they didnt gave up and scored not 1 but 3 goals to Real Madrid, thats why they deserve to pass"
dx9koqs,virginiadicky,"But they needed to foul to keep Real from scoring the last goal, so by that logic Real deserved to win too. In reality the only team who ever deserves to win is the one that scores the most goals and doesn't commit as many fouls."
dxak2c3,ShadowDandy,"The foul is a mistake commited by a player (its the definition) so its not about deserving a foul, second why real madrid deserve it more than Juve? If it wasnt for the pk they would go to extra time **when they won the first leg 3-0!!**"
dxawi6l,virginiadicky,"Some fouls are mistakes, some are from being too aggressive. But I understand your point.Let me clarify: I don't think any team “deserves” to win. That's what I meant to say. You can park the bus the whole game and have 5% ball control, but if that team doesn't score and you score once on a counter attack that doesn't mean you didn't deserve to win. We must have a different concept of the idea of someone deserving something."
dx7k35d,__gc,"We played way better the first leg than real played this one. Indeed, the 3-0 did not reflect how the teams actually played. But that's football."
dx7o0dm,,[deleted]
dx7o4qb,__gc,"I said, and meant, we played better than real played this one. Besides, playing better doesn't entail you win. 101."
dx866lb,sunjx,Luck？Real hit the frame twice in the first leg and Ronaldo missed a wide open shot. It could be 4-0 or 5-0 maybe even 6-0 considering luck. Btw Real got a frame in the second leg too.
dx7omlg,Marem-Bzh,I think he meant we just lacked a little bit of luck in the first leg to be honest
dx7lnvt,Trance2000,"Come on dude.Real dominated this game and created way, way more scoring opportunities.The only reason the game was tied is because Navas made an unexpected bad error."
dx7lust,droidonomy,But that's assuming we wouldn't have pushed for a third goal if Matuidi hadn't scored the one he did. It's all moot now but it's not that simple.
dx7qdiv,seel_breath,"And Buffon made an unexpected error in the first leg, about 5 seconds before Ronaldo scored his bicycle kick, that's football at the top level, you keep putting pressure on top teams until one of them shows a chink in the armour"
dx7txp9,Trance2000,"That's the thing.I don't think Juventus put much pressure on Real today.They made them pay with good counter attacks and poor defending from Carvajal and the Navas error, but it was Madrid the completely controlled the possession and flow of the game. Especially in the second half."
dx7x3kl,seel_breath,"I agree about today, but only saw the second half. Let me elaborate, it's not only who can put the pressure on, it's also who can deal with the pressure, and Juve dealt with Real's pressure, just like Real dealt with Juve's in the 1st leg."
dx7mdq1,__gc,Juve dominated the first leg. Whatever dude.
dx7o9ij,Trance2000,Dominated into a 4-0 if Ronaldo didn't miss a sitter.
dx7obcc,__gc,Ok:)
dx8canq,Kopfballer,Over two games? Think Real was insane in Turin so 4:3 for Real seems to be ok Overall. And even without the penalty there still would have been OT and penalty shooting which is pretty much 50/50. But of course i can feel with you... if real scored 20 min earlier it wouldnt hurt so much probably.
dx7rkib,inno_func,"Well, you did win the game. Just not the tie."
dx8465g,k4deem,Lmao
dx7orwn,sebas8181,"Why? You lost 0-3 in your home, you never had the advantage in the whole series and even with the 3-0 at Bernabeu and in one of their worst matches in CL, they were pressuring and commanding the pace of the game for the last 30 minutes. RM could have scored twice for Isco and once for CR7+Bale each. In fact all your plays and specially the goals came from cheesing Carvajal's height (not that it's anything wrong with that, it's rather a mistake from Zizou and Varane) and a blatant Navas mistake."
dx7ovs2,droidonomy,"Okay.After that match I have neither the energy nor inclination to argue about a statement that began with ""I feel like""."
dx8dy43,steviebwoy,"Don't blame you at all mate. I was gutted for Juve, and also gutted that it was an English ref that was forced to make the call. Personally, I thought it was a very soft peno and was gutted that the fairytale didn't quite come true. In short, I was gutted!"
dx8e5fl,droidonomy,Thanks mate :)
dx7xuwu,Katlunazul,"Not really. If you look at the stadistics you will see that Madrid was superior in everything. 5 more shots at least. Several more corners, 68% possesion, etc..... They just were unlucky and did not manage to score."
dx7q3pv,maplekeener,"It was a penalty I'm sorry, he was clearly pushed from behind"
dx7st3y,blueorangenavy,lol you must've not watched last game or most of this one. You're lucky to even be in it till the 90th
dx7vld9,Messisgingerbeard,You did.
dx8ev4c,iannoyyou101,"97 penalty call, constantly matches are decided by refereeing and fouls, it's pissing me off"
dx873vf,HardlineZizekian,"Juventus definitely deserved to win. Vazquez felt 5 fingers on his back and just fell down. That's not how you win any Champions League game. I don't support either team but I am on Buffon's and Juves side, this is some ol bullshit."
dxbganw,the_james_howlett,"i feel bad it went down like that , as a madrid fan, i hate that they scored on us 3 times, . penalty in my opinion, only thing i have to say is that if you see the replay, never does vazquez look arond him or knew that behind him was the defender, he was just looking at the ball, so tha he just felt the hand in the back and dove doesnt quite make sense because it could have been a teammate there as well or someone just touching him and he would fall down? i think since the other dude is way bigger and was running towards him, he pushes him and makes him loose his balance, besides if the defender didnt do something, vazques just had to push the ball in"

dx7lnaz,KaladinStormShat,**we have exceeded expectations**fuck it. I'm cool with the results...
dx7lz20,AlphaQueueHard,"I‘m not shitting on you, it‘s just you clearly weren‘t favorites."
dx7m6oy,KaladinStormShat,"I absolutely agree, but Sevilla are a team that generally plays quite well, and has great talent. They compete against Barca, Atleti, and RM frequently and hold their own. They're not strangers to the UCL or Europa league. Yet somehow every time we play well against a decent team, it's either because the other team was playing badly or we were cheating. It certainly can't be that we have a solid squad and manager. Da fuq."

dx7gegb,Fredde1909,dortmund malaga but maybe I am biased
dx7ikot,Skest,Stupid daylight savings switch-over making them start at 4 am instead of 6 am here. Couldn't justify getting up that early on a work day.
dx7e8g7,existentialred,God. I felt the chills. Feel horrible for Juve.
dx7fk13,TedLassosArmy,"I feel so sad for Gigi. He deserved a better Champions League exit than that - but he lost his head with the penalty decision. You can't attack refs like that, even if you disagree with the call. Echoes of Zidane's exit."
dx7g6ou,clexecute,"It 1000% doesn't echo Zidane actually assaulting a player and leaving with time still left. Buffon got a red after the game was essentially over. Ronaldo scores 82% of his PKs, Maybe 10 years ago buffon would have made a difference, but honestly szczesny might be better at this point in their respective careers.Zidane was the best player on the field when he got his red."
dx7nlvj,ep1939,"> Maybe 10 years ago buffon would have made a difference, but honestly szczesny might be better at this point in their respective careers.You and I saw a very different Buffon today."
dx7ntxz,clexecute,"This has nothing to do with Buffon playing poorly, both keepers are playing well. Buffon in 2018 shows why he is still one of the best, but he has also showed some regression. Not in this game, but overall for the season."
dx8yhf0,KanyeWest_GayFish,"He's also never been a great PK saving keeper. The man's one of the greatest to play the position, but even he has faults."
dx91osj,vicdr97,I feel that only 3 keepers could made the save against Ronaldo and Buffon was one of them
dx99wkn,KanyeWest_GayFish,"I feel like that ball was as unsavable as it gets. Only way to do it is to guess right and dive early. Something he's never been that great at. Not saying he isn't the goat or anything, but pk's have always been something he's only average at"
dx7gphp,TedLassosArmy,"It's not exactly the same situation, and I agree Ronaldo probably would have scored anyway because he's so clinical - but it was still sad to see another long-time legend of the game go out of the Champions League in such circumstances instead of on a high. I really wanted you guys to win, but the correct calls were made."
dx7gzmp,clexecute,"He did go out on a high. He went out yelling at a ref for what he thought was a wrong call, the game was over, Buffons champions league career is over, I hold nothing against him for doing that. He didn't attack a player, he didn't attack the ref, he gave a slight push which is a red card. Then he walked off the pitch.Buffon's red was the right call, the PK could have gone either way. Not sure how benatia took a player out on a goal scoring opportunity from behind and wasn't shown a card. At first I assumed the red was for him honestly."
dx7hw16,TedLassosArmy,"Again, it wasn't going to make much difference anyway, but getting sent off isn't an ideal ending. Alas, that's football - it doesn't take anything away from his incredible achievements. Kudos on your levelheadedness after a pretty crazy ending. I'm a Spurs supporter and I was still firmly in the grips of despair after the match when you knocked us out. You played very well today, you should be proud.I think a yellow for Benatia + penalty was the correct decision - it falls under the laws of the game changes from last season. When a player commits an accidental foul in the box that leads to a denial of a goal scoring opportunity, then you give a yellow plus a penalty instead of sending him off. Benatia was making a play for the ball, so he gets a yellow instead of a red."
dx7r4tx,beastmaster11,Champions league now has the double jeopardy rule. Under the old rule (and still the rule almost everywhere) a team would be doubly punished for a foul like this (red card and almost certain goal). Starting this year (in champions) if it's a PK and clear scoring opportunity no red card. Same thing happened yesterday with Pique's tackle on Dzeko.
dx7rfhj,clexecute,"That's crazy, I didn't know that.Under these rules would something like Suarez jumping and batting the ball off the goalline no longer be a red card? Or is it only for double yellows?"
dx7uq7q,beastmaster11,"As others have said, it's only if the player makes a genuine attempt at getting the ball and failed. Ref would have discretion for that."
dx7rxh8,redreoicy,I imagine something that extreme would still be given a red card in addition to the penalty. At least I think referees still have enough discretion for that.
dx7slff,MarquesSCP,"I'm pretty sure if it's only a penalty when you try to go a ball challenge or something along those lines. If you deliberately handball, or just pull your opponent to stop him with no intention to play the ball you can still get red card + penalty"
dx7sukp,clexecute,"That makes sense, leave that choice to the refs, and would mean the ref made the correct call on benatia which is a little bittersweet because I like bitching about it."
dx7tcdi,MarquesSCP,I think this doesn't apply to second yellows. Benatia should have been sent off if he already had a yellow.
dx7vdtv,Semper_nemo13,"That was still the right thing for Suarez to do, they were going to lose if he doesn't clear it off the line"
dx7pxuf,MrCrushus,"> Buffon's red was the right call, the PK could have gone either way. Everything you've said about Buffon I agree with, but this statement couldn't be more wrong in my opinion. Honestly I don't know when the last time I saw a more blatant penalty.Push in the back, kicked in the body, Vazquez most likely scores if not for Benatia. Clear yellow + pen imo."
dx7q6cj,clexecute,"The way I viewed the call is, if it's a foul it's a red card, if it's not a card, it's not a foul.Goal scoring opportunity in the box, foul called. By rule that is at least a yellow card. If the ref didn't think it was a cardable offense there shouldn't have been a call."
dx7qkqa,MrCrushus,"I don't think that's how you should view fouls though. It definitely should have been a yellow, but just because the referee made a mistake in not giving a yellow, doesn't mean he made a mistake giving the pen.That was an incredibly blatant pen, Benatia lost his head."
dx930ku,TedLassosArmy,I think people are confused because it may have gotten lost amidst all of the late drama - Benatia definitely received a yellow card for the foul. Yellow card + penalty was the correct decision.
dx7qms5,therickymarquez,"Debatable, imo the defender would get to the ball even if he didn't foul and in that case the referee shouldn't give the red. Didn't he give a yellow though?"
dx7lr5i,pedrohnj,> Buffons champions league career is over is it over though? has he 100% confirmed he will retire? of course you as a juve fan know more than me but idk i just feel like hes gonna give it another go
dx7m90q,clexecute,"Yesterday he was quoted saying something like, ""as a kid if I thought my last day in the champions league would be in the bernbeau against RM I'd be okay with it""That's not an exact quote, but the context was this is his last year. You never know though, maybe missing the world cup will give him enough motivation for 1 more season."
dx7n1ma,pedrohnj,"yeah, I just saw the quote after my comment. I still think this is not his last season"
dx7zef0,fourmi,And it was the world cup final. Not a quarter in c1.
dx7rw8z,RCubeLoL,tTere was almost a 20% chance that the game wouldve gone into 30 minutes overtime with one man less on Juves side.Zidane got his red card at about 20 minutes into overtime so this was definitely comparable
dx7s5ne,clexecute,"Ronaldo's pen conversion is 82%. This game had an 18% chance to reach extra time. After we saw the pen I think it's fair to say there was a 100% chance the game was ending there. Buffon wasn't saving it, so it really ended up not mattering.The only way it would have been similiar would be if Ronaldo missed the frame, but he put that thing upper 90 at like 1000 miles per hour."
dx7gcxm,10b-5,"Zidane's red card was in the 110th minute. That's close enough to be comparable. Comparable doesn't need to mean identical. Though, Zidane's reaction was probably a bit more justifiable, you can't really blame either one of them for reacting how they did in the situation."
dx7ghox,clexecute,"How is it comparable at all? Buffon is only our #1 because of his legacy, he is our second best keeper week in week out. Whoever ended up between the sticks was gonna watch a rocket fly past them, unsavable pen.Do you really think Buffon in the game would have made a difference?"
dx7gqa1,10b-5,I think you are confusing the words comparable and identical. They're not synonyms.
dx7qr8j,Eloping_Llamas,Zidane and France were screwed. The refs all missed it and watched the screens in the stadium to see what he did. It was a disgrace what he did but an even bigger disgrace that the refs did what they did.
dx7qw6i,clexecute,"This is very true, he shouldn't have been red carded, and FIFA should have taken action after the game to discipline him.Buffon should have gotten the red when he got it."
dx7rpof,Crurple,Pretty fair to say if you full on head butt a guy in the chest you should get a red card.
dx7sxfp,Eloping_Llamas,"If the referee sees it. A referee has no right to use the scoreboard to review a play so what he did was wrong, especially on the worlds biggest stage."
dx7so3i,MarquesSCP,yea how is that even debatable? lol
dx7t1nb,Eloping_Llamas,"Because the referee missed it. They miss things and that's part of the game. You, as a referee, turn around and watch the scoreboard to make a decision like that is disgraceful. The referee and assistants all missed. No one said it wasn't worthy of a red card, but if you miss it then you don't get a chance to fix it in that manner."
dx7t9eq,MarquesSCP,oh rly? I was 12 when that happened so I don't really know all the details.The refs saw the headbutting in the giant screens?? I guess that's why they don't show stuff on them anymore
dx7yem5,steik,"Yep, that's exactly why. Though it's not just from that one incident, this has happened quite a few more times. I'm all for VAR but it needs to be procedure, if one thing is going to be judged by the ref looking at the screen by chance, then everything should be judged that way."
dx8m2mg,fuckthatshit_,The only person in the world with a chance at stopping that PK was 2014 Tim Krul.
dx7k2mr,neymarflick93,Notice how zidane immediately left without celebration when the game ended. I wondered if he sympathized with Buffon. Just a thought.
dx7kcdb,TedLassosArmy,"As a fan of the game, you have to. Everyone loves Gigi Buffon. I wouldn't be surprised if it was from pure shock as well - it was a pretty bananas ending. This is the most dramatic set of quarterfinals CL matches I can remember."
dx7j3ue,soccerplaya71,"Looks like he got bumped into the ref from behind, weak red"
dx7lm6d,GodiFiorenza,he deserve nothing. go look what he said in interview after the game : he said the ref has a trash can instead of an heart and he shouldnt have conceded penalty because rube played well.
dx7uc85,darkerside,I can understand why he lost control honestly. That call just put an absolutely insane level of pressure on Buffon and he cracked under it.
dx7uvtf,TedLassosArmy,"I do too - he'll probably feel pretty silly when he's calmed down and seen the video. He's human, he did a human thing. Honestly, the whole kerfuffle makes me realize how crazy it is to be a top level referee - whatever they're being paid, it probably isn't enough. It's an unbelievably stressful job, I'd crack instantly under the pressure."
dx7vfhz,Lemurians,That is just a silly comparison.
dx83olx,Shakespeare257,"?????Where did you see an attack? Did he touch the referee? Captains have the right to address the referee, and it is very unclear what reason there was for him to be sent off.Zidane HIT another player, even though he had good reason. Me and my friends were discussing that we would've probably knocked the referee out if we were Buffon in that situation - the absurdity of the penalty call notwithstanding, the red card was a crime against the sport."
dx7fh0q,staticviking,Terrible way for Buffon to go out
dx7ewun,Albertcore,It's horrible
dx7eyen,DIRTYDAN555,"Seriously, after Mexico lost in a last minute penalty against Netherlands last world cup I felt devastated. I wish ill on Netherlands ever since. I'm pretty happy they ain't going to the world cup along with Chile and USA."
dx7ekeh,THEPSILON,There is no God
dx7q2p2,Flovust,"dont follow soccer, how is this horrible for juve? didnt they win 3-1?"
dx7rkn4,8thling,"2 leg aggregate matchup. Juve were down 3-0 after first leg. Then they scored 3 here which would have forced extra time, but real got a last second goal. Ended 3-1 Juve, but 3-1 + 0-3 = 3-4, so Real won."
dx7tww1,Flovust,is that how it is for soccer? like previous games score matters?
dx7u3ug,8thling,"No, only certain games are done on aggregate. The Champions League and Europa League knockout stages are one example, and some countries have their own domestic cups (tournaments outside of the league) have aggregate rounds as well. I believe Spain does? But most games are just that game. Aggregate is done in knockouts to be fairer - each team gets to play half at home, and 180 minutes will create a less random result than 90."
dx7ydy6,Flovust,so why aggregates instead of like a best of 3/5 or something?Im sure its been like that for years but just curious why its like that.
dx7ytgw,8thling,"A series has three main problems - it's too long, it's variable in length, and it's an odd number of games. This sport is not baseball or basketball - a 5 game series would take over a month between domestic games and just how much more intensive a single game is as opposed to basketball or baseball. The variable length is bad for scheduling. And then you have the problem where you can't balance home and away - in a best of 5 series both teams could win every home game and then one of them goes home winner. Series are just impractical for a sport this intensive, with scheduling the way it is, and with no seeding. A best of three series could maybe work but that's adding potentially more matches to an already exhausting schedule and probably doesn't end up being any fairer as an aggregate game has goal differential mattering."
dx7z3yb,Flovust,"Oh are the different games played in different weeks? I thought they played game 1 like a few days ago.Makes sense. Thanks for explaining it to me my dude, much appreciate, cheers"
dx876e0,LordMouine,"Just see it this way it'll make me more sense: If you're meeting a girl, would you be more confident and comfortable if she' comes over to your place OR if you go to her place instead? You most likely would pick the former. Champions league are just like that, you play in your place (home city) where you certainly feel more comfortable and the crowd is on your side and then play at the opponent's hometown (her place) where you're more the “outsider” and then you need to come out on top on both games"
dx879s5,Flovust,well are her parents home?
dx87fy2,LordMouine,Would that stop you?
dx87kfn,Flovust,"If I score, I score"
dx87svb,LordMouine,Amen to that
dx875be,rfb420,lmao fuck juve
dx7ep2q,archjones,Fuck juveThey played disgusting
dx7ffek,kinginthenorthjon,WTF??they out played us at some point.You have to give them credit for what they done.They really bring the game to us.If it was against any other team i would want them win for what they shown today.
dx7fpw5,archjones,Out played us in what aspect? Just 2 headers because carvajhal is shorter then mandzukic and a ball that slipped out navas his hand?These are favors that fell in the hand of juve.Juve however made sure real didnt get any chances to create by obstruction.
dx7fx7e,kinginthenorthjon,They controlled the game for most of the time.He turned the game after 80th minute.
dx7ezbb,pussykicker,man cmon
dx7fbmk,archjones,Nah man.I dont appreciate those small ticks like you do
dx7et25,gonnabeagloriousday,Are you special?
dx7g49f,raziiiii,"Sorry guys, he's that little cousin u hate but have to be nice too at family gatherings. Don't bother w him"
dx7fa7n,archjones,Im fucking amazing bitch
dx7g3nf,FootyGawd,Found Kanye's account.
dx7f5bo,Brumworth,As opposed to Madrid diving the whole match and waving imaginary cards after every foul? Shut the fuck up
dx7ffxf,EveryoneDoTheKlopp,Ramos was even waving the imaginary card from the bench.
dx7fg7i,archjones,Oh boy.
dx7f2l0,ritamk,"The team in yellow was Juve actually, not Real"
dx7fflk,archjones,Good riddance
dx7f0hd,OakAndrea,Did you miss all the RM dives between minute 1 to 90?
dx7fcfl,archjones,Dives? Are you insaneYou get dives because juve kept tackling them went they had a shot at creating a chanceA la fucking 9 yellow carda for juve
dx7frpn,TomClancy5871,It's not like Madrid played amazingly
dx7fvfg,lore473,"They were great, I think they were lucky with some chances but they were composed and they were playing away against the defending champion. Only if you are delusional will you say they played disgusting.IMO they wouldn't be able to hold that score for much longer, but they were immense today."
dx7es25,hydrophallusREX,"Understandably. But then, it felt like Juve were pretty tired anyway, didn't look like they could score another."
dx7eyyd,RoberTekoZ,Juve had 2 subs available
dx7ebyv,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,Juventus players should know better than to surround and talk shit to Ronaldo in such a pressure situation...
dx7fc54,AngryWelshSheep,Don't know why they took so long. Surely just gave Ronaldo more time to compose himself
dx7fzav,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,"Can you just imagine the pressure? Knowing you have to score a PEN, last minute, to get your team through and avoid Extra Time, Juventus players surrounding you at the penalty spot, new keeper in, also giving a few words, the whole Bernabeu depending on you and he goes and smashes it in the top corner, not even a safe penalty into the side but top corner with speed and height.. He loves the pressure."
dx7hs55,sosolastreethehe,Someone should try to be supportive of him before a penalty one day to see if that fucks him up.
dx7m9ma,e36_maho,Omg I had to imagine that now I'm dying here lol
dx8c1rz,SanguisFluens,Now you understand why the Bernebeu boos him.
dx7gk97,AutomaticStop__,"Ronaldo has been in shootouts for the CL and scored the winning penalty, he has balls of steel"
dx7je1b,BehelitOutlaw,He played and scored in 11 consecutive CL games now. Beating his own record of 10 consecutive games. Now scoring his 16th goal. The best scorer in a champions league season is Ronaldo with 17 goals in 2013. He has at least 2 games to beat his own record now. Also he's 3th and 2nd best with 16 goals in 2015 and 16 right now. I really hope he breaks it and wins it. Something to remeber for many decades to come.
dx7o7v3,Marco-Green,my fucking god he is insane
dx7n5ng,d0m1n4t0r,Got chills just reading what you typed there. Just insane stats.
dx7jhqa,Bejezus,> 3th
dx7jzbm,BehelitOutlaw,4th

dx7mcwu,speartipnip,kinky
dx7yxt2,LusoAustralian,"Man was designed in a laboratory for Champions league games. Hopefully he does something for us this world cup, would join the exclusive club of people who've scored in 4 different editions too!"
dx7n7x5,Shill_Borten,"Yeah but he is a twatEdit - Downvote all you want, the man will still be a giant twat"
dx88swq,Devanshr7,Ok
dx8bkb3,stealthmodemf,I feel sorry for you . You have more salt than the dead sea
dx8bno1,Shill_Borten,"Nah, pointing out that the men is a twat is not salty. It is just observational. I feel sorry for you, not knowing basic concepts like this."
dx8br3t,stealthmodemf,I understand mate. After such shitty the last 2 days has been for you 😂 you have to make yourself feel better but hey who is to judge?
dx8buop,Shill_Borten,Not sure what the last two days had to do with anything. How does that affect Ronaldo being a twat?
dx8bvdz,stealthmodemf,You clearly know what effect it had so just stop pretending.
dx8bx91,Shill_Borten,He has been a twat for more than two days mate. You seem to be salty about it.
dx8c1z7,stealthmodemf,Why will i be salty ? He is a epic player on the pitch which is why i am fan of. I wont have been a fan if he starts botling pens and faking retirement unlike some gentleman out there.
dx8c4dx,Shill_Borten,He is an epic player. One of the best ever in fact.Still a giant twat though. Not sure why you think being a good player has anything to do with being a twat.
dx7m5cu,just_a_poe_boy,"Well he did miss the one against Chelsea, also in a final"
dx7mhwp,AutomaticStop__,"He's also been in like 4 other CL finals since then, being then"
dx8gj7x,Comessuer,He missed in his penalty in our final against Chelsea. Was a shit pen as well
dx7jza4,Jerry13888,He also missed one in the CL final
dx7g9vj,prodigalkal7,"It's actually pretty amazing, I must say. Not many players could do that, or people in his position, could do that. He makes it so that there's no way it's saveable, but also with so much going wrong, but he still pulled away with it.All events aside, great penalty"
dx7hqt7,1lifter,"You can look at 2016 penalty shootout of UCL. Almost all RM players are shaking and shitting themselves, then Ronaldo calmly walks towards the spot."
dx7ifpg,dr_sust,Ice in his viens
dx7mtoj,s0ngsforthedeaf,Being the best gives you confidence.Or ratherHis confidence is part of what makes him the best
dx85nwe,dr_sust,"nah mate, i'm pretty sure it's the ice that makes the diffrence"
dx7kot9,Commandophile,great pressure can crumble stones to dust. it can also make diamonds
dx8aexc,Radslide,"Yeah, Cristiano and especially Lucas won us that shootout. There was this story about how calm and collected Lucas was when he went to take the first penalty, and that calmed every one else down. IIRC he also volunteered to take the first penalty."
dx7pnr1,NeonPatrick,He missed in the champs final for Man Utd though.
dx7hkrx,LongjumpingThroat,If there was one person i would pick for that moment it would be Ronaldo to be fair
dx7jaom,spiralism,"As he's said before: ""your love makes me strong, your hate makes me unstoppable""Those Juve lads chatting shite to him is what ensured he'd hammer that into the top corner. The man is an assassin"
dx7h48f,daxl70,"I had to fucking step away from the TV, cant believe how he just remains calm like that."
dx7hd7t,skapuntz,How many penalties in situations like this has he already scored? It's nothing new to him...
dx7mbw9,e36_maho,"How many have I watched? More than he shot I'm sure. But still, couldn't look at the TV.."
dx7if95,DaFrenchBastard,"Had he missed it Real would have still been alive in the tie. And they would have played 30 minutes of extra time against 10 exhausted Juventus players...It wasn't a ""score or go home"" situation."
dx7iw6v,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,"Hence I wrote ""avoid Extra Time""."
dx7m65m,AutomaticStop__,No OT tonight
dx7jci1,DaFrenchBastard,Indeed but I think Real would have cruised in extra time just like they did last year against Bayern. Pressure wasn't maximal.
dx7g8de,coopsquared,"Everybody and their mother knew he was scoring that come on, game was decided when the pen was called."
dx7h3qi,Fortrick,"still i think if not scored real madrid had the lead in the extra time, i mean, they were down to 10 players and had to sub a ST for a GK"
dx7nqbz,ep1939,"> the whole Bernabeu depending on youBernabeu was shit tonight, deserved nothing.Ronaldo triet to incite RM fans twice but they would just not chant, cheer or support the players a bit.RM fans truly feel like the most spoiled and less supportive I've ever seen in such a moment of difficulty for the team. Just silently watching the game. Generally players do not deserve with their attitude and performance the fans they have, today it felt the opposite."
dx7nw5r,BastillianFig,I mean even if he missed there would be extra time and they could still win
dx7iga2,,I mean he is one of the most hated players in football. He knows pressure.
dx8cok6,Golden_Draco,He's Infamous
dx7tzcr,wocaole,he is the craziest man in the fukin world!
dx7vvkx,Messisgingerbeard,"Ronaldo kicks penalties. Just had to do what he does, really."
dx8jixm,dannyboydingo,"I'm some bum on lunch break, but that type of pressure is the good pressure. He knows it, he revels in it. The worst type is sudden death of a penalty shoot where you know what is on the line. Miss - gameover."
dx7kp1d,SeanPaytonEatsWorms,"To be honest, it's not the most pressure especially for someone that's been taking penalties for well over a decade. Worst case he doesn't score and they're still going to play up a man against Juve without Buffon for 30 minutes. Real pressure would be if he had to score or else they went out."
dx7p6ya,sebas8181,Wasn't it because Szczęsny's sub?
dx7pm31,AngryWelshSheep,"There was 5 minutes in-between the foul and the penalty being taken. Bearing in mind you don't need to warm up a keeper a sub shouldn't take any longer than a minute, even with Buffon losing his rag."
dx7q3c8,blurr90,Delaying a penalty is in favor of the defending team. You want to give the PK taker as much time as possible. He can't do anything but his thoughts are running wild and pressure is building up. This is the reason why Juve did everything to delay it as much as possible.Best thing for a PK taker is a quick penalty.
dx7qhcj,AngryWelshSheep,"You'd think that but not according to most experts.https://blog.innerdrive.co.uk/the-psychology-of-perfect-penalties>don't rush to take your penalty. Take a bit of time to ready yourself. Footballer's who take less than 200 milliseconds to respond to the referee blowing his whistle, only score around 57% of the time. To give this some context, that is half the time it takes to blink. Players who take a bit of time to ready themselves, be it only for one second, score on average over 80% of the time."
dx8gtps,blurr90,That doesn't apply. Those numbers are only describing the time from when the referee allows the player to shoot. They say nothing about the time between the initial foul call to the execution of the pen.
dx7ft6d,,[deleted]
dx7g120,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,"I don't know mate, i feel as if he thrives of such situations."
dx7gk1u,Force_Kush,Teams have to switch it up and start complimenting him.
dx7fxep,,[deleted]
dx7g67s,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,Huh? What you been smoking mate? > he's not the guy who can make the difference on his own but then you say > I think he can lead real madrid to another title
dx7gbti,Android1618033988,"By finishing everybody else's actions. I don't hate the guy, hell I used to love him when he played for man U, but one has to look at how he's been playing for the last few years, and you can see that he's become a very good finisher but not the winger he used to be."
dx7glha,aquadamn,"How can you say this after this series, the final pen came from his perfect pass to Vazquez, he set him up just by an exposed goal"
dx7n0x5,Abracajayvee,This is just pure hate.
dx7gpa9,UBROKEMYFRIDGE,"Wouldn't you say that's more intelligent of him? He is older and saves energy, he doesn't need to play on the wing anymore and adapted his game yet continues to perform and delivers. >By finishing everybody else's actions. But Jordan did the same, he is finishing the action of someone who passed him the ball."
dx7geaf,lore473,"Sure anybody can score a bicycle kick, but not against Juventus away. I agree they should start thinking about a replacement, but he is far from done.And saying he doesn't carry a team is just plain wrong."
dx7ghgg,Android1618033988,I never said he was done.
dx7gntx,lore473,"Didn't mean to put words in your mouth, I was just stating he wasn't done, but I wrote it badly."
dx7e8nk,ImWaaal,sad it had to end this way
dx7ekp1,NanookOTN,"Sad way to end a game, but it looked a pen to me. Took some brass balls from Oliver to call that."
dx7f1uu,Ozils_eyes,i personally thought it looked very soft it looked like he was already on the way down before contact.... but benatia went in too hard and would be a free-kick anywhere else on the field
dx7fpp2,alexfrompanama,"Yeah I thought that too. But the alternate angle from the bird eye camera shows hoe Benatia comes at full sprint and crashes with an almost standing Vazquez from behind.Edit: meant ""how"" but will leave this typo for posterity.Edit 2: [Here](https://twitter.com/RodrigoGiacomet/status/984171280718028801) is the bird eye camera angle \(sorry, could only find it on Twitter\)."
dx7h1pg,TedLassosArmy,"Yeah, this. The angle from the front makes it look soft and I was skeptical, but that one angle shows how hard Benatia hits him from behind. Credit to Michael Oliver."
dx7hztg,yaniz,Do you have a link to that angle?I would appreciate it a lot.
dx7izqm,TedLassosArmy,"Someone else posted it in the thread, but [here](https://streamable.com/biz84) is a full breakdown from BT. I think the first angle shows how much momentum Benatia had in his challenge and the birds-eye one later on shows the view that Oliver had."
dx7l0gr,rodinj,Deleted :(
dx7l55b,TedLassosArmy,"Eek. Sorry dude. If I find another one, I'll send it your way."
dx7l98y,rodinj,Thanks!
dx7iqt5,Ozils_eyes,Might not be able to post here was benatia hits pretty hard from the back
dx7ytt9,LusoAustralian,Its because Vazquez falls softly. But Benatia has completely lost his man is has to try and go through him from behind in the 6 yard box. The only way a defender can do that and not commit foul is to completely cleanly and only contact the ball. Benatia is clumsy and panicing and does enough to warrant a foul.
dx82asz,smala017,"It's because he's in excellent position to see it. He has the perfect angle, perpendicular to the players so he can see exactly how much contact there is and exactly how hard Benatia hits him. He probably has a better view than any of the camera we have, even."
dx7hqi1,saberb13,That fuckin hoe smh
dx828zs,smala017,"Yeah, honestly for me the live broadcast angle is the most telling. You can see the contact and how it jolts the attacker's upper back forward. It looked soft from some angles but there's definitely a push there; I think PK is the right call."
dx7ijz3,the_aamir,The initial reaction of anyone apart from a Juve fan would be - penalty. Doesn't matter which angle you look at it after the game. Unless VAR or some stuff is not adapted properly can't really say anything. But anyone would've agreed that that was a penalty.
dx7khfo,Kitronx,VAMOS PAL MUNDIAL CHU***!
dx7l3a0,alexfrompanama,COJE TU MUNDIALLLL! 😄
dx7rufk,fmusio100,Have a link for that? Have only seen it from POV
dx7uhe1,alexfrompanama,Just now found the video. Edited my comment with the link.
dx8ao85,Kryptoduck,"That's no fault lol, basic physics. Penaldo at its finest"
dx86mdd,Lord-Filip,It still looks soft to me. With Vasquez reputation he let's himself go down.
dx81ja9,DellMB,It's a soft hand touch that makes Vazquez dive first and then contact with Benatias leg that otherwise would have found the ball.Angle is too far Benatia actually slowed down with his last steps.
dx81md1,alexfrompanama,It's a man running at full sprint shoving his thigh at another player's back then kicking him in the chest. Not a dive in my book.
dx82ptp,DellMB,No he is nott running at full sprint he also slowed down couple steps before hand touching Vazquez in the back which leads to Vazquez diving lowering his body closer to the ground and contacting his leg.
dx88g2l,skunkrider,"Are you kidding me?The bird eye view makes it look even more like a soft and really wrong decision.For one you cannot see the slightest body contact, and how in the hell does the attacker go down forwards if the defender's leg hits him from the front?There's a reason there's no VAR in CL yet, it's called the betting mafia."
dx7fso9,Jamesthefifth,"First he pushes him in the back with his right hand (see how Vasquez head tilts just before contact in the replays), then he puts his foot around and hits him in the chest-area without ever touching the ball (which bumps off Vasquez´s chest). On which planet is this a soft penalty? The only reason people says this is soft, is because of the circumstances. People would love Real to blow a 3-0 lead and go out of the quarter final. This penalty was clear as day, and Oliver did a excellent job."
dx7i8sr,smokingyuppie,"Yea, you hit the nail on the head. People would rather Madrid lose than admit it was a clear pen."
dx7gi8d,CaptainJingles,"Not seeing how this could be a flop. Both players are tired after 92 minutes, Vasquez has his back to Benetia when contact is made. He might have gone down easier because he is tired and didn't expect contact."
dx7gxxc,CrAppyF33ling,"He also seemed like he was going to shield the ball and quickly hit it. That ball was too low for a header, too high for a volley from that distance."
dx7iomv,INM8_2,"sometimes i wonder how many people here even play casually because anything off the ground is difficult to judge, even for professionals. just look at how hard it is for keepers to even get a touch to headers aimed downwards and they get the benefit of hands. vasquez is watching the ball the entire way and squaring up to either shoot or control it when he gets hit."
dx7kc9m,baysfadays,"They don't, in the sub survey there was a huge % of people who not only don't play casually, but never play at all."
dx7ozao,sebas8181,Pretty sure a vast amount of redditors have barely played any football outside FIFA/PES.
dx7tbhv,Ante_Up_LFC,Look at Keylor Navas's attempt on the 3rd goal for example lol
dx7uxo4,TrippyMane,Honestly I promise you at a pretty good level probably like 25 percent of this whole sub
dx8ezdu,fantalemon,"I would imagine it's far less. I reckon less than 25% play at all, and maybe .1% at what you would actually consider a decent level."
dx7ill0,TonyzTone,"""Going down easier"" also isn't against the rule. If you're fouled, but can stay on your feet you might be given advantage or the ref might just want to ""keep the pace of play."" Diving means going down when there's not fucking foul."
dx7v9nm,mellvins059,Not disagreeing with you but Vasquez came off the bench so he's not tired after 92 minutes.
dx7ip3h,labradorflip,"vazquez 1) came on at half-time and 2) clearly dived, there was minimal contact and certainly no foul"
dx7j6tz,CaptainJingles,"1) Okay fine, 47 minutes. 2) If that was a dive, it was the most phenomenal dive. He got two hands to his back, had no idea that Benetia was coming, and then got a knee in the numbers, and a leg over the top. Not really minimal contact. Dumb play by Benetia, but 100% a pen."
dx7jubm,cat_in_your_kung_pao,why dive when a shot from there is an almost assured goal?
dx7k3hk,e36_maho,I wouldn't say certainly. This is not a poor decision. It's really close and even with the slowmo and different angles we can't come to a certain conclusion. I think it's ok to give the pen as it would be ok to not give it.
dx7higo,roflmaodub,(which bumps off Vasquez´s chest).face even https://gyazo.com/a381d32542d2dce12b98ccb6a8043975
dx7hshc,Jamesthefifth,"From the slow-mo clips I have seen (admittedly not the best quality) - I believe the screenshot you have there is after the initial contact of the ball. I think the ball hits him high on the chest and goes a bit up, which is when this screenshot is taken. Not that it matters, Benatia never touches the ball and the penalty is clear."
dx7oxhn,sebas8181,"Not really, the only time when the ball changes speed/direction is when it touched Vazquez upper chest/face."
dx7q7xs,the_cunt_muncher,Seriously! The defender ran through his back. On what planet is that not a clear penalty?
dx7xhge,SirMothy,I have seen a lot more contact not called. IMO this shouldn't be a penalty
dx7lacs,Bisark,He touched the ball
dx7k4ry,MeeDurrr,Check out @alphabayern's Tweet: https://twitter.com/alphabayern/status/984181542200205312?s=09
dx88gsf,Jamesthefifth,"If you check some of the reply's to that tweet you'll see how much that still picture is lying. The ball came of Vascuez, not Benatia's boot."
dx7hst4,ColonelSwede,"Lmao, are we watching the same replays? Benatia doesn't run into Vasquez, Vasquez backs into Benatia to make contact so he can fall down. He isn't even interested in putting the ball in the net here, you don't shield a ball one meter from a goalkeeper unless you're hoping that someone touches you. Putting your leg around people isn't a forbidden play either, defenders do it all the time. It's definitely a pen but it's also entirely fair to call it soft, and had it happened anywhere else on the field there wouldn't even be a whistle."
dx7hzkv,INM8_2,>Vasquez backs into Benatia to make contact so he can fall down.vasquez has the right to occupy the space and do whatever he wants with the ball as long as it's legal and in play. benatia's job is to either take a better position to prevent him from being alone right in front of goal or to maneuver around him to get to the ball without fouling.>had it happened anywhere else on the field there wouldn't even be a whistle.lol no.
dx7iki3,ColonelSwede,"> vasquez has the right to occupy the space and do whatever he wants with the ball as long as it's legal and in play.Yes, he does, and he decides to dive, which just happens to be not legal. >benatia's job is to either take a better position to prevent him from being alone right in front of goal or to maneuver around him to get to the ball without fouling.And Benatia can't manouver without giving an impression of a foul if people fall over after soft breeze. Newsflash, that's why diving is forbidden, because it's an attempt to mislead the referee. >lol no.Lol yes. There's barely any real contact between the two, there's nothing malicious about it, nothing violent about it, and Vasquez wasn't prevented from doing anything, because he was not trying to do anything other than to fall. Open play outside of the box this is barely a free kick."
dx7jbai,INM8_2,">Yes, he does, and he decides to dive, which just happens to be not legal.i'm not sure where you're seeing a dive. vasquez gets to the space, watches the header, has his eyes on the ball on its upward bounce, then gets run into from behind.>And Benatia can't manouver without giving an impression of a foul if people fall over after soft breeze. Newsflash, that's why diving is forbidden, because it's an attempt to mislead the referee.and that's benatia's own fault for allowing vasquez to make a run and giving up the space behind him. if a defender is beaten to the space in the box, he has 3 choices: pray that the attacking player doesn't get the shot off, try to reach the ball without giving up the foul, or give up the penalty and hope for the best. benatia chose option 2 and failed miserably at it.>there's nothing malicious about it, nothing violent about iti was unaware that those factored into foul calls.>Vasquez wasn't prevented from doing anything, because he was not trying to do anything other than to fall.he was prevented from even being able to get a first touch without being run into from behind.do as many mental gymnastics as you want. you're clearly delusional."
dx7kkeg,ColonelSwede,"> vasquez gets to the space, watches the header, has his eyes on the ball on its upward bounce, then gets run into from behind.Vasquez gets to space, watches the ball, ignores opportunity to take a header while 1vs1 with Buffon, then he backs into incoming Benatia and dives after feeling contact. > and that's benatia's own fault for allowing vasquez to make a run Benatia is not at fault for anything in this entire bit of play.>i was unaware that those factored into foul calls.Yes, we've already established that you're not aware of a lot of thigns. >if a defender is beaten to the space in the box, he has 3 choices: pray that the attacking player doesn't get the shot off, try to reach the ball without giving up the foul, or give up the penalty and hope for the best. Striker who gets space in the box has 2 options. Pass. Shoot. Or if he is Vasquez, he can just dive, robbing defenders of their options of counterplay, which is why diving is illegal. >he was prevented from even being able to get a first touch without being run into from behind.First time I see a player trying to get a first touch by backing away from the ball and into opposing defenders. But whatever idiocy you need to conjure out of your ass to convince yourself that Vasquez was violently brutalized by a contact that wouldn't wake up my nan."
dx7licz,INM8_2,">Vasquez gets to space, watches the ball, ignores opportunity to take a header while 1vs1 with Buffonhe doesn't have to make an attempt on goal at the first chance unless i missed the new rule that says a player is obligated to take the very first chance to put his foot/head on the ball and isn't allowed to find a good shot for himself.>then he backs into incoming Benatia and dives after feeling contact. if by ""backs into"" you mean ""doesn't attack the ball"" then sure. by your analysis, he got to the spot, declined to shoot, and was contacted by a running defender that was trying to recover. sounds like a foul since declining to take a header or half volley is irrelevant in a foul call.>Benatia is not at fault for anything in this entire bit of play.other than allowing an attacker to be free 6 yards out from goal, in the position where benatia should be, and then clattering into him, sure.>Striker who gets space in the box has 2 options. Pass. Shoot.if you possess the ball you can choose whatever you want to do with it as long as it's legal. vasquez could have stood there shielding as long as he wanted to if he was able to control the ball, which he didn't even get a chance to.>First time I see a player trying to get a first touch by backing away from the ball and into opposing defenders.is it also the first time you've seen someone decide that he'd rather not use his first touch on a half-volley to shoot? never seen a corner? you should watch more games because you're really missing out.>violently brutalizednow you're just putting words into my mouth. keep on fighting the good fight. you're doing stellar work."
dx7p40l,sebas8181,"> had it happened anywhere else on the field there wouldn't even be a whistle.Actually the contrary. If it was anywere else it would have been foul AND yellow card without discussion. Benatia got late to the play, didn't even touched the ball, pushed Vazquez and kicked him in the chest. That's a clear yellow card."
dx7pipm,ColonelSwede,De Jong kicked Alonso in the chest. Benatia slightly nudged Vasquez without any force after trying to play the ball and missing. Don't be silly. And the little push in the back was no different than what Ronaldo does to Sandro 5 second earlier. Except that's Ronaldo so it's allowed. Outside of the box this is never a yellow and 5 times out of 10 isn't even called as a foul.
dx7q1f6,Prophet_Of_Helix,"So are you blind or just purposefully ignoring his kick around the front of Vasquez (after the push) that makes no contact with the ball but does hit Vasquez in the chest?It's a foul mate, sorry."
dx7r7s8,ColonelSwede,I've never said it's not a foul.
dx846m0,Prophet_Of_Helix,Go back and read the post I responded to. Certainly sounds like you're arguing that it shouldn't have been called a foul...
dx84iuy,ColonelSwede,"No, you get back and reread the entire comment tree and stop wasting my time."
dx7id8a,worldchrisis,">Putting your leg around people isn't a forbidden play either, defenders do it all the time.Except he made no contact with the ball and kicked him in the side of the chest."
dx7itgj,ColonelSwede,"Except at this point Vazques was already diving anyway. If there's even a foul, he gets fouled while he is diving, basically."
dx7jrnl,worldchrisis,https://streamable.com/j75t0Look at the second and third replays here. Vasquez is taking a small step towards the far post to square up to the ball as Benatia makes contact with his back. You can see Vasquez was focused on the ball and was surprised by the contact by his eyes bugging out. He starts falling from the push and Benatia swings his leg around and kicks him in the side of the chest. There's just no way it's not a foul. Vasquez had position to play the ball and was knocked out of it by Benatia in two separate actions. I thought it was wrong/soft in real time and I wanted Juve to win but I just don't see how it's not a penalty after the replays.
dx7l38e,ColonelSwede,He literally backs into Benatia. What are you even talking about.
dx7t815,worldchrisis,What are you looking at? Benatia is sprinting at his back and Vasquez isn't looking at him and is moving slightly diagonally towards the far post.
dx7wwyy,SuitedPair,"While I also see Vasquez backing up a tiny bit to position himself better, it's clear as day that Benatia made contact which caused Vasquez to go down.Benatia is going full speed trying to time the perfect challenge. Since Vasquez didn't move as he had expected, Benatia ran into him from behind. Definite penalty. Certainly not a dive."
dx7o3ed,doutnik747,"""was surprised by the contact"". Made me laugh... I guess every dive is just the surprise from the (incoming) contact, right?"
dx946da,Redhotchiliman1,Someone is mad barca didn't win against Roma aren't they.
dx7ibfl,Jamesthefifth,"Probably not, because I have no idea what you are on about."
dx7kc6m,e36_maho,That last sentence... It's the other way around m8. They whistle easier outside the box. A penalty has to be a clear foul.
dx7g2s4,RZAAMRIINF,> would be a free-kick anywhere else on the fieldWhat? If it's a foul anywhere else then it's a penalty.
dx7g5td,Ozils_eyes,thats what im trying to say... its a peno
dx7ikln,ACardAttack,"The high kick more than anything made me feel it was a penalty, it was soft contact though"
dx7fqvz,Al_Mondega,"Benatia jumped on his back, pushed him with both hands, and kicked him high. That's a penalty. Deal with it."
dx7fu3j,Ozils_eyes,i didn't say it wasn't a penalty maybe i wasn't clear but i said it would be a free kick anywhere else so its a peno????
dx7g12l,GodsBellybutton,"Just typical poor outlook on life in general, it's the result of years of trolling."
dx7g80u,Tacticalogistics,The Isco goal should've counted anyway
dx7r4ql,Red5point1,"We was not going down at all. He was grounded and readying to head the ball. He had plenty of time to stabilize himself, he was not ""in motion""."
dx7tdek,InsanityPlays,unfortunately pens aren't called the same as other fouls. there's definitely more leeway. i think it's soft but i wouldn't reverse the decision. i just feel bad for juve and buffon.
dx7wgq6,biraboyz,"pretty soft indeed, but big clubs gets away with it the most times. breaks of the game"
dx83fnt,pibechorro,"Agree. He flopped. Didnt even try to hit the ball. The defender did wrsp sround him, but it was normal contsct of a 50 50 and he did clear the ball. The call was soft. And to decide a game on a soft pk is utter 💩"
dx7fj5j,theJulioShow,"Agreed, a bit soft. But it's a clear penalty. Shame game had to end that way."
dx7j746,sebastiankirk,What? It would require brass balls NOT to call that at Bernabeu...
dx7kb0b,Not_available_today,> would be a free-kick anywhere else on the fieldPeople who think this must also believe the penalty was correctly awarded.
dx7kd2w,Ozils_eyes,Correct
dx7lv5p,Not_available_today,Some people would not award the penalty but give a free kick if it was anywhere else - that makes no sense logically.
dx7m12q,1q3er5,to me it looked like he was opening up his arms to chest the ball before being pushed from behind
dx7ouou,sebas8181,"Not to mention Benatia should have been sent way earlier, and he didn't even got carded after the penalty."
dx7oys9,msbabc,He literally kicked him in the chest.
dx8c1bh,iamsofired,"He cant even see the guy, looks like he was trying to control with his chest and put it away."
dx7uy71,clebrink,"Watch it in real time, it's not soft Vasquez wasn't going down before contact, he was positioning himself to control the ball."
dx7fm08,mAte77,"I honestly don't understand how people say it's a ""clear"" pen. Judging from these replays, it looks like an action that happens dozens of times in a game in the middle of the pitch and sometimes doesn't even get called. I get sometimes referees take the rulebook by heart to compensate if they know they've fucked up against the other team (as in, give a pen that's _technically_ a foul, but never gets called inside the box), but I don't think a 98 minute pen suited that criterion."
dx7g687,Alib902,Since that challenge was not on the ball and stopped a goal scoring opportunity of course it is a penalty
dx7girx,crownpr1nce,Benatia is coming fast and Vazquez is standing still. He pushes him in the back and kicks him in the chest from behind somehow. It's not debatable at all IMO. As much as I was hoping Juve would pull through.
dx7goie,mAte77,"Uh?? He doesn't touch his chest at all. Judging by these replays (the replays provided by the link), it's never a pen. In fact, in these replays you can't see contact at all..."
dx7gwro,Swatieson,You are just salty mate. Clear penalty.
dx7h2lm,mAte77,"I mean, go on downvoting me for saying that from these replays, not only there's not chest kicking, but also there's no contact at all. Oh well."
dx7i68q,armypak,you have not still accepted the fact that you are out of QF again in 5 years.
dx7j5t4,mAte77,Totally forgot the cesspool that soccer is after tense games. I'll wait until the 12 year olds are gone
dx7s0da,ballhawk13,Yeah we get tired after interacting with the six year olds.
dx7usxb,iceteka,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaiBn2zX4AAdhjp.jpg
dx7i8ox,crownpr1nce,Watch his leg on the replay coming from the corner ish. His knee definitely hits him in the chest on the side/ribs.
dx7j3vb,mAte77,"From other replays I see it now. From the ones that are posted, I just don't see it. What can I do about it..?"
dx7jd1r,crownpr1nce,Nothing but post more replays so we can all see it! :DBe the MVP we need!
dx7k4ff,mAte77,I wish I was savvy enough to know how to fetch them haha
dx7gv2j,Basura19,"Normally if that happens in the middle of the pitch then it's an aerial challenge. Literally a 50/50 situation. With this one, Benatia has no chance of winning the ball as Vasquez is between him and the ball, and then he lunges on his back with his leg dangling in front of Vasquez. It's a clear pen"
dx7h5h4,mAte77,"Who cares if his leg is dangling in front of Vazquez? If there's contact deserving of a pen, at least it doesn't come from there."
dx7ht46,Basura19,Which there was. The leg thing is just to reference that Benatia had no hope of getting that ball. It's a stupid challenge really. Impeding a player from a goal scoring opportunity
dx7guex,halfmanhalfboat,"Mate , it's clear you're hating just to hate"
dx7up5b,iceteka,https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaiBn2zX4AAdhjp.jpg
dx7rnd2,ballhawk13,I can't wait tomorrow when the narrative correctly turns to how obvious this penalty is after hindsight. I watched it live never doubted it.
dx8h9mz,Ozils_eyes,we all watched it live.... it was soft
dx8soyn,agreedbro,"Yeah the narrative is tainted by it being Madrid imo and people wishing the game had been decided in over time but if you look at the incident objectively, it's a fairly clear pen. He fucking jumps into him, wrapping his leg around him"
dx7n4kr,syn506,[How is this *not* a foul anywhere on the field?](https://i.imgur.com/c2G8Y2u.jpg) Let alone in the six yard box...
dx7nda5,Ozils_eyes,who said it wasn't a foul?
dx7nkes,syn506,I don't get how it's a 'soft' penalty I guess. It's pretty clear.
dx7nqbk,Ozils_eyes,nah it is soft it's one of those you see given like 50% of the time... but there was contact yes... and it is a penalty
dx7nu3n,syn506,I get what you mean somewhat. Here though it's interrupting a clear goal scoring opportunity I guess is the difference. But really it should be a foul anywhere on the field.
dx7nz6g,Ozils_eyes,yes and i agree is is a foul anywhere on the field also thought that benatia should have been sent off
dx7o1bp,syn506,"By the book, he definitely could have been"
dx7r4un,hannonman17,"IMO, 9/10 times it's a pen. But to end the game, so much on the line, with a pen... this shouldn't have been called. I don't favor either time in this game"
dx8sl30,agreedbro,"No where in the rules does it say that time left in a game should influence decisiondt. I also imagine that for top tier referees, it's an instant decision whether it's a pen or not, sorta just doing it by nature like top players doesn't think about finishing a shot"
dx7habv,stcwhirled,Looked soft to me as well but tough call.
dx7fhfy,,[deleted]
dx7fmk6,Ozils_eyes,that's why i said it was a penalty?
dx7fvrz,,[deleted]
dx7g9k4,Ozils_eyes,ok?
dx7h0er,,[deleted]
dx7h63u,Ozils_eyes,came across as bit of a dick bro
dx7j2uu,NZ_Diplomat,That's so odd...
dx7iqbz,BonerGuy69420,"He stopped in front of the ball, threw his hands up, and waited for anything he could call contact. Never had any intention of kicking that ball."
dx7etuk,jka005,Two years in a row Madrid go through in the worst way possible.
dx7f3aw,disruptingtheecho,Terrible challenge from Benitia
dx7fe3a,raff97,I wouldnt call it a terrible challenge. He had to go for it and that was about the best he could have done. Didnt have anything malicious in it either
dx7fr36,heymode,"He knew he had to, but was hoping that ref wouldn't see it."
dx7fy8a,LaPaz_o_Sucre,I think he could have made that challenge without the blatant 2 handed push. Could have just nudged into him with his body and try to put him off as much as he can that way; ref also would be less likely to call the penalty in the final minute with him doing that rather than overtly using 2 hands
dx7loen,goob3r11,Any contact at all and Vazquez goes down. Any player would in that situation.
dx7gzuj,its_dash,Stop watching football. Since when is two-handed push in the box a fair way to win the ball? These ridiculous opinions only show up when Real Madrid is receiving. No one says one shit about how half of the Juve squad should have been given a second yellow INCLUDING Ben Atia. The best team proceeds.
dx7pl3w,raff97,I didn't say it wasn't a penalty. But how can you call benatia an idiot for doing what he did? He did as well as he could have
dx7pwk8,its_dash,I didn't?
dx7p6cg,msbabc,"You're right in the first place. But stop playing victim, it's pathetic."
dx7pd7u,its_dash,It's the truth.
dx7po1k,msbabc,"Zzzzzzzzz it's bullshit, grow up."
dx7xols,ShadowDandy,">The best team proceeds. So, Liverpool and Bayern?"
dx8b02m,its_dash,No I obviously meant Roma lol
dx9idkv,ShadowDandy,"Nah, Roma lost 4-1 the first leg, you lost the 2nd leg, bayern an liverpool not"
dx9ifan,its_dash,Your point?
dx7mpjb,TheDERS22,"Even if it wasn't malicious, that was still a pretty clear penalty to me. That close to the goal, you just can't come in like that. Unfortunate it had to end that way but like the guy said above us, anywhere else on the field that's a foul."
dx7qpae,IrnBroski,"Challenge was understandable, but leaving Vasquez free with less than a minute to go after defending well all half was a catastrophic error."
dx7p4ro,msbabc,Hard for Benatia to judge but he probably had time to come around and make a block.
dx7fnaw,wanted_302,We can't start shoving our boots in front of everyone trying to head a ball just because that's the best we could...
dx7fney,yash1th,nah i don't think he need to. It's not like lucas was in a great composture to shoot. It could've gone either way. But Benatia has been reckless and gifted it to madrid
dx7gvd2,ayotui,He was right in front of goal and Buffon was on the other side of the net. He would have chested that ball in if not for Benatia
dx7g5oc,Random_Acquaintance,What? Benatia had to absolutely do that. What else could he have done? Let Lucas score?
dx7gs3n,IndigoCandyfloss,He could have marked him better to begin with.
dx7qq1j,IrnBroski,This.
dx7gu9c,Ibifurya,"That may be true, doesn't take away the fact it was a penalty."
dx7p7lf,msbabc,Got between him and the goal and made a block?
dx7fod6,maverick1905,"Nobody's gonna hold him responsible here even when it was a stupid and poor challenge.Referee is a cunt, Ronaldo is the Satan himself, Real Madrid is evil. That's the narrative for days to come."
dx7g25c,smekiar2,"I may be retarded and nobody might agree with me, but I think the red card was bullshit."
dx7ga6u,maverick1905,"You said it yourself, mate."
dx7gg1b,smekiar2,"All in all, yeah. But it felt like such a shit end, to such a good game."
dx7gaah,mookiebomber,I disagree. Soccer players seem to be the most violent and aggressive players in all of sports. It's about time a referee penalizes a star for such attitude. Good job on his part.
dx7xu0y,ShadowDandy,Have you ever seen ice hockey? They barely play the sport
dx7fw9x,LaPaz_o_Sucre,I think he could have made that challenge without the blatant 2 handed push. Could have just nudged into him with his body and try to put him off as much as he can that way; ref also would be less likely to call the penalty in the final minute with him doing that rather than overtly using 2 hands
dx7f3db,boo_how_yeezy,hecantkeepgettingawaywithit.gif
dx7ggc9,Mopso,Suck it culés
dx7hip3,boo_how_yeezy,I think you replied to the wrong comment?
dx7fslp,ybenjira,Some would say that we played some above average football in between.
dx7f6qg,TheDrunkHispanic,Yeah because it's totally their fault they get fouled in the box during the last minutes of the game
dx7fas8,jka005,Don't forget the three offsides goals that were allowed against bayern and the six Casemiro reds that weren't shown.
dx7ffam,bissejeck,"I get the exaggeration but last years ref made terrible calls in both directions. Lewa's goal was offside, for example."
dx7g6wg,aquadamn,Vidal on Isco at minute 6 was a red too
dx7fhzm,TheDrunkHispanic,"Did Lewandowski not score an offside goal? If I recall correctly, the reffing was horrible on both ends."
dx7fe0z,I_travel_for_work,Preach
dx7fy0m,ChiefRedEye,What was it last year according to you?
dx7gahh,jka005,"The bayern game, I know the ref was shit in general but both Madrid goals were off and casemiro deserved multiply reds but he had no problem giving one to Vidal."
dx7f5kt,JoshuaFC,Honestly I don't think they'll mind ..just my opinion......
dx7fi0a,32shoe,They'd have just scored had Benatia not given away a pen
dx7fgyy,DellMB,WELL PAID MADRID
dx7f7f4,Mktwoo,"Exactly that's 110% a pen, I don't know why everyone is getting so upset about it"
dx7h609,CarlosFer2201,"As a Madrid fan, I think it was like 3/4. Sometimes that's not enough for a ref to call it."
dx7fues,patchfer,He was already falling before contact.
dx7fz2s,Ibifurya,how? he was posturing his body downward to receive the ball on his chest before he was pushed in the back. this is without a doubt a penalty.
dx7fraa,thoroughavvay,That's the type of penalty that takes a pair regardless of what you do.
dx7fged,Tacosareneat,pretty clear penalty to me. ran right into his back and missed the ball completely. i don't feel that bad for juve
dx7j1f3,arostrat,"Hate to say that, but looks like a penalty.https://imgur.com/a/XxIyI"
dxbhi2v,the_james_howlett,"plus this isnt even at full speed. And for ppl to say he just felt contact and flop i dont see that because he never knows who pushes him, he never sees the defender, he was just all eyes on the ball."
dx7jnrb,spiralism,He's copping a lot of shit but he was bang on with the decision. Pushed and a foot to the chest.Real deserve a lot of credit for creating a chance like that with the last attack of the game. Vasquez was in a superb position to score before being fouled.
dx7ev00,Devanshr7,Yeah that would be given as a foul every time if it was outside the penalty box.
dx7er9d,GoonerMS101,Oliver is one of the best English refs around. Really happy with how he officiated the game today.
dx7f7c7,Friendo101,Buffon should have gotten a yellow.
dx7fj51,JMarduk,"Protesting the ref is a yellow, physically engaging him is a straight red, no matter who you are. I love the man, but this is a red against any ref in the world."
dx7fkdk,acezee,"Buffon got a red. Therefore, the ref has a reason he gave that red. Until that reason comes out, debating is pointless. Whether or not you as a viewer sees the situation as a yellow is irrelevant. Argue the point when it comes out in the ref's report when that discussion can have merit."
dx7fs4j,Family_Guy_Ostrich,"By this logic, arguing anything is pointless. Speculation is free, and not pointless."
dx7hb4j,acezee,"If there's a foul, a kick, an offside position those are arguable. A card in a scrum like this isn't until we know why it was given. If it was for the reaction, then what part of the reaction caused the card and then whether or not that merits a card and what color card is a worthwhile argument. Speculating is fine and entertaining. Coming to a conclusion from speculation is honestly dumb and short sided."
dx7g96e,aquadamn,"As heartbreaking it is, he can't physically engage a ref"
dx7fdvd,qb_st,"You don't know what he told him. Pointless anyway, even Buffon wasn't stopping that."
dx7flnl,Friendo101,"Ronaldo could have shot it differently with Buffon in goal, but yeah he probably wasn't saving it."
dx7et1o,Smithman,He was on the way down before contact.
dx7f0aj,xHUCx,He gets pushed in the back first and then kicked in the chest as he's falling down. Seems like a good call to me.
dx7fkai,Smithman,Jesus. Delusional.
dx7juue,Marco2169,How is that delusion? You seem to be the one of the minority opinion here.
dx7fxmo,corchin,"Weak ass call , countless fouls like that on the box every free kick/corner that went unnoticed and the ref calls this penalty that changes completely the outcome of the match"
dx7f2su,Theart_of_the_cards,Since when has Lucas eyes on his back?
dx7ffxh,fractokf,Never know you need eyes on your back to attempt a dive.
dx7fjeb,Smithman,Oh so now it's not a contact sport? You don't have license to go down the second you feel contact.
dx7fnfl,Theart_of_the_cards,"When the contact us you getting jumped from the back whilst his leg is hugging your stomach, fuck no. Are you daft?"
dx7fsad,Smithman,No you are. He was already on the way down before contact. Watch the alternate angle.
dx7jvwc,Marco2169,"lmao ""no u"""
dxbhodv,the_james_howlett,"meaning that you arent just gonna flop as soon as you feel contact or even sure of who is pushing you. He never knew it was a defender. he never looks. he didnt know, imo he was to focused on the ball, didnt expect the deender, and the fact the dude is twice his size, and at the pace it happened, makes it even worst. gotta keep in mind that all the replays we see are in slow mo, but play that at full speed and it looks more clear"
dx7g3nb,Ibifurya,he was posturing his body downward to receive the ball before getting pushed in the back. very clear penalty. the red card is a separate issue though.
dx7fgob,n10w4,Huh. Now I saw it in slow mo and maybe the defender does touch the ball. But still certain he pushed him from behind
dx7fn54,Smithman,Point being he was going down before contact. It's what you'd expect though in the 93rd minute of a game like this.
dx7r05i,n10w4,is there another angle showing this? So far it looks like he's about to strike and is pushed from behind.
dx7fkcv,,[deleted]
dx7fuaw,Smithman,You can see it in the alternate angle.
dx7fdu6,will_not_,it wasn't him who called it it was the assistant ref
dx7ffnm,intecher,"That guy has balls made of iron holy fuck. I pissed my pants just watching that, imagine actually making the call"
dx7g3nd,grawlyx,It's a stonewall penalty. Gets nowhere near the ball.
dx7h1y9,CarlosFer2201,I believe it was 'generous'. As in a ref would have called it half the time. It wasn't a dive for sure.
dx7iobp,BonerGuy69420,die
dx7jv8o,Dwychwder,Going for the ball. Swallow the whistle. 90 + 8 in the second leg of a tied champions cup quarterfinal is not the time to make questionable calls.
dx7lost,Mantooth77,Yep. 100% a pen.
dx7nksr,Cheewy,"It's very soft to give on any given match, definitely not in extra-overtime to win a quarter final"
dx7nxh7,Solid_Snake_021,At first I was like no then when I saw it from the other side I wasn't too sure if he bruised his ribs or not!
dx8b3me,Pardonme23,Vasquez was kicked in the chest. Easy call really.
dx7ewqd,zieheuer,that's not a call at all imo. especially in that situation you can't give it.ugly decision. it was the lightest of touches and the madrid player was fishing for it.
dx7f1c3,irishperson1,"He has to give that, it's a foul."
dx7f596,IAmTheAnyKey,It's borderline . But yes it's just about a foul I'd say. But there's no denying he went down easy. But then again they all do nowadays
dx7f86j,irishperson1,"If benatia doesn't run into him, he's got a clear chance at goal.He has to win the ball there if he's going in like that which he didn't.No just about in it I don't think."
dx7g0qu,Lame-Duck,I agree. Definitely can't leave it in the refs hands like that at the very least. Certainly within his rights to make the call.
dx7ftg0,IAmTheAnyKey,Alright . But you can't deny it was a shit way to end such a great game.
dx7p0eh,irishperson1,Shitty of Benatia to ruin the teams effort yeah.
dx7fkj9,NZ_Diplomat,"> it was the lightest of touchesOh so there was contact? That's what a foul is mate, push in the back, no matter how light"
dx7f7zn,doutnik747,"Agreed. He just waited for the slightiest touch in order to fall...classic Spanish football.But Champions League semifanals wouldn't look good without PSG, Barca, Real and City so he just had to give a pen right?"
dx7f82f,lerhond,"Yeah it was a penalty, the red card was more sad"
dx7ewkp,jonathonjames89,"Not a pen, you can see him taking his eyes off the ball and stoping dead on the spot waiting for the slight touch. Don't blame Oliver, but it's not a pen"
dx7f0pm,irishperson1,"It's 100% a pen though he runs into the back of him, doesn't touch the ball, leg in his chest."
dx7f9a3,PyreDruid,If that wasn't so late in the game or a deciding goal nobody is complaining about that callThat's completely clearly a penalty.
dx7fb59,irishperson1,"Also a lot of people in the thread wanted Juve to go through, which again makes people complain."
dx7fpum,PyreDruid,"I mean I did too. But that was a penalty, blew it at the end."
dx7f7jb,kirashira,You're trying to say he gave up a point blank shot at scoring to go down for a penalty? Try using your brain a bit more.
dx7gixl,jonathonjames89,"Point blank shot ? Watch the replay, he had loads to do to get his body right to angle that shot. 'Try using your brain a bit more'. It's never as simple as being right next to the goal when you have a defender and a goalkeeper surrounding you. He was looking for it."
dx7f3ni,owiseone23,You can be looking for contact and have it still be a foul. He kind of came over his back even if Lucas was waiting for it.
dx7f4e8,Sonfex,Really ? Vazquez got pushed tho ! But I agree that it was really really close
dx7gxuv,jonathonjames89,"But if this constitutes a push, should we remove all contact from the game to remove any doubt?"
dx7f8nm,Alxndr27,Shit /r/soccer says
dx7eukf,Tweegyjambo,Never a penalty in a million years. Absolutely bottled by Oliver. Total disgrace.
dx7fmiq,mugurg,Soft one but a pen. Benatia could've waited until Lucas controls the ball and then cleared it. Funny thing is Oliver did not show any card to Benatia.
dx7g3of,BliizzardPro,should've just sent it to extra time. at the same time Benatia had strong challenges all night. It was bound to come.
dx7k7ml,I_AM_ALWAYS_WRONG_,You're kidding right? Was a penalty but it's a EUFA competition. Making calls for Barca/Madrid is the easiest thing they do.
dx7kd8f,Alter_Mann,All experts from Sky Germany said they thought it wasn't.
dx7kidq,cityterrace,Brass balls? The game's in Madrid! The ref's suddenly the most popular man in the city after he made that call.
dx7ibbb,garymccall5,"It was never a penalty, when you see it from behind its a clear dive"
dx7es9g,Qwisatz,"Benatia and Buffon are the one to blame, they completely lost their nerve especially the former"
dx7fpd6,IAmTheAnyKey,Benatia yes but Buffon no. If I was in his position I would also be fuckin livid. It's understandable when your team goes down like that then to bring it back and then at the very end have to face a Ronaldo penalty. I mean tough break. He knew it was over as well. No keeper was saving that penalty. It was perfection
dx7g3ji,dalai_llama_,"You just said it, Buffon went fucking livid. He was yelling in the right in the ref's face and up so close he was basically pushing his body is against the ref. I'm sure if it was another keeper in another game you would've thought the ref was justified in giving the red. Don't get me wrong I'm a neutral who was sort of rooting for Juve because they've come so close and it's Buffon's last season as well, but that was a red imo. It's just an absolute shame that it had to be for this player in this game"
dx7gvz3,IAmTheAnyKey,I never said he was undeserving of the card. He definitely was. But it's a shame that they lost like that. And I understand why he was so angry.
dx7ibqo,raf03,"For a guy with so much experience and who doesn't mind winning dirty (check out his comments after Muntari's ghost goal in 2012), Buffon was out of his mind for that red card."
dx7inxe,Yohni,"But who cares? The game was over anyways. Ronaldo was never going to miss. Like why are people even putting Buffon in the convo, the game was over the second the Pen was called."
dx7knks,raf03,"For many, Buffon is an absolute legend and hero that they are longing for him winning CL. That's also the reason why people try to justify and relate to what just happened to him. If anything, this scene is the proof that he is just another player who takes no shit for a bad call made by the ref as long as it's on his favor, not against."
dx7pzk9,dalai_llama_,"I don't think Buffon was going to save the pen either, for me, it's more of a question of how he's ending his CL career. Pretty disappointing way for a legend to go out"
dx8m8uo,Techies4lyf,"Well, zidane was worse"
dx7k9ib,DarnellisFromMars,"It's very likely that Ronaldo hits his pen anyway, he's done it countless times in pressure situations, but there's a better chance of a save if Buffon is still in net. Slim odds, sure, but still possible. With any backup in the world it's much worse odds."
dx7fz4l,Qwisatz,"The ref already called the pen I understand the rage but there is a limit that you need not to cross, touching/pushing the referee is one."
dx7j2w1,the_renegades123,"You are too soft, I was shocked they didn't murder him right there, he was asking for it. Bunch of amateurs juve are they could've found someone with their career almost ending and just knock him out."
dx7x1ok,Mrg220t,People like you are cancer to the sport.
dx7ghm0,BrtGP,Entire backline deserves blame imo. I don't know if it was supposed to be offside trap and looked like Sandro didn't either.
dx7qtmk,IrnBroski,Benatia messed up to leave Vasquez so free.Buffon lost it but ultimately no keeper is saving that.. except maybe DeGea
dx7ix2b,the_renegades123,What nerves? Nobody in their right mind gives a penalty in that way if its not obvious.
dx7elj7,GuessImStuckWithThis,We'll avenge you Juve
dx7f1yo,Naked_Fool,"I hope so, cheering for you people since the start!"
dx7fi6i,FuckThe,I hope they destroy you.
dx7fkuj,GuessImStuckWithThis,5-1?
dx7gksd,FuckThe,"Sure, 5-1, 5-0, 10-0, doesn't matter to me."
dx7fx6w,Yabeauty,"Why? If we win it all, at least you guys can say you were knocked out by the eventual champions which is always something to hold your head up high about!"
dx7ga4x,FuckThe,"Naw fuck that, hope you lose."
dx7gnuw,Yabeauty,"Haha fair enough. I was kidding tho, there really is no pride to be taken in losing to the eventual champions though it's a good little tidbit you can share over time ;)"
dx7f4dp,jimenezs,*draws bayern*
dx7fkhp,fractokf,*Unleash Moreno*
dx7fj6c,dizzyfly_2016,Yes we will!
dx7foq0,gekizaph,As a Madritas... Do your best! I would love to see a former champion get his glory back... But a triple peat would be okay anytime of the day ;)
dx7gly8,pippy64598,lol
dx7fl47,Immediateload,"I hope you're right, in the semi's, of course."
dx7gpa8,lecollectionneur,Please do :(
dx7eusq,iam-alex,Why? Clear penalty. Football lost yesterday when Liverpool went through
dx7emo0,10241988,Would have loved extra time but hey I'm grateful that it was a pretty great game regardless.
dx7ef5d,infestationE15,"Football lost tonight. What an absolute shame.Edit: I didn't make it clear initially, I agree that it was a penalty."
dx7ej5w,JesleyH,"Rules are rules, just because it was last minute doesn't mean it wasn't pen. If Benatia didn't push him he had clear shot on target"
dx7epj0,infestationE15,"It was soft, but I agree that it was a penalty. Still though, every neutral in the world is left disappointed after that."
dx7ex3o,cartola,We're just sad the game ended like this. The penalty was a pretty clear one. If that happened against my team I'd go mental if it wasn't given. Just unfortunate.
dx7exzh,Konker101,How was that soft? He got hit from behind..
dx7fgdc,infestationE15,"Soft as in the contact wasn't incredibly hard, and oftentimes the refs bottle something like that late in the game. I agree the ref got it right, though. Although I didn't make that clear in my initial comment and I'm getting hammered for it."
dx7fqyv,stepanovic,"i don't see a problem with calling it soft. it looks worse as it really was since we have Benatia vs. Vazquez, with around 20cm/30kg difference."
dx7f2bp,ram0h,"it may have been soft, but it was clearly the difference in him scoring it, and that is what matters."
dx7f0yk,TheAuth0r,"Bro he pushed him in a downward motion and then he karate kicked him in the side, how the fuck is that soft?"
dx7il5h,yslithal,"Im not seeing how ""every neutral in the world is left disappointed"" = football lost"
dx7g6a1,SixteenSaltiness,I guarantee you most of the Italian footballing world is happy with this result.
dx7jfk5,xeneize93,I believe that but man I wanted Juventus to go through so bad :'{
dx7eyly,cf858,"There was one angle, from above, where you clearly saw his head snap forward when the hand went onto his back - was hard to see that from the many front-on angles. Was clearly a penalty. People are talking about the ballson Ronaldo for the penalty, man, the balls on the ref to call that..."
dx7gnbc,fagers91,"> Rules are rules, just because it was last minute doesn't mean it wasn't pen. I agree. That being said, in general, that's not really the nature of football refereeing. Rules change a bit as time goes by, a situation in the first 10 minutes might not be a yellow, however it will be a clear yellow later in the game. Webb has talked about this at length among others. Football is a sport where the referee is, to a larger degree than other sports, ""controlling"" the course of the game, in contrast to following the book to a point in every situation. That wouldn't even be possible, since many of the rules involve discretion. For example to what degree a player is allowed ""to go down"", they are allowed to go down when contact, because a penalty wont be given if a player stays up. There is however vague lines between going down by force, contact but could have kept going, overdoing it, and just plain simulation. Don't get me wrong, I think Mariner made the right call tonight."
dx7gpm1,JesleyH,"Aye, such fouls happen every time there's a corner and nothing is given. They are hard done by, other ref would let it go potentially."
dx7exm7,SoydeRosario,"Well, you have ""pushes"" like that in every goddam corner taken and you don´t have penalties awarded in every goddam corner taken..."
dx7ezuw,JesleyH,"Agreed, but during corners everyone is pushing and too much going on, refs just ignore it completely for most parts when they give random penalties at times, doesn't mean they aren't foulsIn this case it was just the two of them"
dx7fhfm,HokiesforTSwift,Do those pushes include high kicking them in the ribs too?
dx7fsim,SoydeRosario,"Sometimes a lot worse.But I don´t think we have a kick in the ribs here. Anyway, maybe I´m seeing this wrong, I´ll look at it again."
dx7glnl,HokiesforTSwift,"It's a shitty way to end the game, surely it's better if the foul doesn't happen but it was the correct call. Vazquez *almost* certainly scores that if he isn't run through from behind, the ref made the correct call."
dx7f1el,theworldisyourtoilet,"What i'm bothered about is how lenient the ref was with Madrid the whole game, as compared to Juventus. I fully understand that this was a penalty, but I'd wish for him to be more equal with what he considers is enough contact to call it a foul."
dx7f6t4,JesleyH,"Well fans in Seria A complain all refs are in favour of Juve, fans in La Liga complain are refs are in favour of Real and Barca, it's just impossible job for them imho. I can't comprehend anyone can enjoy watching Real with all the acting they do throughout the match"
dx7lwii,abdullah10,"Rules are not rules, in this case. Penalty rules are subjective and prone to interpretation. Most referees do not give away soft penalties that could decide a game in the 93rd minute."
dx7enre,Cee-Looow_619,"the pen was okay, the red was an absolute joke.Edit: Maybe I'm wrong, but giving a red after such a heated moment is excessive and unnecessary imo"
dx7er8i,SpazzyBaby,To be fair you have no idea what Buffon said.
dx7f51w,chak100,"The reff thought Buffon pushed him, it wasn't him"
dx7f4pz,johnsom3,I don't care what he said. You can't shove the ref. People defending Buffon are a disgrace.
dx7eqnm,Watchful1,100% the red was because of Buffon mouthing off. Completely on him.
dx7euww,Theart_of_the_cards,Also for being physical. You cant lose your head like this
dx7ewcf,OptsDan,"What are you talking about? If it was Joey Barton or Suarez you'd soon change your tune.No sane person can argue that isn't a straight red. Good on Oliver, stood his ground. Roughing up the ref and shouting in his face is unacceptable.I say all of this as a massive Gigi fan."
dx7etw5,Apolog3ticBoner,You can't shove the referee
dx7ew91,Lorenzo_Insigne,"Red was even more deserved, you can't disrespect and push the ref like he did. If it wasn't Buffon no one would be debating it."
dx7ewfb,Karis_Riscos,How was the red a joke? Bufffon lecturing the ref like he's his son or something
dx7f3q8,zieheuer,the ref ruined the game with the decision. of course buffon is mad as fuck. you can't give a questionable pen like this in that moment.
dx7exed,StatmanIbrahimovic,"Benatia should have been sent off, clear goalscoring opportunity and all.Buffon went mental so I'm assuming it was for dissent, but definitely harsh. Wonder what he said to Oliver..."
dx7f793,johnsom3,Yeah he was already on a yellow. I thought the ref was gonna send him off for a second yellow.
dx7figl,StatmanIbrahimovic,"Definitely, could have easily been a straight red too."
dx7f0wk,Lost_And_NotFound,"That's such a clear red. You can't push and get in the ref's face like that. Everyone always complains about it and as soon as the ref isn't taking it now people are disagreeing. Michael Oliver sent Di Maria off for a tiny tug at the back of his shirt, of course he'd send off Buffon for that."
dx7erw3,cancercures,nah buffon wanted to get ejected.
dx7ew24,Devanshr7,Buffoj pushed him
dx7f4n8,VodkaHappens,"Was it? All I see is a ref surrounded by most of the Juve team and Gigi screaming in his face. From the images I don't doubt he went overboard, we don't have all the facts though maybe he was very respectful in his screaming."
dx7evs5,zimonw,"Oh, hi mr ref, now that you are here can you please tell us what gigi said?"
dx7ez1k,Erickjmz,"Buffon did hit him on the back, weather it was because of the other guys or anything, someone shakes you from the back and you have Buffon yelling at you."
dx7euge,ISCOREDwithISCO,"Well we don't know what Buffon said TBH, plus he was all up in the ref's face pushing him and what not."
dx7ewxw,Tweegyjambo,Never a penalty. Fucking joke.
dx7f5gf,TheAuth0r,Karate kicking people in the box is not a pen? Ok
dx7fedg,Tweegyjambo,Aye ok.
dx7ezzw,stranger7,It was at least debatably a penalty...
dx7eohn,,[deleted]
dx7eqtp,YO_2the_LO,Easy pk call. Quit being salty.
dx7f28x,Brumworth,'Pk call' 'Salty' why must yanks make everyone cringe?
dx7f6u8,YO_2the_LO,"You do know it's to get responses like this one, right?"
dx7elzd,takimora,"A clear short with his chest?edit: there are 6 words in my original comment, none of them are related to the call being correct or not"
dx7enbx,JesleyH,"Whatever it would have been, Benatia prevented it causing a foul. I think it was quite soft, but a foul nonetheless"
dx7eq8m,chose_another_name,"How is that relevant? You don't not award a penalty because you think ""yeah, he had a chance to shoot on goal but tbh it was a difficult chance so he'd probably stuff it up, won't give a pen then.""If it's a shooting chance and he's fouled like that in the box, it's a pen. A soft pen, maybe, but a pen."
dx7g8ce,takimora,"It's not relevant to the call, I'm just pointing out something that I believe is blatantly wrong to the parent comment, because in any other context pointing out mistakes is fine, but apparently not now.>If Benatia didn't push him he had clear shot on targetExcept he hadn't"
dx7ghlc,chose_another_name,"He did. A shot with your chest, or a stooping header from an awkward height, is still a shot.Now, it might not be the highest quality shot, but it's a shot.I think I get what you're saying, but you're trying to call the guy out on a semantic technicality and I'm not sure you're correct."
dx7gyv7,takimora,"Ffs, Vásquez baited the foul, he knew he was in a bad spot for a shot and hoped someone would panic and that was exactly what happened, otherwise he wouldn't have his knees soft waiting for a push. It was a clear chance of goal, but it wasn't a shot and nowhere close to a clear shot, and if you still think otherwise we probably just have different subjective meanings to that word."
dx7f06k,ankitm1,"Then players like Welbeck will never get a penalty. ""get up you whiny arse. You think you could have scored from there?"""
dx7f3os,chose_another_name,This would actually be a hilarious rule change if only to watch refs make fun of players
dx7f4hv,bradimus_maximus,...hey.
dx7eq8x,Theart_of_the_cards,"It was a foul, he fucking jumped in his back wothout the foot in front hitting the ball. A foul is the only criteria for a pen, or am i mistaken?"
dx7fn0k,takimora,"I didn't even say it wasn't a foul, I pointed out it wasnt a clear shot"
dx7foz2,Theart_of_the_cards,"Youre right, sorry for jumping the gun."
dx7fma7,HakeemAbdulOlajubbar,Even more reason why Benatia shouldn't have fouled him there. Buffon had a pretty decent chance of getting there in time to prevent a shot or make a save.
dx7fq4m,takimora,"Sure, I can definitely can behind that, Benatia should've been more careful."

dx7flw3,JesleyH,Gotta rush for that sweet karma lmao
dx7gwrs,hungry4nuns,> Rules are rulesIs it a rule to automatic red card for protesting a decision? because ronaldo could've been sent off multiple times for his appeals
dx7h0zi,JesleyH,"Well I am not fan of the acting and diving Real do, in fact I can't comprehand how anyone can enjoy watching them play at all, but Buffon went quite ballistic, it was a different level to Ronaldo and your usual protesting"
dx7i7dm,hungry4nuns,"Agreed it was hot headed however given the gravity of the situation, a good ref would have kept his head, given a warning shot of a yellow and followed it quickly with a red if not heeded. You could see Buffon was fired up with emotion the entire match but was not a danger to other players nor was he attempting a professional foul. Nobody would have criticised the ref (except Madrid fans) for showing yellow, especially after what he let ronaldo get away with in terms of continuous protests."
dx7s8rx,thedeliberative,He didn't push him. Jesus fuck.
dx7enc2,Kenarsene,"Where was the push? Lmfao, he literally reached around and got his leg in to clear the ball away, nowhere in that challenge did he use his hands."
dx7eqlx,detinu,He pushed him from the back right before he goes with his leg across him. It was a pen.
dx7exxx,Tweegyjambo,Rubbish.
dx7f04d,hehemyman,"There is a push every time a player is in the box, it never gets called when its that soft"
dx7fi2w,BeesAreStingers,"Barca has been proven to get a penalty on getting players pushed, even though the ball was other way and the players had no connection with where the ball was."
dx7fwim,hehemyman,Yeah and that Suarez pen shouldn't have been given
dx7g8kj,BeesAreStingers,"I wasn't speaking about that. [This] (http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2292/editorials/2012/04/05/3015364/referee-broke-the-law-in-awarding-second-barcelona-penalty) is what first came to mind, which I am still salty after 6 years. Yet you can't negate that referees have been favourable to Barcelona in CL at least."
dx7eqc1,jordank94,I forgot it's legal to put your foot into somebodys chest
dx7exlj,Kenarsene,"Yeah bro, he definitely came in foot first right onto his chest. Studs were towards the ball, challenge was for the ball. Lucas felt benatia on him and went for the dive. Worked out in the end, I guess. Madrid have been aching for that penalty call all game lmfao"
dx7eunq,RevengeOfTheDwarfPig,C'mon man. He put both his hands in the square of his back.

dx7gu23,NoSoyTuPotato,"Still gotta do it cleanly. Can't just kick somebody in the back and pawn it off as a no call because ""he wasn't trying to foul""if he somehow go to the ball first without making contact, it would've been clean. There is a reason that you're allowed to shield the ball with your body."
dx7etz3,wtfigot,He was already falling before Benatia touches him.
dx7ekc5,monnii99,Why did football lose? It was a correct call imo
dx7eslp,TooSwissToWrestle,After all the bitching we get about refs shitting it in big moments/matches we finally get the mother of all decisions and people are complaining about it. Credit to him for not losing his nerve.
dx7pifi,msbabc,"Generally, I'm no fan of Michael Oliver, but he got this right"
dx7enr0,bustedracquet,Because we lost out on what would have been an amazing extra time + possible penalties.
dx7f07k,BeardedSwashbuckler,Has there ever been an amazing extra time? Players are tired and terrified of making mistakes so its usually pretty boring with both teams parking buses.

dx7f6zh,tanu24,Which is why it needs a golden goal
dx7fjj1,Ractrick,"Golden goal made it even worse, games became so defensive it looked like teams were terrified to enter the oppositions half, which is to be expected when the penalty for conceding is so great. Glad we've moved on from it."
dx7fzna,tanu24,Take away the Pens and make it golden goal. Someone gotta win so you can't sit back Pens suck to decide a winner
dx7g4vm,EtoshOE,"Ooooh next goal wins in the Champion's League, neat"
dx7gjue,tanu24,It's much better since it's actual soccer/football for a winner instead of people lining up for pens.
dx7fpuz,tibetanguywithadog,"Golden goal is way too harsh. Maybe after team A scores a goal, give 10 mins for team B to score back or end it when team A scores another. So it'll keep going until one team can't score back within 10 mins or one team scores two in a row."
dx7fwl5,tanu24,No it's not you've played for 90 + minutes and now it's extra time. Next goal wins is playing actual football until a goal decides it.
dx7fdet,TZMouk,"Should just go straight to penalties. Although I wouldn't be against trialling some kind of penalty format similar to Hockey, with players dribbling from the edge of the centre circle before going one on one. But I get that idea might not go down well."
dx7fpm8,tanu24,Pens are the worst way to choose a winner. It's just awful and thank god hockey only does it for regular season.
dx7gzso,TZMouk,They're better than extra time in which both teams just sit back.
dx7ix72,tanu24,Golden goal and Pens go. Can't sit back then
dx7fwtb,silkysmoothjay,[It's similar to how the old NASL did it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJEnwi7otu0)I'd agree with you. This style of shootout is a way better way of determining the better team than spot kicks.
dx7h1wa,TZMouk,"No idea how they'd work in practice, but I like the idea that they involve more skill than just straight pens."
dx7fdws,AtticusLynch,I like that ideaBut you smell like kneepit sweat so I have to disagree
dx7fsbq,tanu24,How did you know that?
dx7jgdk,AtticusLynch,I like that color shirt you're wearing
dx7f6af,tanu24,Pens are the absolute worst way to end a game. I'll take this over those any day
dx7f1mq,quacainia,"Yeah, it's not the refs fault, it's just sad to see such a great draw end with a last second penalty, and a red to an all time greatIf it'd have been shot in it would have been a great finish, just not the outcome I'd wanted"
dx7f068,VinceJumpmanCarter,"It's incredible how jammy this Madrid side is. They've looked vulnerable for the most part, but somehow always gets the job done in the CL."
dx7f1fl,TheMilleniumFalcao,Yeah but we got some absolute scenes
dx7f17p,skutan,"Juve would defend deep and play risk free like they did after the 3-0 goal, and Real would get more cautious as well the further it went, because an away goal would be disastrous for them. So ut probably wouldnt be champagne football lol but it's still sour that it ended like THAT."
dx7ezvl,ChedduhBob,Yeah we should have played extra football instead of following the laws of the game
dx7f78a,Khornag,He just said it would be fun to see. I can understand that it would be from a neutral perspective.
dx7f26m,bustedracquet,"I didn't say we should, I said football lost because we didn't get to see it."
dx7f0wz,Yankee_Gunner,"This is a reasonable opinion, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say the OP was upset about the penalty call."
dx7f6zt,truthdemon,But we got a batshit insane finish instead.
dx7fd47,etonB,think this is as exciting as an ending as we could've gotten
dx7fhru,bustedracquet,I guess. I would have loved to have seen pens.
dx7fd4q,theonlyjuan123,It wouldn't have gone to extra time?
dx7fh6o,bustedracquet,"Yes it would've, it was tied on aggregate and each team had 3 away goals."
dx7hkkp,theonlyjuan123,For some reason I thought it was 4-1. My bad
dx7oaei,geraldkrasner,"That doesn't mean football lost. Football win because the ref made a correct call and we got a dramatic, legally correct finale."
dx7qpr5,Zosoer,Everyone loses when a game is decided on penalties
dx7ensq,iainturfather,It was definitely the right call...
dx7esrh,n10w4,"Yeah looks like the right call. Defender didn't even touch the ball, did he?"
dx7ewgz,Blewedup,Striker looked like he flopped.
dx7f6jl,Canefan101,I mean it looked like he made the most of it after 3 slow mo replays but in real time that's a penalty 100/100
dx7fb03,procrastinating_ftw,"So if we're talking with practical rules, you can't have you hands on a strikers back in the box let alone jumping on him and kicking him Because he might flop.If were talking literal rules where a foul out of the box is a foul inside the box, that's at the very least obstruction of play"
dx7fojs,fgdadfgfdgadf,Didn't seem to have his hands on his back though
dx7g2l9,procrastinating_ftw,Didn't say that. I said you shouldn't do that in the box **let alone** jump on and kick someone
dx7f73j,Memeions,Don't you instinctively fold in your legs if you're touched in the chest?
dx7ewtr,jeric13xd,Haters gonna hate
dx7hfat,HavardP,"It was not ""definately"" the right call. When opinions are so split i'd rather say its a call that could go either way. Stating your opinion as a fact really isnt something you want to be doing."
dx7hjnu,iainturfather,Lol thanks for the advice bud.Definitely*
dx7eon3,squeenanna,Because of what could have been.
dx7esue,thatswavy,100% the right call and I wanted Juventus to win. Anyone who says otherwise is flat-out wrong.
dx7epk7,KSF_WHSPhysics,"It was definitely a pen, I would have like to see buffon have the chance to save it though (granted nobody could have stopped that shot). He must have said some vile shit to the ref"
dx7feyo,Alvarus94,Think it was more the contact than anything else. People say what they want but you can't touch the ref.
dx7fgx6,Osceana,>He must have said some vile shit to the refI don't blame him at all. He said himself this is probably his last CL and this is the ugliest way to go out. The penalty was right but it's still a cheap way to end a CL campaign. It's like Zidane WC level disgrace.
dx7ep6d,NanookOTN,I'm surprised so many people think it wasn't a foul. He came straight through the back of him.
dx7er9u,PM_ME_I_LOVE_NUDES,Yeah and still dramatic and exciting. And I wanted Juve to go through.
dx7fesu,LordElrondd,I'm very impressed that they saw that and he actually called it.Im sad Juve didn't make it though.
dx7erko,Chemical_Robot,"Yeah I wanted Juventus to go through as well but that's a good call. Tough one to make, but the right one."
dx7etu9,maverick1905,"Exactly. Everyone was crying here over missteps in yesterday matches but when a referee makes a completely legit call here, he gets crucified. He was very good tonight. And he had the balls to call the penalty when it was necessary. Respect to him."
dx7f36r,Tweegyjambo,It was a terrible decision. You are allowed contact. It's a contact sport.
dx7enjb,GuessImStuckWithThis,50/50. Still sucks when you see a player fall down like a sack of shit.
dx7etfj,Keyann,"Can't come in from the back like that, maybe 20 years ago but not in today's game"
dx7eqkd,netolokao,"50/50 at best, on a usual game moment.Extra time on a CL Quarter-Final? That's not a fucking call you take and fuck with the game."
dx7fa8i,monnii99,Calls shouldn't be based on the minute they took place in.
dx7fgza,netolokao,"If it's a 50/50, you simply don't make the call. Why risk the game integrity by handing an chance for a decider on the last minute of the game on, by calling something that you can't be certain that was a penalty?"
dx7fg82,SirGalahadTheChaste,Or where on the field. A foul is a foul which this was.
dx7exss,Devanshr7,Why not? Rules are rules
dx7g7ij,prawntheman,How was it a 50/50? Vasquez was literally between Benatia and the ball. How was it 50/50?wtf
dx7f0g9,Tweegyjambo,He fucking dived. It's a contact sport.
dx7f55h,netolokao,"I disagree with the call too. But depending on the angle that you see it, you might think it was a penalty. But a ref shouldn't be making the call on something that LOOKS like a penalty, he should be 100% certain of it."
dx7ewo5,onemangoboi,The referee was no doubt in the heat of the moment but that call was a fucking disaster.
dx7eu6v,daveedgamboa,"That's what I don't get. Looks like he went down early as soon as he felt any contact. In a game this big and in that moment, you don't make that 50/50 call. Just nuts"
dx7euw9,10241988,Lost half an hour of extra time but yeah I agree
dx7f1h5,VexeenBro,"Of course it was, but remember you're on r/soccer."
dx7l81o,Caesar10240,"Even if it is the right call, it is shitty that a great tie ended with a pk. It just a shitty way to end it."
dx7ewsy,John_Dillinger7,"Most definitely; it's just people who wanted Juve to win. They fought extremely well but a mistake at this point of the tournament means you might and will lose, as just happened."
dx7eo6k,,[deleted]
dx7f7be,monnii99,So it wasn't a correct call?
dx7exfp,Cheezzhead,Because ronaldo has been diving all game and if he wasnt a superstar player he wouldve been given cards for it.It is fucking bullshit how often real wins like this. The amount of penalties they get in clutch situations is unreal.Football lost tonight.
dx7f41e,monnii99,So you are complaining about how they got a correct penalty? They shouldn't have gotten it?
dx7g7iq,Cheezzhead,Do you think real deserved to win?
dx7gavm,prawntheman,"We didnt win, did we?"
dx7gmvq,Cheezzhead,"You dived and whined and gesticulated for cards, you played horrible and received 3 goals in your own home, and in the end you got through to the semifinal. Just like last year against Bayern. In short, you symbolise everything that's wrong with football."
dx7hb0r,prawntheman,You whine about the correct penalty call. Yes we played horribly at home but so did Juve in Allianz. So what is the point of mentioning that? And i suggest you watch the Bayern game again and count all the wrong calls and start making score.
dx7hujb,Cheezzhead,"It is not the correct penalty call. If you look at how referees are trained (referee's handbook), almost every situation is allowed leeway. The goal of the referees is to keep the game fair while making a minimal impact on said game. Oliver did the opposite of that; not only did he decide the game over a foul that is (despite what most people are claiming) a 50/50, he also allowed the Madrid side - and Ronaldo in particular - to keep diving and complaining without any reprimand whatsoever. This despite the fact that their captain, who I don't need to remind you has the dubious record of most red cards in La Liga, was suspended. And then after all that shit, he sends Buffon off? Get the fuck outta here, how can you even support a team like that and call yourself a football fan."
dx7ia5d,prawntheman,"Wait wait. So you are telling me all this because you automatically feel like you have the right to assume the authority to decide that the foul was 50/50, in contrary to what the referees, Madrid fans, most neutral fans (or 'most people' to quote you) and commentators say? You are pretty presumptuous, aren't you? And you base all your insults and opinions of me after that on your misguided opinions? Okay, sure I'll take you seriously."
dx7eqos,ragingasian15,"Penalty was the correct call, red card is a sign of power tripping and this needs to be investigated. Just like last year. VAR needs to be implemented."
dx7eos4,E_EqualsDankCSquared,And the game was entertaining af. These people tripping of they think it should've been given a wrong call SMH
dx7ifev,pleasesayavailable,"A 0-0 game with no shots on target can be called right the whole way through, still footballs the loser.It would have been magic for Juve to overcome a 3 goal defecit, sad it ended this way"
dx7ejov,DamnTomatoDamnit,https://i.imgur.com/hyI9ItE.gif
dx7eoig,137-451,What a fucking stupid comment
dx7faw0,ImissDenisirwin,What a fucking stupid comment
dx7fe7z,Jonrahn,How so? Many neutral fans were rooting for the underdogs being Juventes.
dx7iekg,cdbriggs,Well Underdogs losing doesn't mean Football loses
dx7iqsf,Jonrahn,True. I think he is saying that the football community loses. Not the integrity of the game
dx7ihqk,pleasesayavailable,"In this circumstance it does? Would have been brilliant to see extra time and Juventus go through, pretty sure it's what every neutral was cheering for"
dx7rdj3,AlmdudlerBoy69,Nobody gives a fuck what you think
dx7eqff,kdm1998,Lmfao why did football lose? Buffon was acting like a fucking twat vs the ref and got a deserved red card. If this was Dani Alves you'd be laughing at him.
dx7evjr,allahu_akbar_boom,Calm down Xavi.
dx7es8x,BendItLikeWhiteside,What? It's a penalty!
dx7epqn,sheedz225,"What the fuck do you mean? It was a clear penalty. EVERYONE from Barcelona fans to the actual commentators and critics are saying so, clear contact and push on Vazquez. Juve fucked themselves over like that. Plain and simple"
dx7ev07,lasagnyewest,who gives a shit what the ass commentators say lol
dx7f113,cheecheepong,Save your salt for your pasta.
dx7eu6u,beavz,"Football lost? If anything Football won because the ref had the balls to make the correct call in a massive moment in the game. Overall The game was 50-50, Madrid dominated away, Juve dominated away. It came down to one error, and one kick. Thats what makes this game amazing."
dx7esss,FMetalhead,Juventus played their hearts out but Real Madrid were mentally stronger and Buffon really should've kept his composure there. It's a shame he reacted that way but Ronaldo stepped up.Inb4 any flair-related comment
dx7f0er,Rodsoldier,Because a team that took a 3-0 loss managed to win 3-0 and make a penalty in the end ? If anything it really looked like a penalty live.
dx7f1kc,johnsom3,Really? I thought it was a thrilling game and a movie script finish.
dx7f540,Djimq777,"Football lost for enforcing the rules, ok man whatever you say."
dx7fgpd,adtv1,Shut up. It was a brilliant game.
dx7fgwl,BubSwatPunt,"I respectfully disagree, that was fucking incredible. My jaw was agape watching that unfold. One of the craziest endings I've seen."
dx7h44q,titooo7,I'm guessing that all those who upvoted your comments are Juve fans.I don't see why football lost today
dx7eww6,Everton210er,"Just because it goes against the fairy tale that could have been, doesn't mean it was not a penalty"
dx7eomp,EddieBravosBong,Hahaha how? Juve barely played football and got lucky with the 3rd goal. Also constantly fouling.It was a legitimate pen won by the best player on the pitch. Can't complain.
dx7eopa,MrKearns,Football lost because the referee made the right call? No one force Juve to lose the first leg 3-0.Spackers on here acting like someone died...
dx7eup3,harboursand,"What are you on about ""Football lost tonight"" - Juve played well but made a mistake towards the end. At the top level, you will be punished. This is what football is all about.The call was correct. Michael Oliver and his team were spot on the whole night."
dx7eyg1,D3monFight3,"Entertainment lost tonight, not fotball the right call was penalty."
dx7k129,BoonOfIre,His narrative lost today
dx7eio5,nocendi,Every now and then we get a harsh reminder why this game needs video refereeing.
dx7embr,fools_eye,"Why do you think it's not a penalty?Benatia goes through Vazquez, there is no way the referee can call it any other way."
dx7ersu,aquadamn,"It seems like he has the ball before Vazquez, and that doesn't seem reckless unless I'm unaware of somethingis there any better AA out there :/?"
dx7f0vw,fools_eye,"He has literally gone through Vazquez though, the replays shown in this post are clear enough."
dx7f2pu,labtecoza,He literally kicks him in the chest after pushing him while being nowhere near the ball
dx7eqip,Ljpancake,Because there was not nearly enough contact for this to be a foul. He went down when he felt contact. Any other sport would have called this embellishment. It's an institutional problem in soccer and it is my least favorite part of the beautiful game
dx7f76c,Tweegyjambo,You are completely right. It was a dive.
dx7faez,Ljpancake,"I wouldn't say dive as much as embellishment, but yeah"
dx7ff89,Tweegyjambo,Yip.
dx7eye9,fools_eye,"Mate, Benatia has gone through his back before he comes anywhere near the ball, it is a textbook foul. Illegal contact enough to put off Vazquez is only needed for it to be called a foul."
dx7f6ni,Ljpancake,"I understand what you mean, I truly do. But could he have stayed up and headed or kicked it? Absolutely no doubt about it. I'm not not saying there was no contact, I just believe soccer players in general go down to get the foul rather than playing through it. Just my opinion from playing as a defender at the college level, if you slow every play down, they will almost always look like fouls."
dx7fjhj,Ljpancake,"Also I don't know why someone downvoted you here, these are all just opinions. I'm glad to hear yours"
dx7f51a,Devanshr7,Boot on chest. Always a foul
dx7eysb,nocendi,"Almost no physical contact at all, and he hits the ball with the kick. Yeah, I really don't see that as a penalty at all. You honestly can't be serious about him ""going through"" him in that one. I get that people might feel like kicking ""around"" a player warrants a penalty, that's debatable for sure.But the contact from behind is absolutely minimal."
dx7f753,fools_eye,I don't think you are watching the same incident I am then.
dx7fbau,nocendi,That does indeed appear to be the case.
dx7embs,Spacecabbage,Why did it need video ref? To show even more definitively that Buffon should have been red carded? I love the guy but he lost it.
dx7ermx,Theart_of_the_cards,Because of the bandwagon and Buffon deserves the UCL.
dx7fluk,NoSoyTuPotato,imagine Ramos doing that tackle. nobody would deny the call and this subreddit would go into uproarit's funny seeing all the people judging the call with bias and can't realize that
dx7ezgi,nocendi,I don't think anyone questions that Buffon's red card was correct.
dx7ep8x,Gaz133,To spend five minutes reviewing a call the ref got right the first time?
dx7eszl,real_shadowave,"That was a penalty with or without VAR, doesn't matter if Buffon is on the other side or Juventus completes a fairy tale comeback. The ref got that absolutely right especially with so much pressure on him"
dx7fbd1,Tweegyjambo,He dived as soon as he felt contact. It is a contact sport.
dx7fypf,real_shadowave,It was a scoring chance right in front of the net and Benatia ran right through his back. Vaszques controls the ball on his chest and obviously will attempt to shoot it in. If someone runs right into your back and almost kicks you in the front he is committing a foul.The fact is Benatia wasn't positioned correctly and therefore committed a mistake. There was very little chance he could have stopped Vasquez from shooting that in without fouling him.
dx7enbv,MrKearns,Video referee would have backed him up. It was a penalty.
dx7eo59,barongbord,So the video ref can confirm the correct call?
dx7eogt,a_lumberjack,VAR would still give it. He clearly goes through the player to try to get the ball. Benatia lost the fucking plot in the last five minutes.
dx7enp2,Total-Annihilation,Pen was the correct call.
dx7enrh,phdre,That's a penalty upon review.
dx7eoa2,KungFuGreen,that was a fuckin pen
dx7enfw,9180365437518,and the video referee would still give that a fucking pen
dx7f08l,ram0h,what would have been different?
dx7fen4,nocturn-e,To confirm it was a penalty?
dx7eq5h,Nico2845,"He's late and pushes him in the back, that's a penalty anywhere and unfortunately for Juve anytime."
dx7er9g,philipstyrer,How is flying into the back of an opposing player with your hands first not a foul?
dx7eval,nocendi,I think you need to watch the replay again.
dx7f76f,labtecoza,You're clueless
dx7fffa,nocendi,"Yes, people who disagree with you are universally idiots. That's always true."
dx7f41a,philipstyrer,I think you do.
dx7eq8e,archjones,WhatWhy?
dx7esbz,mv8,"Why? The referee made the right decision, stop saying its a disgrace just because it didn't end like you wanted."
dx7eu0u,Lorenzo_Insigne,Juve losing is always a win for football.
dx7evdr,ISCOREDwithISCO,Football lost? Fuck off
dx7esge,d0m1n4t0r,How does shit like this get upvoted lmao
dx7f3d5,CommiePatrol83,It isn't Champions League if Real doesn't win with the help of a red card ;)
dx7eq83,moneypennycashdollar,How does this shit get upvoted? It was a clear pen
dx7er0h,Shimomo1,"He kicked him, clear pen. Also Buffon should have shut the hell up and not got sent off."
dx7eswl,Jeffy29,"Started cheering for Real, but at the end I was pulling for Juve, I think penalty was 100% fair but I still can't help to feel how fucked up the ending was."
dx7euz9,floridali,It did not deserve to be called at 90+7. Idk maybe it's the romantic in me speaking.
dx7ezie,Styphelus,It was a penalty. Too bad it happened right at the end but if he didn't get pushed he had a clear shot on goal.
dx7ezih,SenoraRamos,"Lol, what?"
dx7fqkf,Daft-TK,Football lost... the absolute state of you. You really are Reddit personified you fucking wanker.
dx7ez3b,shovelle,"i don't really watch soccer, im a hockey guy. boy was that a great example of how soft this game is. you always see example of soccer players laying on the ground crying cuz they were tackled from behind or the coach who acted like he was concussed from a paper airplane hit to the head, but seeing that call now makes even the refs seem like garbage. i'll never understand this sport."
dx7ezpe,Bini_9,"I agree, even though if you follow the rulebook it is a penalty."
dx7eyqe,MrKreeps,Not sad! That was fucking intense!
dx7euyz,lKyZah,the one thing i said was plz dont end in a penalty
dx7fjti,yapzilla,ya h8 2 c it
dx7h3nk,DrGoverno,He stole the penalty
dx7if6o,Theart_of_the_cards,"2.5k upvotes and no replies, what is this fuckery?"
dx7lxew,PM_ME_ANIME_ASS_69,Not really
dx7mcyt,Shill_Borten,I thought you were fine with refs deciding the tie?
dx7e8c5,sSJOw,Unfortunate way to end the game

dx7erdl,NemoOfManyColours,"Hey, I know of someone who ended his football career in a similar way and now is managing RM ..."
dx7fd4t,reddhitghost11,Gotta be a bald to be a fraud. Gigi has nice hair.
dx7hux7,,I also don't think anyone who is not bald can pull off such a headbutt considering basic aerodynamics
dx7n5fa,Shill_Borten,"Maybe he will wear a cap, and be a true 'bald fraud'?"
dx7ftir,clexecute,"I mean, not like Buffon would have saved the PK."
dx7fvnl,fesses_flasques,and it was against buffon. world's so small
dx7f9ai,IAmSkylarWhiteYo,Gigi wished he could finish his international career in the same way as that RM manager.
dx7ff7h,ProudKingbooker,Gigi beat that Real manager but whatever....
dx7fpcf,SSacamacaroni,as said revenge is a dish best served cold
dx7fwaq,earnNburn,"I don't speak French, but it sounds incredibly similar to English to me!"
dxev6jt,SSacamacaroni,"yeah for some reason I worded it in french in my mind then intended sth more along the lines of ""as the saying goes"" when i realized it was also used in englando ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ as it turns out the expression does originate from french literature but that spectacular brain flop tho"
dx7frt7,IAmSkylarWhiteYo,Yeah. But ended his international career by not even qualifying for the WC.
dx7hy4v,limeonion,Should've head-butted the ref
dx7nyui,kvng_stunner,So you're saying Buffon will lead Juve to 2 Champions League titles in the 2020's.
dx7fiwm,throwaway-heee-hooo,"He had already won the competition he was competing in though, unlike Buffon"
dx7flto,mpkotabelud,The Zidane exit interview

dx7em65,-_-_-_-otalp-_-_-_-,Or your football career essentially
dx7fiu3,DellMB,I WISH BUFFON HIT THAT REFEREE.IT'S HIS LAST MATCH ANYWAYS.
dx7f0qd,Erickjmz,Buffon went full Zidane.
dx7fxuu,clexecute,"I don't get how people are comparing the 2. Zidane was literally carrying France on his back and left the game, the dude who missed his PK would have been where Zidane shot.Buffon went out after a 93rd minute questionable PK call against one of the greatest goalie scores of all time. Buffon being in the game would have made almost 0 difference, no goalie was saving that PK..."
dx7gh4s,Erickjmz,"Two players that have had a clean career, known for being ""gentleman"" kind of players, on basically their last important match of their career get a red card on a stupid action."
dx7fziy,smala017,He saw Zidane on the sidelines and was inspired...
dx7h5rs,Hirshologist,"Meh, I think it's kind of bad ass. End your champions league career on a red card is better than ending it with Ronaldo scoring the penalty."
dx7ohi4,toxicroach,It's actually a pretty epic way to go out. I mean that red card will be legendary.
dx7fizk,nikc00hopa,What is up with nobody cunts acting horrible to guys like Buffon?
dx7f0tn,D3monFight3,"I mean end aside, he was a god tonight."
dx7q1rp,Flovust,"i dont follow soccer at all, but why is this unfortunate?"
dx7tfrp,Hemske,"Because a 3-3 QF (3-0 first game, 0-3 second game) ended in a questionable penalty on overtime. Most people would have preferred to see it end with a ""real"" goal."
dx7wxr4,ArmoredKappa,I liked it
dx7fh1p,noob07,"Yup but the rules are rules. That is a clear pen and a straight red for buffon. No discussion needed. Also , i hardly say this nowadays but great job Micheal Oliver. Every call he made was correct one. We talk a lot abt shit officiating but come on people, you gotta give credit here. Massive balls shown to not bottle it and make the right call. Good job✌️"
dx7etw7,cancercures,buffon would rather get ejected and end his career like that than end his career letting Ronaldo put one in the back of the net on the PK.
dx7g6ss,Monucan,Finally ronaldo doesnt score against him

dx8gr59,29Martin92,The only way to win is pay the ref *
dx8h6j4,luigitheplumber,No need to pay a ref for penalties when Benatia shoves and kicks a player in the box.

dx7m5ws,MrRivet,That seems.... much worse to me.
dx8eszl,danncos,"I would like for my last goal to have been scored by Ronaldo, rather than someone no one will remember 100 years from now."
dx8gefq,suddenswimmingpotato,Vasquez did drop like a sack of shit tbfVery soft
dx7g3r4,RS_51,Can we talk about RONALDOS LEAP TO HEAD IT DOWN TO VASQUEZZ
dx7hlox,CynicDucky_83,"Just as Buffon said - even on a day when he isn't at his best, he sure as hell knows how to be decisive."
dx7oxj0,Fresherty,"Given how many times he tried to fish penalty with blatant dives, it's a testament to modern football he wasn't sent off. At this very moment he had a decisive impact, sure - there's no denying that. However he deserved 2nd yellow around 50th minute mark. Ref was spot on with actually recognizing them too, just didn't have enough balls to pull yellow (and possibly 2nd one, but obviously it would change everything)."
dx8bloj,stealthmodemf,I just love some salt after an epic game.
dx8li48,Abracajayvee,save some salt for me
dx7i6mf,MisterVS,That was amazing and good composure under pressure.
dx7mrsd,positivelyjc,"Agree here. At first I thought Ronaldo was going for goal and it deflected off his defender. On second watch, it's clear he saw Vasquez unmarked running into the box. Great play."
dx7e7rl,maradonnasplug,Poor Buffon
dx7ed2v,Rusty51,The Zidane retirement
dx7epdh,Phenixxy,12Y chess from Zidane
dx7gpih,Thenateo,Y for years?
dx7gyaf,Phenixxy,Indeed
dx7et2y,seesame,Juve just earned great coach then
dx7eh0p,ederzs97,Zidane had already won the trophy he was competing in though...
dx7esjl,Andres315,Mmmmm world cup final?
dx7ew1k,Dickinmymouth1,"Yeah he'd won the World Cup before, Buffon hasn't won the CL before."
dx7f07e,fgdadfgfdgadf,Yeah who the fuck would want two world cups 🙄
dx7f3bf,Dickinmymouth1,"Not the point, it's more that at least he's not getting sent off in his last World Cup game having never won it before, whereas Buffon got sent off in his last CL game having never won it before."
dx7gkg4,Joeonandoff,"Youre not wrong, just the comment replying to you was funny lol"
dx7j8vo,sleeptoker,at least this wasn't the final
dx7f8xd,Jay716B,You're kind of scratching the bottom of the barrel here lol. Let's try to focus on the fact that Buffon AND Zidane got red carded on their final games. Champions league and World Cup respectively. Winning the trophy before or not doesn't matter.
dx7fpdo,Osceana,">Winning the trophy before or not doesn't matter.Strongly disagree. It's frustrating to go out either way, we all get your point, but it adds to the frustration when it's escaped you for so long."
dx7femx,Dickinmymouth1,"I wasn't the one bringing it up, I was jus explaining what someone else meant. Having not won it before will absolutely make it harder for Buffon though. Of course Zidane would regret the way he went out but he can still look back on his career having won a World Cup. Not shitting on Buffon here, but I'm sure the feeling is absolutely worse that he knows he's never going to be able to win the Champions League."
dx7fmow,Jay716B,Im sure Zidane didn't find closure at all just because he won the trophy already. I've never seen a player play off a lost competition by saying they already won it.
dx7fqol,Dickinmymouth1,"We're just going round in circles here. I am certain it doesn't give him closure over how his career ended, however I'm sure he's a lot happier with his career as a whole despite how it ended having won the World Cup than he would be if he hadn't."
dx7h66a,Andres315,"I see, thought you were implying he had already won that particular cup (as in that year's world cup)"
dx7f2ou,Rodsoldier,It happens every 4 years and it's a huge step in climbing up the all time great ladders.
dx7m3j1,jakesonwu,Once with Juve
dx7j89q,sleeptoker,Not while I was conscious :(
dx7fpje,Godzilla_Tits,Yeah but he fucked his team mates that hadn't in that final.
dx7j38k,virginiadicky,"It wasn't him that blew penalty kicks and it hasn't him who decided that Barthes should have ever been in goal in the first place. Honestly I detest the Italian team with all my hatred because of their diving and flopping even if I love Italians and Italy, but France was lucky to even be there and Italy should have beat them about 4-1."
dx7ex4i,CmdAltB,The Jürgen Kohler retirement
dx7el5a,nocendi,"I don't think either one of them really gives a shit about the red card, just about losing."
dx7mz8s,ImTalkingGibberish,"Yes, he'll be managing Real Madrid then"
dx7n8lk,Shill_Borten,Ultimate tribute
dx7ifhx,Keselo,Zidane did what every footballer who played against Materazzi wanted to do. Absolute cunt of a player.
dx7eajf,thedeliberative,What an end to his CL career
dx7edwf,EmTeeEl,Only himself to blame
dx7ejdw,sandiegosoccer,Very Zidane-esque
dx7ew2e,tapped21,Zidane definitely knows the feeling
dx7fiz1,broohaha,Buffon was on the pitch when it happened to Zidane.
dx7futc,tapped21,And now Zidane was on the sidelines when it happened to Buffon
dx7hek4,moonboots_runner,**COINCIDENCE???**
dx7hic8,sharkaim4,DO NOT MOVE - FBI.
dx83uqx,dankchester_city,man this thread blew my MIND
dx7i2yn,fesamuaramu,Seeing them together on those occasions makes sure that Buffon is not Zidan with a wig.
dx7lcpf,tropafandanga,I knew I couldn't be the only one aware of the resemblance.
dx7i6vx,RasenRendan,It has come full circle 12 years later
dx7holt,JYPark_14,Zidane had a similar exit so he can relate to Buffon's emotions
dx7f800,bagehis,You know those two will meet on a beach somewhere in a decade and laugh about how they both were ejected for losing their heads (no pun intended) at the end of their player careers.
dx7gsw2,HongKongChicken,Yeah I'd say Buffon will crack up at the thought of missing his last chance at a Champions League medal.
dx7lfgj,rayray604,"eh he's won a world cup and couple other major trophies, I feel bad for him but not as much as he has other high points in his career that he can look up to."
dx7ofi9,HongKongChicken,"Yeah I'm not disputing he's had a great career, I just don't really ever imagine him looking back fondly on tonight."
dx7hez5,stcwhirled,> on a YachtFTFY
dx7fze4,coopsquared,"Except Gigi was arguing a call (albeit, too aggressively) while Zidane purposely headbutted another player. I think they're in different categories."
dx7iylo,EddieThunderCloud,"The offense is not the same, the end result is."
dx7elro,RedRoseRing,"Wtf is he doing honestly. Don't shove the ref, that's an auto redEven if he misses they're playing 30 minutes with 10 men"
dx7eojr,soMDef,Emotions can crack even the calmest people
dx7fazt,jelde,Emotions are literally the cause and effect here lol
dx7f1bp,Apolog3ticBoner,"He's Italian, not exactly known to be the calmest of folks"
dx7h0h5,loverd0s3,We have the anthropologist here.
dx7lkan,Compendyum,And 100% never change what just happened.
dx7ftfx,Al_Mondega,Buffon the fascist isn't really the calmest of people.
dx7f1dp,iplattedbloodborne,Easy to say though. Imagine the emotion coming back from 3-0 down and then that happens.
dx7fq63,RedRoseRing,Fair enough
dx7fjfg,Izio17,"[auto red, depends on who you are with Michael Oliver](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/oliver.jpg?w=620&h=396&crop=1)"
dx7fsx4,Kralizek82,"To be honest, the push he got the red card for seemed to be the result of someone pushing him..."
dx7gyn0,zieheuer,">Wtf is he doing honestly. Don't push the ref, that's an auto redthe game was basically over after the penalty decision. might as well just let go of your anger."
dx7fgk9,Prownzor,He should've punched the ref ... and then kicked him when he was on the ground
dx7ho4b,IllicitBehavior,"Well that would have certainly eclipsed Zidane's last game, sure."
dx7ljmv,tropafandanga,"Debatable. Materazzi played a vital role in making it legendary, more than an anonymous ref could."
dx7lfue,Prownzor,Worth it though. What a massive cunt of a referee. I bet he was so tempted to celebrate Ronaldo's goal with him and suck his dick right there or something
dx7gr0u,JMartin_21,I'd react the same way if i'm getting robbed in my last UCL match.
dx7gct9,dahiya27,10 men wasn't impossible task to finish off.
dx7glin,krisburturion,"Well when someone just decides to gift the latest Real Madrid dive with a soft penalty to ruin all your hard work due to incompetence right under your nose, I'd imagine you'd get upset too."
dx7hl53,sharkaim4,That wasn't a dive. Period.
dx7i4ux,krisburturion,I disagree.
dx7exck,kappasquad420,People get away with that all the time GTFO with that shit.
dx7ey65,JediPieman63,"Well not really, if Benatia wasn't an idiot none of this would've started.If I was Buffon I'd be in that refs ear too in the 94th minute of the biggest comeback ever where *you feel* like you've been robbed. He's been passionate from day 1, he will know he's done wrong but I don't blame him at all, heat of the moment stuff."
dx7owgo,PandaXXL,It's Benatia's fault Buffon decided to abuse the ref?
dx8bgcn,JediPieman63,"Please read my comment, I said it was Benatia's fault that it got to that. Then heat of the match stuff and general passion took over. Buffon lost his calm in a game of huge stakes where he thought he was being robbed. He'll know he's wrong later."
dx7emoj,RedGSXR,Seriously. He went fucking mental. Deserved the red.
dx7eyy4,ShadowDandy,I guess you would react calmly right?
dx7f4xn,w3lcome_home,Whether he would react calmly or not is irrelevant. Buffon's behaviour was a red.
dx7fx5s,ShadowDandy,"Anyone would react like that, the ref must know there is a human in front of him, a penalty is already harsh enough, for me was a yellow **at best**"
dx7g1pr,loveicetea,Good thing you're not a ref
dx7kz95,Kaneco_,"Ronaldo got a Red and a 5 match ban for a single small shove on the ref on the Super Cup earlier this season. You just don't touch the ref like that, ever."
dx7fo0x,PyreDruid,I might not. But then I'd deserve a red too.
dx7fjq7,deathbladev,His 10 other teammates didn't act like absolute idiots.
dx7fzih,ShadowDandy,"Watch the replay, all reacted the same, but only red to the GK, not even for the player making the foul"
dx7g0ys,ta84351,because buffon pushed him. definite red
dx7gia3,deathbladev,Buffon went more mental than anyone else.
dx7wv2r,ShadowDandy,"Pretty much not, al reacted the same, but he was the GK not the rest"
dx7enzu,sweetwattah,"I know it's easy to say right now, but he really should have kept his head and calmed down"
dx7fqtt,Jawadd12,"This kind of behaviour is never okay, but for once, I can sympathise with this, this kind of pressure would break anyone. He's near retirement, it's his last chance to win this, if it's a penalty it's almost a given loss."
dx7em2x,Bay_stata,"""Death to Traitors"""
dx7epj2,BumwineBaudelaire,fucking stupid way to go out
dx7ejnf,ZaaltorTheMerciless,You can see mandzukic push into him. I still think it's harsh as fuck on Buffon
dx7emn6,Stujel-mabok,Was Mandzukic also pushing Buffon's face into the ref's?
dx7eug4,BumwineBaudelaire,fuck off if anyone knows how dumb that is it's Buffon he had no reason at all to be anywhere near that ref let alone head butting him
dx7ehgr,aquadamn,"Man this is heartbreaking, this is not Zidane irresponsible, he was right by the call"
dx7egbi,Hyher,Or real that robbed
dx7ej35,Kangdrew,Madrid didnt push the ref
dx7emko,Hyher,"Imagine you are comebacking and the ref does this to you, wouldn't you get mad?"
dx7eqev,DocaHyper,"Yes, and i would probably push the ref. But i would not try to justify it as being someone elses fault. It's my responsibility what ever i do."
dx7h3ar,zieheuer,it's kind of the refs fault for giving joke of a penalty.
dx7euxq,yammertime27,"Still not an excuse to push the ref, that's always a red card, you can't just say ""but he was mad"" as excuse"
dx7erof,gonnacrushit,"does what? Look at the fucking replay, it's a penalty"
dx7erz6,ClungeCreeper321,Gives a debateable penalty against you? Quite crying. You can't push the ref period. Debate the penalty all you like but that's a red
dx7esr7,TheIIArencibia,that doesnt mean the real robbed though. you can be mad without being a dick
dx7fip6,nocturn-e,Give a penalty?
dx7oz9t,PandaXXL,How dare the ref award a clear penalty when Juventus were trying to win the game. Your bias is fucking moronic.
dx87n9e,Hyher,You know what? Just watch the Buffon interview and you'll understand but maybe you can't because you never even played on the field
dx7ejg3,fiif,If he kept his month shut and got on with the game he wouldn't have a red and this game might still be going on. It's on him
dx7eljf,Hyher,yeah because surely he would of got that ball in the top corner
dx7ewu7,fiif,"Probably still goes in that's why I said ""might"". Ronaldo might take it differently vs one of the greatest keepers ever. I still assume Ronaldo ends the game, ie why I used the word ""might"" instead of ""would"""
dx7g2u5,ta84351,butterfly effect though
dx7ey4v,FrcNeru,Yeah we all can see the future.
dx7elra,SergiuIlescu,What about if the referee checked the fucking VAR first before calling a seemingly non-existent penalty?
dx7enom,Mrg220t,"The fuck it's not a penalty. Clear push from the back, you want to blame someone, blame Benatia."
dx7enpy,fahomnom,it was a clear penalty LOL
dx7enl9,eroland420,You are blind if you couldn't see that kick to Lucas' chest from behind
dx7h92o,zieheuer,football isn't a no contact sport. you need way more for a penalty.
dx7eo4o,sm0r3ss,"its clearly a penalty, he pushed him during a clear goal scoring opportunity."
dx7epfv,mv8,"The referee made the right decision, stop being butthurt barça fanboy"
dx7erud,Hyher,oh sorry next time i'll saty quiet just because i'm a barca fan. I can't talk in front of such superior real madrid fans sorry
dx7f15n,mv8,"Do you see my badge? Does it says Real Madrid?You can be salty wherever you want, just dont lie saying it isn't a pen."
dx7f5f2,Hyher,I can also put a Osasuna badge pretending it's my team don't you think? Apart from that today we saw a bit too many attemptss of diving in area from Real
dx7fb49,mv8,"Did the referee call any of the dives? So whats your problem? Its a penalty, get over it."
dx7fj9m,Hyher,If they are that good why aren't they trying to make goals by actually making these cheeky attempts that is what i'm saying and I think the referee could not call that and just see who is the true better team in the extra time
dx7erbc,1Warrior4All,"I really think Juventus deserved to go through but it as a clear penalty. Knee on the back, Benatia played carelessly."
dx7eomg,JackEichel8x10,What about the ball-less ref who wouldn't dare card a Madrid's player? Ronaldo dove so much along with the other Real players but no cards for it. Then the ref does that at the end ahaha. Must be nice being a diva who gets nothing against him
dx7egus,gvstavo,hahahahhahah
dx7ehsz,shkico,Almost headbutted the ref!
dx7ei5r,Subertt,Very Zidanesque
dx7eimm,aveniner,Like Zidane with France
dx7ejj1,canaman18,Zidane-esque way to end it
dx7el91,baymenintown,Very Zidane like.
dx7elvx,backtolurk,Even Iniesta had it way better.
dx7er6z,LeFricadelle,"it's poetic, a bit like with zidane and 2006not to say he deserved it, i wanted juventus to go through"
dx7ecrf,benelchuncho,"He's retired already, just punch him, the suspension won't matter"
dx7eglu,maradonnasplug,I was really hoping Buffon would just Zidane the ref
dx7ekrv,Strobe_Synapse,Zidane would be proud
dx7frzr,Osceana,"Zidane run on the pitch and high five him. ""Ayyyyyyy"" :D"
dx7i8zz,RasenRendan,This comment is gold lmao
dx7ymgd,ShadowDandy,Just to headbutt the ref too
dx7hcez,zieheuer,Even Materazzi would approve of it.
dx7f361,Jonny_Segment,Zidaning the Zidane would have been better.
dx7fjfi,splettnet,Zinception?
dx7na0b,Shill_Borten,And a lot more confusing
dx878bj,meellodi,"Zidane : ""WTF, I don't say anything about your sister"""
dx7fvyg,BrotherSeamus,I love (1) that Zidane is a verb and (2) everybody here instantly knows what it means.
dx7erd6,wisps_of_ardisht,God I'd love to see michael oliver get belted
dx7hh6s,Pajicz,"No wonder English refereeing standards have gone downhill, if one of the best young refs in the nation gets that kind of treatment. Really a thankless job."
dx7fpto,W1llF,You want to see someone get headbutted? You're a cunt
dx7gbmq,wisps_of_ardisht,Not someone... Michael Oliver
dx7ik0x,vdude007,He got headbutted already. By Joe Hart
dx7s2mr,IzkaGruba,I'd personally pay to see Mike Dean get headbutted.
dx7em4j,Growlithe123,We all hoped
dx7gc2j,TonyBolognawithchees,I would shit myself if I saw Buffon do that
dx7fuen,A3xMlp,"Personally I would have preferred for him to Maradona Oliver, just like in that fight against Athetic. Knee to the face, KO."
dx7h4l3,Zauberer-IMDB,[Zidane's reaction if he did that](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ClearGrimGalapagostortoise-size_restricted.gif)
dx7pcxx,GMSB,God imagine the memes
dx7ek84,EricClaptonsDeadSon,"I was hoping he'd headbutt the ref in the chest, personally"
dx7etbl,whyborg,"I honestly think he'd be a hero if the penalty decision was wrong, but it wasn't and I'm glad he didn't tarnish his reputation like that."
dx7fylh,ModeratorsLoveConor,"That's what I was thinking, just give that fucker a nice right hook and walk off, I mean he has gloves that are padded"
dx7g21y,coopsquared,Wanted him to crack Ronaldo so that someone else would've had to take the pen. Might've had a shot then
dx7xtbk,HugoEmbossed,"He's not getting a suspension for punching a ref, he's getting a court date."
dx7frtu,A3xMlp,"Honestly, kudos to him for not doing so. If I was him I would murder Oliver on the spot."
dx7g623,benelchuncho,"Yep, I'd just punch him and leave slowly. My CL career would be over anyway"
dx7gb9b,A3xMlp,I'd do what Maradona did. Grab his head and hit him with the knee. Instant KO.
dx7ejgx,tuttomuscoli90,What a dumb way to look at things.
dx7fx4z,tibetanguywithadog,why? with all that raging emotions in the last minute i won't be surprised if it happened.
dx7hydg,tuttomuscoli90,"I'm being downvoted for saying that he shouldn't punch him because it's his last game? Come on, this is soccer, not MMA. Be professional."
dx7jmbk,EddieThunderCloud,"Sometimes emotions get the best of even the most professional people. Luckily Buffon was able to his cool, albeit a bit too late."
dx7o0no,LuE_fc,My thoughts exactly lmao
dx7raw1,patiperro_v3,"I can understand his anger and frustration, but it was a pen unfortunately. No question in my mind. Benatia didn't even touch the ball..."
dx7eiz8,karreerose,He should've just headbutted penaldo. Would've been the perfect way to go out with Zidane watching.
dx7erwq,ElClashico,"Watch out, don't cut yourself on that edge!"
dx7epz9,Commandophile,salty?
dx7es45,karreerose,You do not deserve to be there. But I'm looking forward to you losing 5:0 to Roma.
dx7fk7t,Gaarando,I wouldn't say they didn't deserve. I mean Real Madrid won 3-0 first leg. And was losing 3-0 the second leg. But it helps that Navas can't catch a simple ball for the 3-0 or not keep a slow header out at the that he was in for the 2-0.. And 1-0 was a defensive mistakes but those happen. With De Gea that would have been a 1-0 game perhaps even 0-0 because De Gea has big saves like that all the time.
dx7eu9j,Commandophile,>You do not deserve to be there.back at ya bby
dx7hv3g,Zack_Fair_,cheating fucks

dx7ejfo,TalkingReckless,the ban could go further to Seria A if he had done that...
dx7enm1,benelchuncho,What does Uefa have to do with Serie A?
dx7ew66,TalkingReckless,"a punch against a Uefa Ref is no little thing, Lega Calcio would probably have to take some action too and so would Juv"
dx7froh,W1llF,He wouldn't play again
dx7exue,michael421389,Are you serious you fucking cunt?
dx7ekpw,Lowelll,"Honestly right call or not, what the fuck is the point of screaming at the ref there? Has therer EVER been a referee in the history of football who whithdrew his decision because a bunch of angry players screamed at him?"
dx7fb0i,Alajarin,"I mean... in those moments you're probably not thinking 100% rationally based on pure, cold logic"

dx7g4r0,tibetanguywithadog,"""why don't people always remain calm and logical like I do?"" - some keyboard warrior"
dx7h9t6,Graspiloot,"You're right. That's why in Basketball, Rugby, every other sport players assaulting the ref for every decision is an equally big issue. Oh wait..."
dx7hzfa,JackGunner93,"Fair, but it's important to remember that none of those sports actually matter"
dx7ir5c,BehelitOutlaw,Arsenal fans always make me laugh. You for another reason. Top joke!
dx7hkjj,Berluscones_For_Sale,well basketball refs get punched instead of yelled at
dx7iaal,guczy,Have you ever heard of Kevin Durant?
dx7k9zp,Jonoabbo,"That's kinda the point though. The one player who does it frequently in Basketball is known for it. Every player, manager and coach does it in Football."
dx7ijsr,worldchrisis,That same guy tilts off and starts cursing out his teammates when he loses at League of Legends.
dx7kgco,throwingawaythetvv,Also goes mad over marginal UI changes on anything he uses. probably.
dx7lvb6,rayray604,"I can kinda see his point but I don't fully agree with him. Tense situations when a controversial call happens are often prevalent in their football careers that they should somewhat be accustomed to those kinds of tense situations. Something that someone else mentioned in this thread is that you don't see this happen in any other sports. I mean sure it happens in some instances but those players (I.E Kevin Durant in the NBA) are known for it. In football its pretty much every player that does it. I played competive in high school and college and I am fully aware of the red blur that happens in these kinds of situation when emotion just takes control, but at the same time since I wasn't a professional player I was not able to control my emotions as well."
dx7murm,,[deleted]
dx7np4r,rayray604,I agree with that. Your last game ever and then that happens. Full emotion overload.
dx7lk86,Trance2000,It's not foolish at all.He's been making history his whole career. He's old and very experienced. We aren't talking about a young goaltender entering his prime. It's Buffon. It was very foolish for him to act the way he did and personally I was very surprised he let his emotions get the better of him.
dx7jafr,virginiadicky,"Nah dude, I've played basketball, soccer, and football and the worst thing I ever did to the ref was shrug and say what the fuck. I personally don't think he should have been red carded, but logic should override reaction at that point. And I say that as a hot head and someone who actually roots for Juve if they aren't playing Real, and would have rooted for them to win it all if they'd won this game."
dx7lxbp,filetauxmoelles,"I was in the same exact situation myself in a state tournament final that we were winning 3-2. I saved a 1v1 but the ref called a penalty on me so I flipped on him and (thankfully) just got a yellow. My only yellow ever. With the adrenaline running in Buffon, there was no way he could've held that rage in"
dx7fb5i,Desikiki,"You would scream too if you were in their place. The stakes are huge and there is a biased sense of injustice. Of course they are not going to just say oh well that's it lads, pack your bags."
dx7fkcn,Nihilokrat,"It's just he way to vent for people. If you believe something was done wrong or you have been wronged and the person you think is accountable for that is within reach, all your frustration and anger will be directed towards him or her. Couple that with adrenalin, etc and there is basically a forgetable chance that someone falls down and punches the grass in disbelief instead of jumping the ref and voicing the disagreement, to put it nicely."
dx7flic,casparbain,"In all fairness if you've ever played a high stakes match like this (obviously we haven't but relative), emotions are incredibly high. I'm disappointed he did it but can't blame him. Retiring, from his angle didn't look that bad, only trophy he really needed still, that's got to be incredibly tough for him and snapping like that is entirely understandable albeit unacceptable."
dx7gjn1,Kaparn_orginalet,1986 barca - ifk. Ref first called goal and changed his mind after guardiola and co screamed at him. IFK would have gone through till the final...
dx7f5gr,kruizerhei,"It's mostly because they think they can get the referee's attitude to change toward the teams as the game proceeds. Most of the times obviously, players believe they are in the right so they want to make their voices heard. It basically affects the referee's upcoming decisions (no matter how marginally). In this case, being such a game changing call, it's a spontaneous reactions and you let your anger out."
dx7flls,MeNoSpeakAmericano,"but this was the last minutes of the overtime, there were no point in showing anger toward the ref."
dx7fpsq,kruizerhei,"Yeah, as I said, players don't usually hold their emotions in such a moment"
dx7ffuw,thedudeabides10188,after ronaldo dived all game and in the last minute to give a call like that ...i wouldve murdered the ref
dx7hdu6,gazeebo,"And diving all game got no cards just so that he could strip naked in the last second. On the other hand, Juve got yellows left and right. The Douglas Costa one was well deserved but Ronaldo dropped dead like four times."
dx7fx7w,JMarduk,"2 weeks ago in Mexico, actually"
dx7fxso,Arth_,"[Actually, yes.](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/nov/27/theknowledge.sport)"

dx7fk79,WhiskeySeven,"You think competitive players are thinking clearly in a moment like that? Thanks for your input though brain genius, really appreciate it."
dx7gvcd,sammy_kuffour,Have you ever been at an exciting football game or even watched one on TV? How could you not scream in such a situation? It might not be clever but it is only human.
dx7f8ng,CapsFree2,I'd like to see that for experience.
dx7fd3u,sosolastreethehe,"It's just the heat of the moment, they know it won't change anything but you just can't help it. Especially on that occasion, they probably wanted to actually kill him, I really thought someone was gonna get punched"
dx7foi9,firechaox,"Probably passion at the end there, which is understandable a bit. Although it doesn't justify it."
dx7hvdd,Kherlimandos,I've never seen a case like that.
dx7i73m,Eladir,Never. It's only happened in joke competitions like the greek league.
dx7jr9a,shordilele,"Yeah, thats what Buffon is trying to make him do..."
dx7pi9g,khthon,"Those are the minor leagues still in him. I watch a few 2^nd league games and it's not uncommon to have a ref change his ""heart"" out of fear that is. Also, peer pressure. Idling by is not kindly seen in the locker room."
dx7un5c,LarsP,"Yeah, but keep in mind that it's hard for young players to keep their emotions in...never mind..."
dx7fo5n,Korrk,I wish behavior against the refs was treated the same way as in the NFL. Football players have zero respect for the referees.
dx7egdh,Fishcork,"as much as i love buffon and as much as I wanted buffon to go on to the semi-finals, what he did was pretty unacceptable and deserved the red"
dx7fcaa,mythoilogicalman,He definitely saw red.
dx7i9mh,dabbo93,Everyday I love him just a little bit more
dx7g2lh,kingofthefourth,"Mm, colour of the card"
dx7fmj6,Gaarando,"I wouldn't say it was unacceptable. He deserved a red but come on, we would all be mad in that situation."
dx7i6lt,oF3r0x,It was for sure unacceptable but also very understandable imo
dx7ek56,Stujel-mabok,"I don't feel bad for him at all, with all his experience he should know how to control his temper."
dx7etq0,MrKearns,Plus he's a fascist. Makes it all the more hilarious that all the Guardian-reading football hipsters fawn over him
dx7gb6y,Let-Me-Hear,"Are you for real?Really hope that you're ironic, but that would still be really bad to say.Just wash up your mouth, and think before talking."
dx7gf4t,MrKearns,"Yes, but I will be downvoted for an unpopular fact, just like Oliver is being slammed for making a correct (but unpopular) decision"
dx7gpwl,Let-Me-Hear,"It's not called unpopular fact, it's called misinformation."
dx7ekzn,Ryan8Ross,Pen was soft but buffon definitely deserved the redWhat's more is no keeper in th world would've saved that pen so didn't matter too much
dx7ezcj,Crurple,Are you a robot? Step into his shoes and try and contain your emotions. He yelled I don't get wtf he could've said to get a red.
dx7ftev,FireStarzz,"replay is out now, go find it, he pushed the red in his faceI aint no Real fan at all, but as a neutral, the pen and the red is the right call, ref handled the pressure very well"
dx7gyv4,Crurple,Fair. Seeing the replay I can't argue the red but I still think there's few men who would be able to keep there emotions in check in the same circumstances.
dx7g6af,Ryan8Ross,Being emotional doesn't excuse you from the laws of the game? He pushed the ref in the back and probably also screamed profanities in his face6 minutes later ronaldo took off his shirt to celebrate after one of the most emotional penalties he's ever scored and still (rightfully) got booked
dx7f99p,UhPhrasing,he pushed Oliver
dx7gcla,UneasyInsider,Can't lay your hands on a ref.
dx7f0nk,senorfresco,Should have headbutted Zidane before walking off.
dx7fpup,sneakersbythesea_,"Nobody forced him to charge, abuse and manhandle the ref. You can blame the penalty on whomever you want, but Buffon is squarely responsible for his own red card. He has the most amount of experience on the pitch. He should have known better."
dx7eh34,Leetfox5,"Him and Zidane. Same caliber, and they sadly went out almost the same way"
dx7eml7,shsourov,the zidane way to go .
dx7fopm,boi1da1296,"There's a split second where you can see the red card register on his face, and that look was just heartbreaking."
dx7gaoc,TheMediumPanda,"His own fault here, 100%. Looked like a madman, screaming into the ref's face like that."
dx7gl8m,bryoda,I expected him to zidane the referee.
dx7emhl,Jeffy29,"Even if you were cheering Real, it fucking sucks that the game ended like this. Like some fucking greek tragedy."
dx7gdy0,NIGHTxWOLF7,"Can confirm, not the proudest of wins(agg) but we are in the semis and it's all that matters now."
dx7ep4e,1Warrior4All,reminded me of Zidane in WC2006 :(
dx7erxt,Woodstovia,https://i.imgur.com/sFqJXZH.png?1
dx7f319,HailHelix123,It's his fault tho
dx7hd88,ynwa-lfc,"Honest question: do you think that Buffon got himself intentionally sent off because Szczęsny is a better penalty stopper, or did he just completely lose the plot?"
dx7ir7l,__milan227,Why though?
dx7j4g6,tchollinginthedeep,Nah
dx8k533,321cmg,"As an Arsenal fan who has been fucked over by Michael Oliver's incompetence and perverse desire to make the game about him more than once, I feel so fucking bad for Buffon. His last Champions league and everything...Michael Oliver is a toad, and I'm really happy that we won't have to deal with him this summer at the WC."
dx7ect8,shrewdy,:( He of all players doesn't deserve to bow out on that note
dx7el2b,legendcr7,The greatest always do that. See Zidane.
dx7erqn,PukeRainbowss,Fuck me I can't wait to see who Ronaldo is going to murder on the pitch in that case
dx7g2dx,robotnique,...oh god he's going to settle the argument permanently by killing Leo.
dx7emo8,OptimysticWanderer,Oh Buffon...what a cunt you are
dx7ejn1,madcap9,Completely deserved the red though. Just his rage boiling over.
dx7ejve,Prownzor,He should have punched that fucking cunt of a referee right in the balls
dx7er63,MrKearns,Violence is the correct response to a referee making a correct decision.
dx7hj44,zieheuer,">Violence is the correct response to a referee making a correct decision. no, but the wrong decision, like in this case."
dx7ht5u,MrKearns,all the video evidence and non-biased consensus seems to be stacked against you. Why do you think it's the wrong decision?
dx7f7mx,Prownzor,Correct in what world?? No fucking way that's a penalty. If it is then this is a sport for fucking pussies
dx7h38w,prawntheman,"Maybe it is beyond your mental capacity to be understanding rules, but you are wrong."
dx7hlag,zieheuer,you would have 50 penalties per game if this kind of contact is enough.
dx7hpf6,prawntheman,So a shove in the back just as the striker is about to shoot at point blank range PLUS a kick across his chest is perfectly legal? I wasn't aware that we were watching MMA.
dx7hvkr,MrKearns,"no you wouldn't, because usually players aren't dumb or desperate enough to make this kind of contact in the box. I don't know what kind of games you've been watching."
dx7fh9p,xhen0,clear pen xD
dx7gcgw,MrKearns,/r/guns /r/hamburgers /r/incest /r/the_donald here I found some subs that might be more up your alley
dx7e8cv,Vladimir_Putins_Cock,This kills the Gigi
dx7f30n,DorothyJMan,He just wanted to end with a clean sheet
dx7ghuq,Arrown,When you put it that way...
dx85m1f,tklfillerz,"Buffon playing 4D chess just so he could end up with a clean sheet, damn"
dx7g92e,ActionWaction,"Technically he did, just his team didn't"
dx7hov1,brian_d3p0,That's what he said
dx7gh5l,GoonerAlej,apology for poor englishwhen were u when boofon dies?
dx7f2jf,zshaan6493,Where were you when Gigi was killI was at work watching Football on my work computer.
dx7hzjr,Zack_Fair_,it kills the country. Except Milan which is apparently more cunty than anticipated
dx7ipli,Theart_of_the_cards,"Dont except your rivals to have sympathy for you for getting eliminated from the CL, lol"
dx7f2pj,Woodstovia,https://i.imgur.com/sFqJXZH.png?1
dx7eh0v,fortytwoEA,So sad :(
dx7gb2y,prowantedz,"There is no way the World Cup will be as exciting as this year's champions league,"
dx7htht,cord1408,Yes. No netherlands or Italy either.
dx7jp04,LameAttendant,Nor Chile.
dx7now0,icec0o1,"Or USA. Oh wait, that probably makes it better."
dxbi0if,the_james_howlett,"nooooooooo, at least not for me living here in the USA. As it is soccer is barely growing here! this would have helped alot, i remember during the last world cup and actually seeing usa fans filling up bars and stuff, now with no usa in, the momentum stopped, Hopefully it still keeps growing"
dx805k3,cord1408,"Aye, missed these guys."
dx7mcg8,Dion14,"Thanks for thinking about us mate, will absolutely be cheering for England. They have a nice squad (on paper) hope they can finally make it come true on a final tournament for once"
dx7thma,johnny_riko,I think we will struggle to get out of the group stages and will then lose in the first knockout round.
dx971i9,Dion14,Sooo basically every tournament?
dx804ix,cord1408,"Haha, as an indian there's no team to support. The dutch have been my favorites. and the english were our colonial overlords so they can just sod off! /s"
dx8554y,cslifebih,Yet you support an English Club
dx85sfc,Rasta_Jack,Yeah but like the least English English club.
dx9cyn6,cake_flattener1,">Thanks for thinking about us mate, will absolutely be cheering for England.Oh God, why would you put yourself through that?We'll be boring as hell and go out to the first decent team we play in the knockouts. If you're lucky we'll put on one good game against Belgium in order to squeak through the group stage after losing to Tunisia or Panama."
dx7wm0k,riskyrofl,Would this Netherlands team really be that exciting?
dx7zxey,cord1408,Touché. They've just been a favorite of mine.
dx7onch,chihawks,No Italy is mind boggling. Also no USA is depression. But there are some new faces too.
dx7r3f5,I_bidoofd,"True about those new faces, but it is depressing isn't It? Alot of big countries taking a back sit this year. Got to take a genealogy test soon just to see who I should root for. Hopefully I got some Swedish, maybe even some Polish in me somewhere lol"
dx7rs2v,chihawks,Yeah I'm Irish/British/Serbian mostly. Then the rest is a mix with some Italian. I cheer for those three then just Italy because i love Italy as a country.
dx8brzf,CarloPlaya,"You are American, then."
dx8dpqo,KingAztek,*US-American
dx8s3dc,chihawks,Talking about who to cheer for though. My parents were immigrants.
dx98wu8,I_bidoofd,"Exactly, no US to root for, ma's from Norway and pops from Czechia. Neither of them are in. Feels like i cant cheer on nobody unless I find out one of my ancestors at least lived close to a border lol"
dx9s8dn,chihawks,Well I guess americans are not allowed to do that. We must only like the u.s. /s
dx9veqr,I_bidoofd,"Screw it, I'm rooting for South Korea. Its kinda like America, but in Asia! lmao XD, I kid, I kid lol"
dx7reqa,nikmav2,How is that anything but positive?
dx7pdag,Alexkono,Don't forget the USA! ^/s Source: Am American
dx7p1mj,churrosricos,Cause they are trash and honestly didnt deserve to be there
dx7mifr,LOLThatHilarious,8-1?
dx8abmk,neon_noire,Lol. You don't actually believe that do you?
dx7e8vo,pow360,"What a shitty way for Juventus to get knocked out. Unreal game. Edit: I'm not saying it wasn't a pen. It sure was to me, but still it was just an all intense game."
dx7ff9i,chemcrimp,Pen all day.
dx7fpkm,pow360,"For sure, I'm not denying it."
dx7fq3w,YesNoIDKtbh,"Yeah, correct decision but still undeserved result imo."
dx7gpew,,[deleted]
dx7hw5b,Theart_of_the_cards,We also missed so many chances
dx7hyb7,MyNameIsSushi,"Undeserved how? The better team won, otherwise they wouldn‘t have won."
dx7i3jb,YesNoIDKtbh,Only if everyone agrees with the presumption that the better team always wins. I know I don't.
dx7iffx,MyNameIsSushi,In what situation would the worse team win?
dx7il89,YesNoIDKtbh,"Could be any number of reasons. Bad luck or bad ref calls are the most obvious ones. Also if someone cheats their way to victory, but that sort of goes under bad ref calls I guess. The point is it's not that straight-forward. Although a lot of people would agree with your presumption, a lot of people would disagree as well."
dx7n510,jordank94,It was bad luck when navas got scored on by matudi
dx7j9ps,MyNameIsSushi,"Fair enough. An unbiased ref would probably make equal amount of mistakes for either team though so it kind of equalizes itself. If the ref is biased or straight up bad then yeah, the worse team can win. Bad luck is not a reason imo. Bad luck is always tied to a team‘s mistake if you ask me. If the defender makes a mistake and I get 'lucky' then that‘s because the defender played worse than me and made a mistake."
dx7joxz,YesNoIDKtbh,> Bad luck is not a reason imo. Bad luck is always tied to a team‘s mistake if you ask me.A certain beach ball would like to have a word.
dx7knum,carpesdiems,but one defender does not account for an entire team being 'worse'. This is a very single minded argument you're trying to make
dx7kokm,Alter_Mann,Equal amount of mistakes yea. But a soccer game is not going on for ages and in 90 minutes it's really easily possible to make two or three favorable calls to the same team that decide a game
dx7l23d,MyNameIsSushi,"As I said, the better team *can* lose but it doesn‘t happen as often as the opposite. Anyone who thinks that is delusional. The better team usually wins."
dx7njj4,Alter_Mann,Ofc usually. Nobody says the opposite :D
dx7oaa7,Auguschm,"Dude if someone wins because they mad an outside shot and for some miracle of God it went in while the other team shot like a million times but the ball refused to go in the better team lost in that scenario. The better team loses all the time. There hundreds of examples, hell thousands. A really obvious one and I'm just remembering it because it's really famous it's Brasil vs Argentina in the 1990 world championship. Watch that game and tell me Argentina was better. (I am argentinian by the way)"
dx7onbb,MyNameIsSushi,"But that‘s the thing. A ball doesn‘t refuse to go in, we can‘t just anthropomorphize the damn ball. If a team isn‘t able to get the ball inside the goal they‘re definitely not the better team, no matter how many times they try. Quite the opposite, 50 shots and 1 goal is way less efficient than 10 shots and 1 goal. People think that the more ball possession and shots a team has the better they are. That‘s not the case *in my opinion*. The goal of the game is to score more goals than the enemy team."
dx7klqz,carpesdiems,are you really this stupid? Juve played better as a team over the 90 minutes and scored 3 goals at the bernabeu. One juve player lost his cool and cost them the game. Not sure how that means the 'better' team won.
dx7ky49,MyNameIsSushi,"You do realise that they‘ve played once before and RM took the game 3-0, right? 4 goals > 3 goals."
dx7lsb2,Trance2000,Navas making a bad error is Juve playing better?What are you smoking?
dx7n71f,jordank94,Navas made a mistake also...real Madrid didn't let juve score at HOME
dx7ojy3,Asif2k36,"Please stop. Don't make excuses that Navas made a mistake. That doesn't put aside the fact that Juventus still got 3 goals in the Bernabeu from a 0-3 deficit. Just because a goalkeeper makes a mistake doesn't mean that Juve wasn't ""allowed"" to score."
dx7wslm,jordank94,Real Madrid controlled the last 30 minutes of the game and controlled the whole first game120 > 60 m8
dx7kk20,Alter_Mann,"All German Sky experts were saying it was too less. Think so, too. In full speed it looks like a pen but in slowmotion you can see him going down when there's next to no contact. Not impossible to call a pen but what a time to call a pen. Really poor imo."
dx7f7jl,HailHelix123,It really isn'tThey were about to concede a last minute goal then they just fouled instead
dx7feix,pow360,"The penalty call was correct. But it's still a pretty shitty way to go out. A penalty in the last minute after a crazy 3 goal comeback, insane! Buffon with the red just adds to it also."
dx8gwgb,29Martin92,"No it wasn't, in italy we have the VAR, it simply happened that with a front replay u can see that Benatia hit the ball, that's what this comunity calls a penalty."
dx7hr3r,shoutouttoallmypearz,If I was a Juventus defender I'd much rather take the chances letting Lucas with so much pressure on him getting a tap in instead of Ronaldo getting a penalty
dx7fghq,VinceJumpmanCarter,"Not really. Vazquez didn't go for the header, he was trying to control the ball in the six yard box with two players closing in on him fast"
dx7lvvg,Trance2000,He could've also been trying to hit it with his foot.We shall never know.
dx7f1hw,xapata,Or very Real.
dx7ggx5,Tit_city,"Let's hope for a Liverpool and Roma final. These big teams can fuck off. Roma and Liverpool have insanely passionate fans so the atmosphere would be AMAZING. Could potentially be one of the best finals ever. Plus, Love Messi and Ronaldo, but just so sick of all these fuckin fan boys. I want none of them winning it. Just want an amazing final for one the best UCL's ever."
dx7olj2,chihawks,Yeah that fucking blows for them. Not a bad call though.
dx7x6r5,Nathanman21,It says 3-0 juv? What
dx7ikyg,estoxzero,"It wasn't a pen, it was too soft and the real Madrid player touched the ball with the hand"
dx7e91z,InfernoTacticsHD,What a pen
dx7g3g2,prodigalkal7,"All events aside, that was such a freaking crazy good penalty. Especially with all the pressure, and all those Juve players around Ronalfo before the penalty, all just chirping him and trying to throw him off.And after all that he puts it in a way that no GK could ever stop. That's pretty great"
dx7hedf,peri86,https://e00-marca.uecdn.es/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2018/04/11/15234810830379.jpg
dx7utpi,PastryDish,What are you trying to say? I don't understand. You think it was a dive or he went down too easy?
dx8f7nz,YOLANDILUV,"sure it was a dive. professional football is literally unwatchable if you care for competitive integrity on this level - the better team got kicked out in this particular match, because the referee was unprofessional enough. furthermore he was overwhelmed in this situation. This was my last CL season until video ref gets in place."
dx8krb1,nitro1122,Lul
dx8lib5,YOLANDILUV,Lel
dx7gdwe,aquadamn,That was a perfect layoff to Vazquez too.
dx7ho05,ProperProfessional,"I would've probably shit my pants, skyrocketed it over the net and then remain in the fetal position for the rest of the game."
dx7h8xu,,[deleted]
dx7qswb,solarandlunar,That hand that shouldn't have been there in the first place? That hand?
dx7thff,The_Big_Lebaneski,And then the leg in the armpit?
dx7e8p4,Tsenta,wtf just happened
dx7f0ha,Rmonte90,Madrid won 4-3 on aggregate bro. Enjoy the semi finals
dx7gbbo,prodigalkal7,"Last second penalty by Ronaldo, straight red for Gigi"
dx7e9il,deviceismybae,BENATIA YOU ABSOLUTE FUCKING MORON
dx7eqop,InfernoZeus,Chiellini is more at fault in my opinion. He rushes out of the box leaving the space open for Ronaldo to knock the ball down into.
dx7gq1w,TetraDax,How is Chiellini at fault for Benatia deciding a chestkick seems like a good idea in the 96th minute?
dx7gyfv,InfernoZeus,The mistake has obviously already been made at that point. You don't defend by tackling from behind inside your own 6 yard box.
dx7spgv,ballhawk13,I would disagree with you here as that's exactly what thousands of people have been saying he should have gotten away with it for some stupid reason.
dx7h2yg,TetraDax,"Well you neither defend by kicking someone in the chest - Intentional or not, that move was incredibly stupid"
dx7hgdd,InfernoZeus,It was a certain goal otherwise.
dx7hkal,TetraDax,"Wouldn't agree tbh, Buffon was in a good position to save it."
dx7lz4t,Trance2000,They took the gamble and lost.
dx7m1xj,Wutzer,"Maybe but not every ref would have given the penalty and there was a chance to play the ball, his foot was just 10cm to high. It was a risky challenge but also a good opportunity to score."
dx7n6dj,syn506,People are questioning it being a penalty in here lmao
dx7o6ru,ChaosRaiden,Shouldn't have put him in that position
dx7ks6e,Commandophile,Lucas was likely scoring otherwise.
dx7r9pg,rsyay,What could Benatia honestly do? it was either that or let him shoot.
dx7rc3l,cynicalvanilla,Benatia has to do something there. Can't allow the free strike on goal from that close.He isn't trying to give the pen but it's almost safer to concede the penalty because the conversion rate from that close is higher than kicks from the spot.
dx8957q,skunkrider,"Funny how a chestkick makes the player tumble forward.Worst penalty decision of the week.I have seen two angles now and in neither of them does Benatias body even touch the attacker, except for maybe the leg.I am appauled."
dx8hycs,zaedaus,Thats because benatia shove lucas before launching mma kick
dx7im4g,estoxzero,It was the referee's fault
dx7fka1,clownonanerd,Watching it again Matuidi seemed to lose Lucas
dx7gu14,ppanthero,Sandro was standing too deep.
dx83yzo,fiercygoat,"Absolutely, Sandro is definitely at fault here. He should have played the offside trap just like Matuidi and Chielini did. Instead, he decided to go on an aerial battle with Ronaldo. Huge mistake..."
dx8ki93,krylosz,Playing for an offside in the 93 minute is probably not the smartest play.
dx7gee9,dohhhnut,That jump from ronaldo though
dx7rszx,KamiNoTsurugi,Are we still surprised when Ronaldo gravitates towards his home planet?
dx7eyc2,hadesflames,He doesn't do that and it's a goal anyway.
dx7fpzd,prodigalkal7,"Eh, I don't think so. Vazquez was really close to Buffon. Gigi could've had a chance to do a lot against him, although it was a poke away from being in.Especially with this year's CL, it's tough to say anything is a certainty so, that's why I argue against that."
dx82kj8,youngmufasa93,"It went from a 1 on 1 with the goalie to a 1 on 1 with the goalie, what is there to argue?"
dx7g8ia,portomerf,"I don't think so. Lucas didn't head it first time because it was an awkward height, a bit too low for him. I think he was going to chest it down, which might have given Buffon enough time rush him and make the save had Benatia not made the foul."
dx7g8sp,TandBusquets,Vázquez isn't exactly a prolific scorer.
dx7kdq5,Nerf_Herder2,He would have had to muff it bad. Id say the chances of missing would have been somewhat similar to having a pen saved.
dx7lwfk,TandBusquets,"Did you see how he played the ball? He tried to bring it down with his chest, could've had many things go wrong there. Benatia came in too recklessly, it's a soft pen but benatia pretty much served it up on a platter"
dx7lxcp,xosellc,"Maybe if he takes it with his head, But Vázquez looked like he was trying to chest it down"
dx7mdos,Pat1818,He was going for the chest control over putting it in with his first touch before the foul happened. I would bet Buffon was gonna close him down although he very well still had a chance to finish. I would say the odds of him finishing it after the chest control is a lot lower then Ronaldo converting that pen so I would say he jumped the gun on that and kinda fucked up.
dx7slk1,thesakeofglory,"That's certainly how it seemed to Beniata and he had to react instantly so I don't fault him one bit. We have the benefit of multiple angles and slow mo so we can see Buffon was actually in a great spot to make a save and Vasquez would've actually had a tough shot. Still though, you're probably right and it's at best a 40/60 chance for Buffon."
dx7evzb,brokenbadlab,What's he supposed to do!?
dx7iokw,worldchrisis,Not run through the back of the attacking player in the box? Once he's past you with the ball you have to try to go around him and give your goalkeeper a chance.
dx7n57p,brokenbadlab,If he doesn't make contact there I'd say that's probably put in the back of the net. He's at point blank range. Anywhere but straight at the keeper is a goal. It was a great headed pass too. Still I'm conflicted. Never a good idea to concede a penalty. I think swinging his left leg around front was what really doomed him. Might have gotten away with it if he hadn't done that.
dx7zuhz,necrosteve028,"If he had gone round him, by the time Vazquez gets it to ground to shoot, you could get a block in but that of course means he'd get a shot off which could go anywhere. So yeah what can you do."
dx7epb1,ImSuperManly,What else could he done?
dx7esrk,Jaedco,Track the man
dx7f8rs,ElTibbler,Wasn't his man to track.
dx7gdly,WhatWhatHunchHunch,Oh I guess then just stand there and do nothing.
dx7gos5,ElTibbler,Who said that?
dx7fdg1,TikkaMezzala,"Chiellini stepped out, it was his fault"
dx7g4iw,ta84351,not try to go through the back of him
dx7eqp2,raul777him,Really though? Maybe Lucas would have still scored if he didn't run him over
dx7fuib,Radslide,"Yeah, the only options he had was to run Lucas down and concede a pen or try to cover the goal."
dx7fioc,VinceJumpmanCarter,Not too sure about that. He didn't go for the header and his finishing isn't a strong suit of his
dx7fz38,maverick1905,"From 2 fucking meters, even I could have buried it into the net."
dx7gb9z,VinceJumpmanCarter,"His touch was really poor, wouldn't surprise me if Buffon would've gotten to it first or saved it"
dx7h8ll,maxelnot,the ball didn't even get to him tho. Benatia ran him down before the ball reached
dx7g2wn,ModeratorsLoveConor,"Agree, he was kind of falling over looking for that pentaly, Benitia still went a little to hard."
dx8dyop,Durban-Poison-10,Lol Benatia didn't go in slightly too hard. He outweighs Lucas by a ton and clattered him before he could touch the ball.
dx7f8fn,morbuskid,More like lightly brush him. Vazquez clearly tried to fall as soon as he felt any contact.
dx7fanh,raul777him,"https://i.imgur.com/Z2cHixJ.jpgOk buddy, look at Benatia ready to push him"
dx7fp61,morbuskid,"Still images are misleading, he immediately takes his hands off of him and his momentum didn't stop at all as he flies past him."
dx7fvjm,raul777him,Good thing their is a video that shows how Benatia knocked him over
dx89ggc,skunkrider,Can you take your Real-glasses off now?
dx7fdok,ExpectTheUnexpected,He pushed him with both hands and kicked him in the chest. Does he have to go and murder his family for you to admit it's a penalty?
dx7g8qs,RamboLeon,"Maybe its a Penalty when he goes down After the Contact, but not before."
dx7fp6h,Calciumee,Or maybe used his head!Can't deny he started to go down before ‘being run over'.
dx7mj6b,Wizou,"This. Everyone's asking what else he could have done? NOTHING. Just stand there and let Buffon do his work. 9/10 times you touch Vasquez, it's a penalty. Letting him attempt the volley right in front of Buffon? I'll take those odds over a Ronaldo penalty any day. And it's totally hindsight, but Vasquez first touch was an absurd chest trap?? Buffon would have definitely saved that!"
dx7fpiw,raff97,What could he have done? Far far more blame should go on Alex Sandro for being about 5 metres out of line with the rest of the defence and playing ronaldo onside
dx7f0k5,The-Disco-Phoenix,If the ball had been on the ground I wouldn't blame him but the way it bounced that *could* have been a tough finish for Vasquez
dx7g4pl,maverick1905,He was 2 metres away from an exposed goal. You put it down with your chest and volley it into the net with as much power as you can. I think that's what he's about to do before Benatia WWE'd him.
dx7fwhv,Shane_Z,"I watched the replay several times. The problem is Chiellini and Matuidi stepped out of the box almost the same time just right before Tony Kroos passed it to Ronaldo. It is reasonable that Matuidi needs to defend the outside of the box cuz Kovacic is there but absolutely no point for Chiellini to step out. 100% Chiellini's fault, Benatia is just the one who had to gamble"
dx7ixp2,cabaretcabaret,A last ditch challenge like that means the mistake's already been made
dx7ez6b,Ohnehoffnung,Thank God we got rid of him. But it's crazy how many former bayern players are on Juve.
dx7fv7z,LaPaz_o_Sucre,I think he could have made that challenge without the blatant 2 handed push. Could have just nudged into him with his body and try to put him off as much as he can that way; ref also would be less likely to call the penalty in the final minute with him doing that rather than overtly using 2 hands
dx8droa,distilledwill,"I think thats a certain goal unless Benatia gets back to defend it - and he's already behind the attacker.I mean you might call him a moron for being out of position, and putting himself in a position where that kind of tackle is the last resort."
dx8glu6,Final00Exit,"Not only Benatia's fault. Defense was awful during that action. They were basically standing still, waiting for nothing but the referee to end the match and go to overtimes."
dx7eu99,ZaaltorTheMerciless,We was definitely scoring that had he not fouled him though.
dx7ensi,aquadamn,is it actually a pen though? I'm not sureThe Juve team trying to get into Ronaldo's head was interesting
dx7exz0,deviceismybae,"It doesn't matter, you don't panic like that in such a crucial situation. He already made 2 boneheaded fouls a minute earlier. Who's to say Lucas would have scored? He didn't even catch the ball properly, chances are Buffon rushes out and grabs/deflects it."
dx7exj6,andaru01,In realtime from where the ref is it looks like a proper shove. Slow mo from behind the goal not so much
dx7es1j,Yellowlimes,it is a pen
dx7eub3,irishperson1,How wasn't it?
dx7gh26,aquadamn,"I'm not saying it isn't, I couldn't see the alternate angles :/"
dx7espn,EArobbedme,how the fuck is that a pen so fucking soft
dx7f164,Fromgre,Kick to the chest?
dx7fh4q,sosolastreethehe,"It's the push that makes it a penalty, not the kick, the kick looked pretty soft"
dx7fijc,Fromgre,It's a foul anywhere on the field.
dx7fb0f,EArobbedme,please tell me your joking go watch tennis if you can't handle contact sports

dx7fqgh,NoSoyTuPotato,"Benatia is innocent, clearly going for a leap frog (which is a legal play btw) and Luis didn't cooperate and dove instead.^^^^^^^^^^/s"
dx7f0z7,lore473,"Yeah I agree, Buffon was amazing all game, Vasquez was in a kinda awkward pose to score that, I think either Buffon would save it or Vasquez would fluff it.Weird that Benatia didn't get a red card too, he was really pushing it with the fouls."
dx7gqcl,krisburturion,"It was Vazquez's fault, he's the one who dived. They had been doing it all game, he was just the one who was successful."
dx7geaa,matte12567,"Referee was the moron, and Vazques for a clear dive"
dx7fkw2,AleDelPiero10,"I'm sorry but I don't think that should have been called. I'll take the downvotes or whatever else you can throw at me, but for fucks sake you can't call that. He went down WAY too easily, his touch was fucking shit and had no chance of playing that ball. Fuck everything"
dx7mcbz,Trance2000,Delusional.
dx7fw1g,TheElite3740,Wasn't a penalty
dx7et8t,outsideop,"My thinking also. He didn't realize the attacker in front of him, whoever it was, was always looking for a soft pen. Had he left him alone he would've just fallen over without contact."
dx7fgxn,MrNoMoney10,Vasquez didn't even know that there was anybody on his back
dx7fjim,raff97,So you wanted him to watch and do nothing as vasquez chests it down about 6 metres from his goal? Dont be stupid
dx7eed4,Kriskobg,Pressure of the world on you? Smash it top corner
dx7fgx2,autslash,"Insane composure on the guy. He deserves all the praise he gets. To think some people call that ""just a penalty"" or ""penaldo"" is beyond me."
dx7gbbn,cokecaine,I find it hilarious how he botches penalties when there's absolutely no pressure but always nails it in when it's all on him.
dx7j7kn,autslash,I was thinking how he can be so calm at such an important moment in the game.. then i remembered this guy had so many of those moments already in his career.. for most other players this would have been the most important goal of their career. For Ronaldo its just another wednesday night.
dx7jnyo,cokecaine,"Shit started way back under Ferguson. It's his best quality imho, as much as I don't like him for his overinflated ego."
dx7wj41,xapata,"Overinflated? Ronaldo's ego matches his skill. If he were humble, he might get nervous in these situations."
dx7rlb2,BadMofoYaKnow,"ehh just don't think about it, then smash it"
dx7y33s,not_old_redditor,"Yeah that was taken like a fuckin pro, I've gotta admit."

dx8hvc2,pow_ext,Benatia touch the ball and Lucas dives
dx7ewxj,LordDragon_,"I'm broken. Pen was correct decision. Buffon's last chance to win it, everything was going our way, can't blame him for cracking."
dx7oe93,Marco-Green,"It's amazing for me to see rational and unbiased Juve fans like you saying this, after seeing a poll in Marca.com in which 45% people thinks it wasn't a penalty. Spanish football fans are completely braindead sometimes."
dx8gmlk,LordDragon_,"Still think it was a penalty, benatia has his hands on his back. But even if you think it's the softest penalty in the world, it's our mistake that let them into that position. Doesn't make it any less painful though."
dx8q6pq,Pippelitraktori,"Well its understandable. Most of people are quite dumb and very emotionally invested in football, which is not a good combination"
dx7fnhw,_ae_,"i feel for juve quite a bit. My favourite italian team, even against ronaldo, who, as a portuguse, i cheer for. The emotions on buffon felt heartbreaking. Good luck on the rest of your season."
dx7iax1,LordDragon_,"Thanks, and you."
dx7fx1k,dezmodez,He'll get a chance to win the MLS All-Star game though. That would be a nice way to tie-off a career...

dx7emf9,46_and_2,This was not what was advertised.

dx7g4xr,prodigalkal7,"Funny how yesterday, everyone apart from Barca were cheering how they love football.."
dx7gfgf,rbddit,Gotta go for the underdogs
dx7gi3n,prodigalkal7,"Right, but because the underdogs did it yesterday, but not today, that makes the sport sucky, or people hating it (even if it's momentary)? We all gotta admit that the CL this year is just crazy, even this series between Juve and RN, despite how it ended"
dx7gmfk,rbddit,Yeah I don't actually hate football now it's sort of a joke...

dx7f8by,assassinadam41,Man sad ending but clear penalty though
dx7fd4d,wiseraccoon,Lol so melodramatic. Shut the hell up
dx7eq8r,rbddit,It's not a contact sport anymore
dx7ewio,vodkaflavorednoodles,"Well, watch the other game, Sevilla think it's UFC."
dx7f0kj,rbddit,Sounds entertaining
dx7fgh7,CalimeroX,Not for Lewandowski
dx7fhg2,stragen595,Depends. Not on the receiving side.
dx7g47l,Dead_Knight07,"Sounds Interesting, Do you have some clips?"
dx7hrlz,vodkaflavorednoodles,"https://streamable.com/bmxot that was in extra time with no chance in hell for them to go through. Looked a lot worse in real time. Sadly there is no footage from the ensuing fight, reportedly Wagner punched him in the face for that, and ribery, never one to miss a fight, came from the bench to get involved. They did shit like this the whole game with Bayern not really retaliating until the finak minutes, nzonzi should have gotten three yellow cards. They even fouled ulreich twice very hard with no cards given both times. Also the first yellow would have been a red already if it happened 30 minutes later."
dx7i7wm,Dead_Knight07,"Sounds a lot more interesting with Ribery getting involved. Madrid players are bunch of feathers, Would dive on a single contact. Thanks for the clip though. At least, I got a taste of it."
dx7f6yu,Heblas,You could never shove someone from behind when they're clear on goal.
dx7f9eo,rbddit,"My point is he wasn't shoved, he barely touched him"
dx7fcp5,raul777him,https://i.imgur.com/Z2cHixJ.jpg
dx7fgnv,rbddit,If someone did that to you would you fall over?
dx7fon8,Heblas,I would if they also literally jump into me.
dx7gbsh,rbddit,Yeah he was already diving to the floor when he ‘jumped' on him
dx7gget,dohhhnut,Have you ever played football before? you get ready to head the ball like that for fucks sake
dx7gun5,rbddit,Yes I play every Saturday. And that is never a foul
dx7gmje,Heblas,Benatia leads with his arms. You can see Vazquez' body lurch forward as they make contact.
dx7gsht,rbddit,Because. He. Dived.
dx7hj9g,Heblas,"Fucking impressive to dive so convingly you can jerk your torso forward and keep your head in place, exactly like if you'd been shoved."
dx7hmx1,rbddit,All I'm saying is it that makes you fall over you're pretty weak
dx7i5w4,MyNameIsSushi,/r/IAmVeryBadAss material?I wanna see you withstanding someone *unexpectedly* putting 80kg on your back.
dx7i99h,rbddit,"Jesus Christ did you watch the game? He put his hands on his back. He barely pushed and definitely did not put all his weight on him, if not falling over form someone touching my back makes me a badass then yes I'm a badass."
dx7iija,MyNameIsSushi,"He was leaning forward to score which means he had less balance. He got kicked in the chest for god‘s sake, how is that not a foul?"
dx7ikhm,rbddit,"No he did not, benatias thigh touched his side"
dx7j3s8,MyNameIsSushi,> thigh touched his sideSeems like we agree then. Endangering opposing players by e.g. high boot *and* making any contact with the opposing player results in a penalty kick if it happens inside the box.
dx7j93y,rbddit,High boot. Are you serious?
dx7jibl,MyNameIsSushi,"Uh, yeah. Raising your foot to the enemy‘s waistline means high boot but that‘s not a foul according to the rules. The contact in combination with a high boot makes it a foul and it‘s up to the refree to decide because 'dangerous play' is not defined in the rules. Read the rules."
dx7jlqa,rbddit,"That's not high foot, that's no where near high foot"
dx7jnk1,MyNameIsSushi,"Obviously the ref thought otherwise. I‘m not here to argue with you, read the rules."
dx7k2au,rbddit,He didn't give the foul for a high foot
dx7kejh,MyNameIsSushi,Are you deft? That‘s exaxtly what I‘m saying. The combination of high boot *and* contact is a penalty. Dangerous play + contact inside the box = penaltyDangerous play inside the box without contact = indirect free kickNot that hard to understand.
dx7kq50,rbddit,Still don't understand how having your foot at hip level is a high boot?
dx7l5cn,MyNameIsSushi,"High boot isn‘t a rule but it falls under 'dangerous play'. Just read the rules, I don‘t know what else to tell you."
dx7lcwi,rbddit,Yeah I'm saying it isn't dangerous to have your leg at hip height
dx7liu3,MyNameIsSushi,"That‘s not for you to decide, it‘s the ref‘s decision as it says in the rules. I‘m not gonna reply anymore if you‘re not willing to accept that there are official rules every ref and every player has to follow."
dx7lqt8,rbddit,"What I'm saying is that isn't the rule, a foot at hip height isn't a high foot"
dx7m6th,MyNameIsSushi,There is no high foot rule. A foot at hip height is usually considered as dangerous play by refs though.
dx7l1gu,jetfuelcanmeltfeels,"If he was sprinting and I was standing still, yea"
dx7fann,xHUCx,Common. Ronaldo got dropped in the box about 5 minutes before the penalty jumping for a header with a good no call. You can't try to play the ball through another player especially when he has a chance on goal.
dx7ggy6,serafale,Kick to the chest not illegal contact now?
dx7gmy7,rbddit,Because that's what happened
dx7iou6,serafale,"That is definitely what happened. I'm all for contact in the form of shouldering off the ball, not pushing and kicking players in the back/chest."
dx7itu8,rbddit,He placed his hands on his back
dx7u997,bossOnothin,He shoved him and kicked him at the side of the chest.

dx7fye7,Kele15,Only thing Oliver did wrong was not showing Benatia a 2nd yellow.
dx7gb44,DavyH5,Tbh he probably forgot to with all that went on.
dx7ra1h,,[deleted]
dx81g2x,Nonzi,Would have been a red as he already had a yellow
dx8adjt,jdcv94,"Tbh thats a straight red. Vasquez a few yards from goal, clear goal scoring opportunity."
dx8bsqk,sosolastreethehe,"Refs don't give reds on top of penalties anymore, the rule was changed a few years ago"
dx8av4x,QuillRat,"Nope, he attempted to play the ball so it would have been a yellow at worst."
dx7e9b9,Dangerpala,"RIP juve, I feel sad for buffon tho"
dx7ez83,autslash,I dont tbh. That behaviour was just plain stupid. Deserved the red 100% going at the ref like that.
dx7goug,McghoulBerry,"Pretty sure he wouldn't do it if he was sober and thinking straight. Buffon is hot headed we know, but this situation is downright maddening for him. Last minute, last season, after turning around a 3-0 advantage, bit by bit, each goal makes you believe it more and then it all comes crashing down like this... I mean, give him a fucking break."
dx7h3i3,autslash,I understand what he did.. im just saying the red is deserved and he only has himself to blame for it. I know what emotions are and i cant imagine what i would be like in a situation like this.. Doesnt change the fact though.
dx7h0e7,TheMediumPanda,"I'm sure that sort of argument works in court too, ""Yes, your honor. I did indeed hit the guy with a crowbar and kicked his teeth in, but you've got to understand I was quite frustrated that day.""EDIT: If you downvote this, you're a fucking retard."
dx7l4rf,kubiozadolektiv,"He didn't hit anyone with a crowbar, nor kicked anyone's teeth in, did he now?"
dx8hbd4,McghoulBerry,"Nothing like a good ad hominem to make your argument impervious to any and all counter arguments, am I right? Well this is not a court, first of all. We are not discussing if someone broke the law, we are discussing if someone acted immorally or irresponsibly considering the situation. It is a naive mistake law abidance with morality or responsibility, which they are not. And lastly, yes it is an argument that could be posed and is almost every time posed by the attorneys, the emotional state of the perpetrator at the time of the crime, and not just for crowbars to the teeth but also knifes to the stomach and bullets to the head."
dx7gez9,prodigalkal7,"I don't get it, either. There's absolutely no discussion with it. He blew the whistle, made the call.. why run up to him and yell, and push and shove and do everything you can to get a red? For a player that's so professional and has such a sensational career, that was **such** an unprofessional and poor sportsmanship move on his part."
dx8eeoq,FPnigel,I don't I'm quite happyTottaly not the salt from when they kicked us out o.o
dx7ffed,CrazayTaylor92,His fault for acting like a little brat
dx7g40q,I_travel_for_work,"Yeah, but we can still feel bad, right? It sucks. Like I felt bad for Zidane in 2006. But that was dumb too."
dx7eakh,rapey_chef,Jesus what a fucking game
dx7e80t,tilmos,Really fucking brave from Michael OliverAnd it looks correct on both counts.
dx7eh3t,RoadToTopOfWeek,Don't think he'll be reffing in Italy any time soon
dx7eqm9,NanookOTN,Not without an armed guard around him.
dx7fghf,OneEyedGhoul17,He's welcomed in Milan anytime
dx7g9kf,TheSportsPanda,Perhaps also in Napoli.
dx7gxc2,danirijeka,Better not. He'll be invited in for so many coffees and pastries he'll gain 50kg within two hours at most.
dx7hzot,kdm1998,I love you
dx7pii5,GreekRomanGG,God I really can't wait for Juve to win their 7th consecutive scudetto so we can see ya'll crying again.

dx8m7zv,sanne2,and you can call them when you can get to the champions league
dx8vgpr,OneEyedGhoul17,"Soon my friend, just a little more time"
dx7fndz,Random_Acquaintance,Depends. I think he would get an standing ovation at Naples.
dx7f48p,quacainia,Maybe in Milan?
dx7g0vq,Prem_Naam_Hai_Mera,"Of course he won't, Juve couldn't buy him"
dx7et09,archip00p,Nor goon anywhere near Turin.

dx7ee19,Ante_Up_LFC,Toughest call he's probably ever had to make but he got it right
dx7fy9v,avleee,"You could see it from the look on his face. He cried as he pulled that red! I don't always like Oliver, but brilliant officiating today..."
dx7isaq,Cokey20,He's the best ref we have in the prem tho lol
dx7rzhl,KamiNoTsurugi,Howard Webb was better kappa
dx87kj2,meellodi,That's a weird way to write Mike Dean.
dx7hna7,Ante_Up_LFC,I was tearing to it was such an iconic moment but not the one we were looking for
dx7etgn,HailHelix123,No the call itself was easyBeing man enough to blow the whistle is awesome tho
dx7evui,Ante_Up_LFC,"Essentially what I'm getting at. It's not an easy call though, you forget the atmosphere, noise, and emotions that the ref's feel in the game too."
dx7gndi,kkultimate,The fact that penalty was against the away team helps imo. Harder to give against the home team
dx7h8x4,Ante_Up_LFC,For sure. I've seen refs get chewed out for intentionally not calling it for the home team to avoid this though too
dx7scvl,thedeliberative,That's what 'getting the call right' means. Holy fuck are you dumb.
dx7ey1e,-Darth-Jar-Jar,The ball hit Lucas' chest not Benatia

dx7eoab,Arctus9819,"No manhandling the referee. It doesn't matter who it is or at what minute, that is against the rules."
dx7f0n4,Lonidir,"I agree in that point. I was really shocked because I never saw anything like that from Buffon. Still though, straight red for Gigi´s reaction in that situation is a fucking big pill to swallow. I don´t really know what to say other than that."
dx7fpp0,kinginthenorthjon,"What do you guys think,was it penalty or not?"
dx7f7nk,Arctus9819,"Gutted for Gigi, but there's nobody to blame but themselves here. Benatia lost Vasquez, and Buffon got overly emotional. Sad way to go, too, I wanted Juve to go through."
dx7fezf,Murdoc1984,I feel bad for Gigi :( but any physical contact with the ref should be an automatic red.
dx7fhtb,chak100,"Well, let me tell you this: I'm sorry it ended like this. It was an amazing performance from Juve and I take my hat off.Be proud of your team because they are titans."
dx7i0zt,1lifter,"The dumbest part, is the mentality of people, who always think, that penalty is a 100% goal. Imagine the scenes if Buffon concentrated, instead of unleashing his anger, and actually saved the penalty."
dx7img1,Lonidir,"That sounds like a hard blame. You have to try and feel yourself into Gigis position in that moment imo.Not saying it was correct, just stating that I wouldn‘t have been strong enough to react in a better way."
dx7tukt,johnny_riko,Ronaldo penalty is pretty much as close as you get to a certain goal. I also don't think it would make any difference who was in goal. I don't know why they fouled him in the first place. There was more chance of Buffon saving an effort in the six yard box than there was someone stopping ronaldo's penalty.
dx7hbiu,crownpr1nce,"Yeah I dont think anyone would have been shocked or questioning it much if he pulled out a yellow, but the red was deserved unfortunately."
dx7fh8u,Izio17,[What about head butting him?](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/oliver.jpg?w=620&h=396&crop=1)

dx7frjj,kinginthenorthjon,Ask Ronaldo.He got 5 game ban for pushing referee.
dx7ewi1,,Nobody touches and shouts in the refs face like that mate. It's rare and always a red.
dx7f0f9,mlb_golf_and_porn,Shhhhhh. We are all pissed at Oliver for doing his job. Now is not the time for facts
dx7eyqf,benelchuncho,"It definitely happens at least 5 times a season, without a red"
dx7fd4p,,Maybe in Chile.
dx7eynh,Arctus9819,"No, pushing the ref around never happens. It is always just surrounding the ref."
dx7g82x,ta84351,jesus christ the referee is always at fault? gtfo here
dx7eo7q,Afjoo,I hope this is bait.
dx7eolr,costryme,"Please, that's not a dive. You can argue whether it's a penalty or not, but it's 100% not a dive."
dx7et56,WvdH01,"It's not a dive, but what really bothers me is how early he falls. It looks like he fell when he barely even felt a hand in his back."
dx7ez30,real_shadowave,Vasquez might have gone down easily but Benatia runs right through his back right in front of the net. Definitely a penalty
dx7k8un,virginiadicky,"I dunno man, I outweigh him by about one hundred pounds and I think if I weren't expecting that it would have knocked me down also. Maybe we people with that last name just fall down easily though."
dx7hbtl,Jerry1680,Benatia either needs to let the play unfold or put himself in a better position. How you gonna let Vasquez get goal side to you that late in eh game? Poor defending.
dx7hfvu,crownpr1nce,I think he was leaning forward to head it or chest control a low ball. In that situation its easy to be knocked off balance.But its definitely the right call.
dx7eybw,Halifax_Mooseheads,I agree with this. If we're gonna fix the issue of diving and soft freekicks/penalties we cant give them everytime a player goes down even tho there is some contact. They are top athletes not toddlers... red on Gigi correct tho
dx7h2ld,Karatos96,Wtf? Vasquez is unmarked in the box face against Buffon who miles away from him. There is zero reason to dive.
dx7eruk,Goudeyy,Benatia jumped on Vasquez's back and kicked him in the chest. If that's not a foul I don't know what is.
dx7ersg,sherlockholmez,Were you watching the same match? Pushes Vasquez in the back and also kinda kicks him. Then Buffon's reaction to a correct call afterward was embarrassing. Clear red.
dx7l8v5,Commandophile,> Buffon's reaction to a correct call afterward was embarrassing. ehhh.... in the moment?>Clear red. agreed
dx7fbsh,VodkaHappens,"> knockout stage you need to be able to handle someone getting angry at you.Mate what the fuck are you talking about? Imagine if it was the final, am I allowed to punch a ref if it's in extra time?"
dx7f0g0,JordanRossiter,"I feel sorry for you, obviously you're a Juve fan or Real hater but both calls were correct mate. Buffon basically assaulted the ref, Benatia pushed Vazquez, shit happens."
dx7erzy,wherethewhite,*Signed Angry Juve Fan*
dx7ev2k,Emptinessenthralls,"> It's a pretty fucking clear dive. Benatia pushed Vazquez with both hands... > And if you're going to give a penalty at 93 minutes of a champions league knockout stage you need to be able to handle someone getting angry at you. Wat. 1st minute, last minute,... doesn't really matter. I really feel bad for Buffon, but you can't get in the refs face like that."
dx7eqqc,WildVariety,"You don't grab the referee, in *any* situation. Oliver is very quick to send players off for doing that, and always has been."
dx7euw7,falkous,"Fuck that, you have no idea what Buffon said to him. The guy was going mental in his face, that's a big fat fuck you to the entire idea of respect towards referees no matter the occasion. I don't like Oliver at all but he had the right whilst Buffon had literally none."
dx7f93p,Karlo_Mlinar,Over 200 hundred people disagreed with you in 6 minutes.That's something special.
dx7fngn,kinginthenorthjon,> Buffon a red card is fucking disgracefulIs there a rule that Buffon can't be carded?I love Buffon but he deserved that Red just like Ronaldo got 5 match pan for pushing the referee.
dx7ep8o,lavasmoke,Penalty could have gone either way. Red had to be given
dx7ewbg,jordank94,This has to be a copypasta right
dx7epcp,TommoDrommo,A soft penalty is still a penalty
dx7epc7,patriots4545,The salt is real 😂😂😂
dx7f3hg,Imsortofabigdeal,"I disagree, I think he showed the chops to make big calls at big times. He was decisive on a really difficult decision. Confidence is important"
dx7esua,MaxPayne4life,I've always hated that fucking cunt.
dx7euod,channel_PURPLE,"He really did get it right. He was pushed and kicked in the chest. Regardless of what the setting was, that's a penalty, and Buffon deserved a red for not only screaming in his face, but running into him multiple times. It's a shitty way to end the game, but it's the right call"
dx7et1b,Rmonte90,Damn bro. All these flavors and you choose saltHala Madrid !
dx7mi0z,Trance2000,Delusional.
dx7enkq,Crot4le,He got it horrifically wrong.
dx7fi8e,Ante_Up_LFC,"It's a penalty mate, I know it sucks and I wanted Juve to do it but you can't look at it emotionally. It's stonewall."
dx7frg9,Crot4le,I couldn't give a toss about the result. I'm just calling it as I see it.
dx7fwst,reece0n,You see it wrong
dx7g5sw,Crot4le,Contact =/= foul
dx7g8su,reece0n,"Agreed! Unfortunately for Juve, this was both"
dx7hp6p,Ante_Up_LFC,You do know that no contact could be anfoul too right? It works both ways!
dx7grcc,Coltraine89,"He really didn't. On both accounts. It pains me to say it but it WAS a penalty, and Buffon manhandled the ref which is (and always should be) auto red card. Emotions got the better of him, and I'm sure he'll realize it soon.Shitty end to a wonderful game? Abso-fucking-lutely. But that's hardly the referee's fault. He ran a pretty tight ship, except maybe Ronaldo diving a bit too much... Oh well."
dx7en0t,joaoll,He really didn't
dx7fbr4,pauliewalnuts82,It was a pen but a soft one. Vazquez was always going to go down no matter what. Clumsy challenge but unfortunately a defender can't even touch a striker in the box these days or the striker will go down like he's been shot.
dx7el7a,Handpuppets,"Just hope this is one of the top comments in the end, because you are completely correct.Everyone outraged because they hate Real Madrid, but that's a penalty and Buffon's reaction was unacceptable."
dx7fmg4,reddhitghost11,"A penalty just 20 seconds before extra time, after having to come back from a 3 goal deficit. Even Gandhi wouldn't keep his peace."
dx7gar4,Benjehh,Gandhi would've launched a nuke after that.
dx7gkz1,Walmartsavings2,Civ references in r/soccer. Never thought I'd see the day.
dx7p3hy,Moshkown,What a time to be alive
dx7m9pb,rayray604,/r/civ
dx7fa05,Thufir_Hawatz,"I agree the PK was the right call, but I find it hard to say ""Buffon's reaction was unacceptable"" without knowing what he said"
dx7fpdz,intecher,He pushed him if u watch the clip actually.
dx7gtqf,Thufir_Hawatz,Oh I must have missed the push then. My eyes were glued to the screen idk how I missed it
dx7i4ua,Limo_in_my_Hand,> pushedwhen? I don't see it in this clip.
dx7fyem,A3xMlp,"Yeah, but seriously, in this case it should slide. If you send off you kill the game, even if they miss the pen. Give him a yellow and some strong words, for the games' sake."
dx7ganl,smokeyriviera,And just scrap any idea of respect for the ref just because of the situation? Nah that's bullshit man
dx7h3eu,A3xMlp,"No, it's not. This game is too good to fuck in the last minute, you're not scraping the idea at all. If Buffon only got yellow nobody would bat an eye, it would have no impact on further reactions towards refs."
dx7hjwx,smokeyriviera,"Nope one individual decision wouldn't but it would set a precedent for this to be allowed which of course might be followed by similar incidents of disrespect. Its a can of worms once you start allowing the state of the game to start dictating your decisions. Also, if Ronaldo missed and Buffon was allowed to play then Madrid fans would be complaining that he didn't get sent off for an obvious red card"
dx7i5hb,A3xMlp,"Would they complain? I really don't see it, especially considering it's Gigi. Again, I don't think you're opening a can of worms. Next to the penalty it would go under the radar, and by end nobody would think of it. They'd think of either the pen or the ET, regardless how it ends."
dx7iic6,smokeyriviera,"Really it's all hypothetical and we won't know an answer but my opinion is that the players reputation and the situation of the game should have the smallest effect possible on the ref. In this case Gigi is so far past the line of acceptable behaviour he can't even see it. Therefore I feel the red is justified. For example when Roy Keane chased Andy D'Urso, noone rememebers the game, but everyone remembers Keane screaming in his face"
dx7pi6h,sebas8181,Sadly in a couple of weeks the story that we won bc of the ref and it wasn't penalty will remain in this sub to the eternity. Today everyone says refs gave RM the win against Bayern even when the ref made bad decisions against BOTH teams.
dx7f8eu,mr-fiend,It won't be. Everyone's so butthurt that they're letting their bias cloud their judgement.
dx7orkl,ILoveToph4Eva,And yet here it is with just under 3000 upvotes. Almost as if people can concede that it was a penalty despite how much the majority of us wanted to see you lose.
dx7g3ru,vj_34,Pushing the ref was a card too far
dx7iltf,LeftHookTKD,It was a dive for sure. You don't give a call like that this late in a tied game. Terrible reffing
dx7edxv,SureCase,The commentators say it's the right decision
dx7eknq,srbarker15,That's how you know it's right
dx7f90j,bjb7621,No but they're definitely more qualified than the average redditor to weigh their opinion in.
dx7fu9c,miguel_is_a_pokemon,"Pretty easy to tell who's an average Redditor and who's not, since all the smart ones just happen to agree with my viewpoints"
dx7h4ho,jorsiem,this guy gets it
dx7i240,kdm1998,Agreed
dx7m858,kappa23,Yeah I agree that Miguel is a Pokémon.
dx7fzwa,I_travel_for_work,Unless it's Lalas
dx7fxiw,Bunny_Killer,Sometime this is up for debate. I sometimes see them disagreeing with calls when the written rules are clear as day. I do think this was the right call though.
dx7gb8i,ta84351,thats 99% of the time the FOX commentators
dx7g9ph,-zimms-,"The average redditor is pretty shit though. There are tons of commentators out there who have no clue.This was the right call though, unfortunately. Would have loved to see 30 more minutes of this game."
dx7gcmq,fua_neng,"Wrong. In every sport, professional commentators are are always the 100-200 least knowledgeable people out of all 7 billion of us on earth. Or at least that's what the internet told me"
dx7h00v,letsgetcool,"I mean, not necessarily. They're hired because they're good with words, not always because of their football IQ."
dx7h7gj,WtfMayt,Yeah but I've played fifa a few times so I'm basically a pundit?
dx7hij1,shico12,"why? maybe for first time calls but not replays, I can see the rules and watch the action as well as they can."
dx7g285,Feiyue,More qualified or not there is definite pressure on commentators to agree with the calls being made.
dx7fakt,hadrian-blackwater,"Some people don't think the call be like it is, but it do"
dx7ewlt,DDAisADD,Collingsworth is right all the time.
dx7emg9,ZaaltorTheMerciless,Are you watching in America on Fox? Because they are fucking morons.
dx7et83,breadnbutterr,Fox commentators are fucking trash. I'd rather listen in silence than listen to them
dx7h62e,SurroundSex,I was watching online streams from Fox and those fuckers made me pay for cable to get rid of them.
dx7i4jl,sinrakin,The real counter to piracy.
dx7hw2e,stcwhirled,Don't know if they have Champions League but that's exactly why it's usually better to tune in on Telemundo or Univision.
dx7f25w,ssddeae,"Agreed. Only positive about the USMNT not being in Russia is that not having to hear the arrogant, deluded Alexi Lalas. Can't stand that guy.Taylor Twellman, Stuart Holden(only as a pundit), Kyle Martino are the only respectable commentators/pundits. Bob Ley isn't bad either."
dx7g6cr,coopsquared,I've got some bad news for you on who's covering the world cup
dx7lrrl,donodank,Ian Joy is decent. He's pretty level headed when calling Bundesliga and NYCFC matches.
dx7ezyd,happy_waldo,I swear if I have to hear Alexi Lalas commentate one more game...
dx7hmaw,stcwhirled,> I swear if I have to hear Alexi Lalas ever again...FTFY
dx7et5b,SureCase,Lol nope in South Africa. They get a British stream.
dx7gt2p,dohhhnut,DSTV FTW
dx7ewfj,Danjiks88,I was. They said it's right hahahahah Dunno if you were but if not that was a spot on guess
dx7fcob,Thufir_Hawatz,"They're so bad ahaha. It's gotten to the point where they are only about 15% correct on their ""judgement"" of the ref's call, so I just always assume they're wrong"
dx7fezr,BimbelMarley,Lol why would we do that
dx7io9l,cristiano10s,It wasn't a pen tho so in this case they are right
dx89x22,Dakota0524,"The Champions League going to Turner couldn't come any sooner. If the NBA, MLB, and golf coverage is any indicator, they'll get quality talent and not fuck this up."
dx7ew0j,SwampFox4,"Yeah they are, but they were right on this one. That's a pen."
dx7evtp,filfy_toad,Bein.
dx7ilex,Smfonseca,BEIN has the only English speaking commentators I will listen to. Ray Hudson is hilarious!
dx7fe57,Korrk,"How in the hell can you call that a soft pen? He went right through him, and he never touched the ball."
dx7fp27,RAFFST4R,"The only competent ones are the ones that were hired by eurosport, granted they were not speaking english, but they're the first that I heard that didn't always get offended by the ref's decisions"
dx7eiq2,stafffy,The commentators talk shite
dx7eycb,RoronoaAshok,"Commentators are clueless in comparison to the Infallible Visionaries of r/soccer, I agree."
dx7f5so,stafffy,"I believe that if we collected everyone subscribed to this subreddit's shite and formed a humanoid figure from it to commentate on a match, It would still surpass anything that sky or bt sport can offer commentary wise"
dx7fc6m,RoronoaAshok,I do not.
dx7fggz,stafffy,And that's your opinion :)
dx7eq44,trobial,"often yes, but not this time."
dx7eyrm,Lorenzo_Insigne,Doesn't mean they can't be right.
dx7es3o,EzPzyChickenJalfrezi,"I think it was a penalty, he jumps into his opponent with more momentum than necessary."
dx7f7qg,Rodsoldier,"Brazilians from ~Fox~(Not fox) don't think so(Zico is one of them). Imo it was, live, 100% clear penal. On replay there might be an argument, but that shouldn't really count anyway."
dx7foq4,SureCase,I agree. The ref only had real time and it looked a pen to me as well. You can't come from behind like Benatia did
dx7gk40,Rodsoldier,"probably just announcers feeding the controversy to increase social media and stuff, this channel relies heavily on that."
dx7fd3g,retiringtoast8,"It was for sure the right decision, but commentators saying so doesn't make it right. The same English broadcast commentators also said earlier ""You don't usually associate yellow kits with being brave and bold""... ignoring 5x World Cup champions Brazil, Dortmund, Colombia, and Arsenal (Away) Invincibles. I wish I had a smooth voice so I could get paid to talk straight out of my ass."
dx7f5cc,MrPringles23,Well if you had the commentators the other game had on Bein you'd never utter those words again.Gary Birtles is the worst co commentator ever. Worse than Robbie Savage etc. Pretty much whatever the opposite of what he says is correct. That's when he's not injecting his own opinion every third sentence on things you wouldn't even want someone respected's opinion on.I've had the fucking torture of listening to him for 4 straight matches (United v Sevilla and Bayern v Sevilla) and I'm really hoping he's nowhere near the semis.
dx7hi30,Rummenigge,not on Sky Germany smh
dx7eodt,WorldsWorstFather,Those same commentators last night were saying that offside was the correct decision on Sane.
dx7etta,GJardim,"Zico is a commentator for our channel that broadcast it here in Brazil. He said it wasn't a penalty because, in slow motion, you can see how Real Madrid's player starts falling before the contact, and the ball is even touched by the Juventus' player.But we need a better replay angle than all of those."
dx7fbss,SureCase,We're lucky because we have the benefit of slow motion. In real time you absolutely cannot come from behind like Benatia did and not expect a foul. I don't blame Oliver for that one bit.
dx7feyj,GJardim,And that's why we need VAR for moments like this one. People here are already blaming Oliver for it.
dx7fqog,sebas8181,"He was falling because freaking Benatia pushed him from behind even before attempting to kick the ball. In fact he didn't even touched the ball, you can see how the only time the ball was deflected was when it hit LV's chest at the end."
dx7gqzt,GJardim,"We are watching replays nonstop since the end of the game in this channel from another angle other than this one from the thread. The moment LV starts falling happens before he is ""pushed"" and Benatia did touch the ball. Zico is explaining that many times while the replays are shown.But, if he's indeed pushed and hits LV's chest, it's a penalty, no matter if the ball was touched by Benatia or not."
dx7jyjd,sebas8181,"You can repeat it as many times as you want. You can scream it to the sky if you want, that doesn't mean it wasn't a foul."
dx7es57,iceworlock2,If you are on fox sports they love to suck Ronaldo's dick.
dx7ernp,Kloncs,It's definitely not the correct decision. What is the foul there?
dx7em7f,flyingkiwi9,Yep. If not a push in the back then probably dangerous play / high foot.
dx7ept9,fools_eye,"Yup, don't understand people saying VAR this that, it is a penalty.Oliver was very good in this game!"
dx7i0yp,LukeRipa,"VAR should be there regardless of this penalty - last year quarter-final between Bayern and Real proves that in an indisputable way. When you have hundreds of millions of euros at stakes in prize alone, you can't rely solely on the subjectivity of an individual that 90% of the times don't have an optimal position to judge a foul (because that's the reality of the matter) that happens in a fraction of a second, who also as an immense pressure to do what's right - very few individuals in the world are cold-blooded, and most of these people are not football refs.Introducing VAR would also remove a ton of pressure from the refs. They can correct their mistakes.UEFA being against var is a cancerous thing because the more Ceferin states he's against it the more people will think there are some extra-competitive reasons for such decision."
dx7i8dx,fools_eye,"I dont disagree with you at all, but in context of this tie, the decision wouldn't change at all so there is no point in bringing that up now."
dx7k2sv,LukeRipa,"Dude, let's be honest: the same play the other way around would have been a no-call. And it's hard for me to admit as I hate Juventus, but c'mon...It's right to bring it up now as the first leg would have ended most likely 3-1 with VAR, as a clear penalty on Cuadrado at the 90th wasn't awarded. Again, we need VAR. And every time is the right time to bring that up."
dx7foxt,special66x,This is not a penalty never...watch some diftrent angels...he fell before benatia even touched him... shame
dx7ft8y,fools_eye,Watch it a week later and re evaluate your opinion.
dx7fvxq,special66x,"I am neutral, i just watched replays and yeah... wont change my decision.."
dx7g0jd,fools_eye,"> My father is a big Barca fan and i fall in love with Ronaldinho... Messi and tiki taka made relationship with Barca""I am neutral"""
dx7jm98,special66x,"Dude even if i love barca, we are out tottaly deserved. But this penal is just shitshow... In the end of tje they Real isnt guilty that got a penal... if you get one make sure to realize it... but shame on Uefa... City got fucked too yesterday"
dx7fxz1,fools_eye,Cool.
dx7fx3h,Gokuwaj1218,Man I get it you hate real. But look at it objectively and be honest with yourself. This is a clear penalty.If that was a juve player getting fouled like that would you still deny that it was a foul?
dx7karb,special66x,"Hate real? Dont tell me what i do. I respect them, would be boring without them. I watched replay and maked my mind... the leg of benatia was to high i dont deny that therr werent no push involved.. thate just how i saw a thing no hate no hard feelings.. but okey..lets just down vote me and tell people who i hate..."
dx7kkvj,Gokuwaj1218,I'm saying you hate real because there's no other reason to insist on it not being a penalty.Watch the alternate angles. You can clearly see that there‘s a push with the knees and even the hands a bit.If you don‘t see that you‘re in denkal.I‘m not attacking you I‘m just saying be objecitve.No hard feelings.Have a nice evening
dx7ergn,SirPoliwhirl,"Yeah r/soccer jumping to conclusions once again. I think the red card was harsh. I hoped Juve would go through. But come on, that was a penalty. If it were your club you would be screeching the entire neighbourhood together. Difficult decision, but a fair one."
dx7expa,Nerverek,"Its a definitely a foul and penalty by definition. But it looked a little soft. But fair play, very brave call from Michael Oliver there, and can't say he's wrong."
dx7eubn,HailHelix123,Honestly the ref was amazing there.
dx7eku3,dakikko,Surely more of the Juve players could have been booked there for crowding around him like that for a solid 5 mins
dx7f83d,Djimq777,It was correct but this sub sometimes loses its brain.
dx7ekne,still_love_her_sigh,Michael Oliver is one of the best refs there is. Don't @ me.
dx7i9uq,Princecoyote,"The call to send off Buffon was extremely brave. Buffon was completely out of order, but I'm not sure every referee would have the composure to pull out the red. They also said Michael Oliver was only added in January to the referee list that can officiate this level of match."
dx7efrg,onlyonejorge,So brave to give Madrid a penalty in the last minute in their stadium.
dx7ekq9,,[deleted]
dx7g55q,onlyonejorge,"We're talking in the context of bravery though. If he was giving a penalty to Juve in the last minute with 80,000 fans all against it plus millions more watching at home that would be bravery imo."
dx8bk58,arbalete,It's brace because everyone watching will tear him apart for it (like you may have noticed is happening).
dx7f9vp,YeimzHetfield,"Yeah, with that replay from high up you can see the shove a lot clearer. Kind of soft, but when heading even the softest shove can take you off balance."
dx7fb2d,,[deleted]
dx7fouv,Ante_Up_LFC,But also it's such a great goal scoring opportunity you really can't complain. Not like he's got his back to goal on the side of the 18 barely in it. He's on the 6 for cryin out loud it's not ta tough decision
dx7fdu1,ImPradaOfYou,"Wouldn't call it clear..... it's a foul, but if he hadn't call it, nobody would be able to say anything. He basically was lucky. He had no clear view and was far away. He literally trusted the striker"
dx7flia,Ante_Up_LFC,"If he didn't call it the narrative would be he was too soft to call an obvious pen because of being in Madrid. He wasn't going to win either way, so I'm glad he made the right decision, albeit the unpopular one. I was really pulling for Juve too"
dx7fyjh,ImPradaOfYou,"I doubt it. Ronaldo is known for falling faster than a ripe apple. And the ref position would have gave him the benefit of the doubt. I think people would have been happier if he didn't call it.Sure real Madrid fans wouldn't, but who cares. (Got the wrong player) ~~is a professional diver, amongst some others, and we all know that~~"
dx7gdcy,warriorpaiya,"But the foul wasn't on Ronaldo though. It was Lucas Vasquez in front of the goal, who was fouled by Benatia."
dx7gwq0,ImPradaOfYou,Yes. But everything else stands
dx7hxgq,warriorpaiya,"While I agree that Ronaldo dives at times and goes to the ground easily, that was definitely a penalty no matter who was in that position. That was a foul, and in the post match discussion between Rio & Gerrard, they played a different angle where you can clearly see Oliver was in a good position to see the challenge, and he made the right call because he clearly saw what happened there."
dx7git3,OldFakeJokerGag,Did you ever watch the fucking game? Pen wasn't even on Ronaldo.
dx7gufl,ImPradaOfYou,"First of all, calm down. Secondly I got the wrong player but everything else stands"
dx7gy9o,OldFakeJokerGag,"How does it stand if your only line of thought is literally ""he has a reputation for diving so the referee should assume he dived as well"" but you're not even talking about the right player?"
dx7h9kb,ImPradaOfYou,You take whatever else is right about it. Which is that the ref didn't have a clear view.
dx7eped,nocendi,Clear foul? Seriously?
dx7f7j0,Sqube,"No snark here: under what circumstances can you try to run directly through someone's back and kick around them and have it not be a foul?If you wanted to say he went down too easy, then that's an argument that you can try to make. But even then... it's *still* a foul, even if he sells it (which I think he did, a bit). Selling fouls is hardly unique to Madrid and unique to this circumstance."
dx7fehc,nocendi,"> No snark here: under what circumstances can you try to run directly through someone's back and kick around them and have it not be a foul?You can't, but that really didn't happen here. If you think that contact was anywhere close to ""running directly through him"", then I don't think we're seeing the same game."
dx7fsp4,Sqube,"The defender had absolutely no position. If you want to say Lucas went down too easily, that's one thing. But if he had stood strong he would have caught a knee to the spine.The only reason he didn't run through him is because the man went down, but... come on. You have to call that, every time, whether it's the first game of the season or the World Cup final."
dx7hg9b,nocendi,"From the sideline camera it looks that way, but when you see the replay from behind the goal it's clear that his direction is towards the goal, not through the player."
dx7u0vt,TILiamaTroll,it's just too bad that the player was between the goal and Benatia
dx8arrf,nocendi,"I think if you slow-mo [this video](https://a.pomfe.co/ouxwy.mp4) at around 0:20 you'll see what I mean. He isn't between him and the goal, and he isn't jumping into him, he's jumping parallel to him.That's exactly what I mean when I say that I think this looked like a penalty from the sideline camera, but not from the goal line camera where you have a better angle.Now, if you feel like ""kicking around"" a player should be a penalty then, I will not argue against that, because that seems like a pretty subjective call. But the claim that he is running/jumping through the player is just not supported by the video."
dx8okp0,TILiamaTroll,Dead link
dx7f0hk,thebokehwokeh,"Tell me how the defender without the position, who runs into the player with the position and bowls him over from behind without possession is not a foul.It's a tough call because of the circumstances (literally last minute) but it's a fucking penalty all day every day."
dx7fjbm,TjaosMaker,He barely touches him before Lucas is on the ground
dx7f6dd,aure__entuluva,"I do think a penalty was the right decision, but the video above doesn't show the angle that shows you that Benatia doesn't knee him in the back / bowl him over and actually is just trying to get his foot around him towards the ball."
dx7ewpr,,[deleted]
dx7fgqa,nocendi,I 100% seriously disagree with you.
dx7fm3a,dillpickles007,What is there to disagree about? If you don't think that was a penalty then you literally don't know the rules of the game
dx7gqjo,Kitnado,Mate I'm telling you now there's no point. Even if God himself came down from the heavens to call a foul there would be idiots on Reddit disputing the call. You could have this discussion in literally every thread. Best to leave them be.
dx7hkkb,nocendi,"There are no rules of the game that clarifies the degree of contact necessary for a foul to be given. That's a referees discretion, and I don't agree with this referee. There was very little physical contact, and while the sideline camera makes it look like he runs straight into him, the behind the goal camera clearly shows that he doesn't.There's no rule or misunderstanding of the rule that's relevant here, it's a question of amount of contact. Football isn't like basketball, where the amount of contact is irrelevant as long as there *is* contract."
dx7jpt2,AntiChr1st,I never thought I would say this.I agree with the Man United fan
dx7f7p2,acore8694,Dude. The defender kicked at his side waist high because he was late. The Madrid player was squared up 2m from the goal ready to try and win it. Just because maybe it would have been better to let the play go from juventus having a chance to save it rather than give up a penalty doesn't mean it wasn't a foul.
dx7fdau,nocendi,">Dude. The defender kicked at his side waist high because he was late. Even so, it was a play for the ball, and he hit the ball. A defender has to be allowed to try to defend. >Just because maybe it would have been better to let the play go from juventus having a chance to save it rather than give up a penalty doesn't mean it wasn't a foul.No, it doesn't, but that contact is way too little for me to feel like that should be a penalty."
dx7ertc,thegodsthemselvs,Just because it was the right call doesn't make it a brave decision. Doing your job and being a good ref shouldnt make it so people have to call you brave.
dx7f3z4,motedders,"""And the winner of dumbest comment of the night goes to..."""
dx7eybd,suspectfuton,"Honestly yeah it was. To make a call that basically eliminates a team from a competition like the Champions League despite them being on track for a massive comeback. Not calling a pk in that situation is going to be less controversial - but Oliver does it anyways because he thinks it was a foul. That takes a huge amount of courage, regardless of if the call is correct or not."
dx7ektx,ayotui,Was it not a penalty though?
dx7fpas,powergs,He isnt saying its not penalty he is saying its easy to give Madrid a penalty in Bernabeu last minute which he is right.
dx7gst7,onlyonejorge,"Yes, Oliver would be one of the bravest refs ever if he gave a last second penalty to Juve in Madrid . That's the weight of the world on you then."
dx7jucv,guyfieri_fc,"I didn't think it was a penalty but I'm a huge barca fan so I'm redacting myself from this argument, no way i can be unbiased"
dx7eviw,spongebuddy58,soft one I guess
dx7f6rn,ItsMikeontheMic,Delusional
dx7ha5c,spongebuddy58,I mean the ref was calling soft fouls for real madrid the whole game so it wasn't unexpected
dx7etnl,,[deleted]
dx7f0it,ayotui,He fucking pushed him from and behind and kicked him in the chest...
dx7f9po,SmokeQuack,"The guy was on his way down before the Juve player touched him. Yeah I'm gonna seem biased because of my flair, but fuck this shit, it's a really soft pen if anything."
dx7fmzi,ayotui,"Watch it again, Vasquez doesn't start falling until after the Juve player jumps behind him. You can even see his hand touch his back."
dx7fzgg,SmokeQuack,"I still think it's soft, but whatever, it's Benatias mistake to even go in like that."
dx7g2kl,ayotui,"I can agree that it ruined the match, but it's a clear pen."
dx7g9kx,SmokeQuack,Fair enough. Agree to disagree.Don't you dare fuckin' win it again though!
dx7gcn1,ayotui,"Oh, but we will. Ronaldo will get an offside goal, and then dive for a pen."
dx7ggvl,SmokeQuack,"Oh God, I want to hang myself even thinking of it."
dx7fc5t,owiseone23,"It looks like that from the behind the goal angle, but that's cause you can't see the contact from the back before he falls."
dx7fhjb,SmokeQuack,"I've seen 3 replays, maybe I haven't seen the angle that you're talking about. But this does bring sour taste to my mouth.You could be right, still the shittiest way for Gigi's (probably) final CL game after tonights heroics."
dx7ff8l,,[deleted]
dx7fk12,owiseone23,"Nah the angle from behind obscures where the contact occurs, which is on Lucas Vazquez's back. You can't see him being pushed over because Lucas's torso is in the way."
dx7fsk2,Prosthemadera,"Well, even if it was: The defender should really know better than to jump him like that. It's a rookie mistake."
dx7g0mh,SmokeQuack,"I absolutely agree with that, never argued against it."
dx7eq9v,joyuser,Never a pen..
dx7f9ze,jordank94,PJSalt
dx7er7k,EnragedScrotum,It's a pen.
dx7f8u7,helmut-schnaugenberg,He was already halfway down when the contact was made.
dx7emba,YO_2the_LO,Clearly was a pk saltyboi
dx7eqvq,moz10,"You have no idea what you are talking about. A lot easier to just let it go to extra time, this was decisive."
dx7eno7,mijnpaispiloot,"Bulking to the pressure of not only the crowd but also his boss, very brave man indeed."
dx7ettp,IAmWhatTheRockCooked,Truly. What immense courage to do such an outrageous thing.
dx7f02d,matrix325,More brave than Apple
dx7f0cw,EDGY_USERNAME_I_USE,But if he's wrong he gets absolutely crucified. It's unfortunate but it was the correct decision.
dx7fp4f,Prosthemadera,Shouldn't have fouled the other player then.
dx7meoc,LinXcze,If it was penalty against Getafe in 26th minute nobody would be even discusing it. Just because it's Madrid ending r/soccer fairytale in the last minute it's being blown out of proportions.
dx7eoxd,ZaaltorTheMerciless,I think it was a pen. Pretty harsh sending Buffon off though.
dx7g7db,arijitlive,what? Buffon pushed him? He already pushed over by Di Maria and sent him out. Why differ this time?
dx7eppx,monnii99,"It's brave to make a call a penalty when you know ow it will decide who goes through in the very last minute, no matter the stadium."
dx7efol,Stramanor,Really fucking shit as well
dx7erv6,Konker101,"Absolute penalty, plus GiGi pushed the ref, his own fault in getting a red."
dx7fu1f,Stramanor,Penalty was questionable and the red was deserved.
dx7emog,WinstonHustle,Right now his wife will be taking Italy off the holiday list tho
dx7es6h,mudkipzcrossing,"All context aside I think you have to give that. Benatia also clearly had two hands on Vasquez' back as well as he approached him, which is a bad look especially if the ref is behind the play as he was in this situation."
dx7exh7,fcbole,"I can understand the anger, but it could be given."
dx7f9qr,ShadowDandy,"Yeah, because nobody gives penalties to poor Real Madrid"
dx7ferh,Faga_Beefe,"100% a penalty, absolutely."
dx7g8qa,aqua_maris,He should've booked Benatia here for stopping obvious goalscoring opportunity and that's actually a big mistake.
dx7lzzc,Heine-Cantor,"To think that in Italy ""journalists"" went on for all the interviews saying that the side referee should have said that it wasn't a penalty, that the VAR wouldn't have conceded it, that the referee was too young. I mean, siding with the team of your own country is a thing, but being so much dishonest as not to put a single doubt it could have, in fact, be a penalty is something else."
dx7qqqf,rsyay,Shouldn't Benatia be also sent off for the tackle? I mean it would've been even more salt.
dx7x908,nickelbagoffunk,You don't make that call in that game. Let them go to extra time and decide it.
dx89ytw,sk07ch,"Didn't watch the game, but how did it end up 7min overtime? Was the pen challenged already after the extra time given at 4/5min?"
dx7fkoo,mxchickmagnet86,I totally disagree. IMHO the Madrid player's legs start to cave before Benatia even reaches him. He's looking to go down with that contact the whole way. If he wanted to stay up he would have put his feet farther out and leaned back to brace himself. If he was trying to stoop and head it ( which I doin't think he was ) he would have kept his eyes on the ball and made contact regardless of Benatia because his momentum would have kept him moving towards the ball to generate power.
dx7ma0z,Zizoud,I'm with you here. I think the referee has bailed the coward out.
dx7egop,Kloppite1,"Wrong decision imo, very soft. The red was deserved though, not an acceptable reaction from Buffon"
dx7elif,Bozzetyp,"Benatia has no right to go through Vasquez ...And his feet does hit him high - stupid, dangerous and a foul.But I agree the contact is soft"
dx7er4p,nachomancandycabbage,What contact
dx7etkv,ThomasGravesen,The one we are talking about. Haven't you seen the video??
dx7ex4o,nachomancandycabbage,"Yes... I did. My point was , it was very fucking soft. I wasn't being literal"
dx7ejmt,QuillRat,"Goes through the back of the player, gets the ball after the man. How is it soft?"
dx7er4m,SoSpursy,He most likely would have put that away if not for the foul. Def pen.
dx7escj,YRN_YSL,Anyone who says that isn't a penalty doesn't know what they're talking about.
dx7eq8s,Irctoaun,"Watch the Real player's head, you can see it was a shove because the body goes forward and the head stays still for a moment. You can't fake that"
dx7ejde,ResplendentDreamer,I think it's the red that's the more contentious one. Yellow at most
dx7ewh5,QuillRat,You cannot grab hold of the ref like that.
dx7esll,crownpr1nce,Buffon bumped him and twisted him. Definitely the right call. He should not have touched the ref no matter how much he disagrees with the call.
dx7er87,RibboCG,Its a red because buffon manhandled the referee. You dont assault a ref and stay on the pitch jeez.
dx7ewz4,a_lumberjack,"He grabbed the ref from behind while screaming at him. You have to send him off there.Doesn't matter though, Buffon wouldn't have stopped the penalty either."
dx7ers8,EnragedScrotum,Nah it's a clear pen.
dx7eudh,fahomnom,"Clear goal scoring opportunity, goes right through the back of the player. If anything Benatia should've deserved a 2nd yellow as well, clear as day penalty"
dx7echg,,[deleted]
dx7ehkh,UneasyInsider,Looked like the right decision on the replay.
dx7einn,Haamaimadrasi,how the fuck is that not a penalty? benatia just barges in...
dx7ejn3,LeoIsLegend,"Pretty straight-forward penalty, great call."
dx7ehec,dylxesia,He pushed him in the back and hit him with his left leg. The fuck more do you need for a penalty?
dx7enzh,doomguy68,Yeah and he was basically 1 on 1 with buffon
dx7ep4n,Wildelocke,I just haven't seen this push in the back. Which angle?
dx7exr0,MrKearns,Italian fans must be the only ones who can be presented with video evidence of a foul and still cry about everything being a conspiracy against them.
dx7emlg,hufusa,got fooled lmao this guy
dx7ezl8,Coenagrion_armatum,To be fair Real player had no intention of staying up - he fell down right at the moment he felt something touch him. 99% if such collision happens any other time in the game (not last few minutes) and/or anywhere else on the field (not in the penalty box) - he wouldn't fall = no foul (contact was minimal). Sucks that the game was decided in such way...
dx7fwig,niner-nation,he was also going for the header while Benatia pushed him.
dx7enxt,FreeOaks,Benatia (?) didn't come diving in with two feet up from five yards out so according to r/soccer it can't be a pen.
dx7eu6w,blacktiger226,"The push was very soft ans the fall was in a direction that has nothing to do with the direction of the left leg kick. Yes it was a foul, but also the referee got fooled by the exaggerated dive."
dx7epo9,mijnpaispiloot,Him not on the floor before hitting him would probably be a good one.
dx7emyh,Irockin28,RM was diving all night looking for a pk...I don't disagree it's a penalty... but they couldn't have fallen any easier
dx7ehuo,AyyyyyyyyyLmao69,lol was clear pen.
dx7eisc,supaboss2015,Got fooled how? It is a penalty. I just think it was harsh to send him off
dx7ekhx,RedMoon14,"It was definitely a penalty though, no matter how much I wish it wasn't."
dx7elmp,staluxa,Since when giving a pen for pushing with hands attacker trying to finish from 2 yards is not a foul. It was a 100% right call.
dx7elum,lore473,"What do you mean fooled?It was quite the obvious penalty, actual question, to me at least is a clear penalty, if Benatia hadn't pushed Vasquez down he would probably had scored.Edit: fluffed the ending of the phrase, ironical whilst talking about Juventus."
dx7fh4p,sebas8181,How [pushing](https://imgur.com/3bdcXNw) and [kicking in the chest not a foul](https://imgur.com/Ns6stec)?
dx7ehe9,Seithin,"Initially it looked like a pen to me, but on the replays I'm getting more and more doubtful. Then adding a red card to a legend like Buffon on top of that? Can't criticize Oliver for not having guts. He's going to take a lot of flak."
dx7eqza,fools_eye,Legend or not doesn't matter.
dx7etvu,Irctoaun,"The fact Buffon is a legend is totally irrelevant, he was shoving the ref and screaming in his face. Always gonna be a red"
dx7ez0f,Seithin,Didn't say it was relevant. I was saying that showing a player a Buffon's status a red card at that moment takes a lot of guts. Probably more so than any of the other players (bar Cristiano).
dx7ewce,redditguybighead,Now imagine not having replays and making the call as it happens.
dx7es0p,zackya89,Very brave in front of a cheering Madrid crowd lol.you sound like he was at Turin making this call
dx7er50,7evenStrings,"Was Buffon already on a yellow? Because the decision to send him off was absolutely fucking wank. Not like he physically threatened him, like understand it's a tense situation what the hell was the point of a straight red."
dx7g7ly,Gokuwaj1218,Grav and shove ref plus screaming in his face = always straight red
dx7e9en,smokestacklightnin29,What a fucking penalty.
dx7e8lx,ailurus2,Not like this...
dx7etk2,sosolastreethehe,Funny how absolutely NO ONE is happy for Real in this thread.
dx7m34q,Arshia42,Why would anyone other than madrid fans be happy to see them win? Theyve won the past two champions league trophies and are the biggest club in the world. No shit that most people dont want to see them win everything all the time.
dx7igxj,Swatieson,I am.
dx7pule,sebas8181,Me too thanks
dx8egx4,FPnigel,Same.
dx7w2i3,FallofGondolin,I am
dx8e2kc,Dr-Purple,<3
dx7fizh,mixolydi,"No one likes Madrid except Madrid fans, and rightly so."
dx7kxpr,deftoneslover,I don't mind Madrid.
dx7gebb,stoner_prime,*Rightly so*Why?
dx7gq1t,thefurnaceboy,"nobody likes the biggest team, its how it is, its how it should be."
dx8c3hx,Skalby,I love real even though im not a fan
dx8hx7r,AjaxFC1900,Nice try Florentino
dx8dopw,SunshineZz,"Been a Madrista since I was 4, am 20 now. I am more than happy, being the villain is always fun"
dx7gpsa,DareiosX,I'm very happy. Screamed at the tv in excitement and texted my juve friends to rub it in their face.
dx7foj7,JokeSportGuy,How could you be? One of the most entitled and successful teams in the world gets through on a last second pen? That's complete horse wash.
dx7fvol,GeekIsBigZ,It's not horse wash though because it was a clear penalty. He made the right decision. If he wouldn't have gotten fouled he probably would've scored anyways.
dx7ghd7,FearoTheFearless,"Bullshit, he wasn't gonna score. Bullshit end to the game."
dx7gmi4,GeekIsBigZ,"If he didn't get fouled he would've gotten the first touch to that ball, unless Buffon makes a miraculous save he would've scored. Clear foul, clear red on Buffon too."
dx94ahx,FearoTheFearless,Buffon was right in front of him ffs. The penalty is fine but you have to admit a penalty in the 92 is a shite way of ending this battle of a quarter final.
dx9bs5k,GeekIsBigZ,"What are you suggesting? That the ref shouldn't call it just because it's the last minute of the game? A penalty is a penalty. Period. Whether it's the first minute or the last minute of the game, he made the correct call.It's Benatia's fault for fouling him, now we'll never know if Vazquez would've scored or not, or if Buffon would've somehow saved it.If I was a neutral I wouldn't want a game to end on a penalty like that, but I'm not."
dx9ck7o,FearoTheFearless,I said the penalty was fine. Did you not read that part???
dx9dwb6,GeekIsBigZ,"Shite way to end the game or not, that's how it ended, and it was a crazy fucking ending at that."
dx7q4vk,sebas8181,I love how you can tell the future. You could have save us the butt clenching and told us we were gonna win already.
dx7gagz,ztch10,"Why Tf should we be. They have won two years straight. Fuck real and the refs for always helping them along the way, it never fails they get the go ahead foul in stoppage, it's never against them. Fuck the Turkish ref from the first game. And fuck cuadrado for missing that sitter last game that would have pushed us on. Also fuck Michael Oliver too while I'm at it."
dx8e138,Dr-Purple,You were literally thrown out of your League and stripped of League titles for rigging referees. Think before you talk.
dx8u49g,ztch10,When will you fucking daft idiots get it. Inter was more to blame than anyone else. Its called reporting. Its called news. You should look into before making yourself look like a dumbass. http://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/2364315/calciopoli-2006-italian-match-scandal-case-expires-after-nine-year-investigation10 year investigation yielded no actual proof of match fixing.
dx8vaoo,Dr-Purple,"Y so mad, Maria Theresa?"
dx8c5u3,Skalby,Lol Juve complaining about refs helping the opposition. Talk about irony
dx8u5mc,ztch10,great joke. except it wasnt . God why cant all of soccer catch the fuck up. http://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/2364315/calciopoli-2006-italian-match-scandal-case-expires-after-nine-year-investigation10 year investigation yielded no actual proof of match fixing.
dx9evmv,Skalby,What joke? Why do you think im referring to calciopoli?
dx7i4zr,CaanThief,Should of just took the pen shirtless
dx84qbv,JE_12,"Has someone actually ever done something like that? What would even happen, would he get a yellow card before the penalty kick? And what if he keeps playing without a shirt? Straight red?"
dx8avfs,flarept1,Disrespecting a referee? Yellow then double yellow? No penalty taken by him?
dx9dhz6,cake_flattener1,"Yellow card and told to put his shirt on before taking the pen. Sending off if he carries on regardless.It's in the rules, players have to wear all mandatory items of kit, which definitely includes a shirt."
dx7eati,BelDeMoose,"Correct decision on pen, right to send off Gigi, Oliver will get a lot of flak but he made the right decisions.What a game"
dx7ekdb,ofap,"Vasquez got pushed, correct call. Buffon pushed and shouted at the ref in frustration, correct call to send him off. People are just upset because of no comeback and because it is Buffon."
dx7ewgk,Galgenfrist,Pretty much
dx7o3bg,MikelWillScore,But the narrative
dx7n7v5,VicodinPie,Buffon to retire from football with his last match being a red?
dx7wmn2,clamdiggin,He's just emulating Zidane really
dx8c5e5,Chickachic-aaaaahhh,No headbutt from Buffon :(
dx7g39h,CptJashun,and because its Real
dx7gwyk,toosharchadha,No one cares about you everybody is angry or sad because it's Buffon.Edit:- I am not saying anything against real just stating my feelings so please stop the downvotesEdit:- Ok after so many of downvotes I think you want it to be about you.
dx7h601,CptJashun,"I wish the story was about Buffon, but there are a lot of salty people in here."
dx7hchm,toosharchadha,"Yeah agreed but I am just sad because it's Buffon and I am not even a Juventus fan, I support Liverpool and I seriously don't care about your team.(no offense)"
dx7i39s,OrigenNoahX,And bacause it is Ronaldo and Real Madrid
dx7nwlo,Stakoman,Finally some good comments around here. Damn
dx7zxxm,Cruyff14,"You speak truth my friend, but it was sad nontheless to see my childhood hero end his UCL career like that :("
dx7jopm,ZaltorTheMerciless,And because no one expects Bayern to have a chance against Real. Fuck
dx7f03u,ferrule1122,Correct pen. In no way is it an automatic red for pushing or shouting at the ref. That's retarded. That's the most obvious yellow I've ever seen.
dx7ff3q,UhPhrasing,"Shouting, to a degree, sure. But you can't put your hands on the ref."
dx7fgqp,Do_not_tempt_me,No red for pushing the ref? Think real hard about what you've just said.
dx7g013,RjHospe,Wasn't Ronaldo suspended at the beginning of the season for pushing the ref and everyone was in a agreement that you don't touch the ref?
dx7g0f6,kinginthenorthjon,"Ask Ronaldo,he got 5 match ban for that."
dx7fgv1,Heblas,Never seen someone push the ref from behind with considerable force and get a yellow.
dx7gfg4,agzz21,You're absolutely mad. Laying a single hand on a ref with some sort of aggression is an automatic red.
dx7gdh1,serafale,We have no idea what Buffon said. He could've said “I'm gonna murder your entire family” for all we know.
dx7jmix,MyNameIsSushi,Doesn‘t even matter what he said. The second you touch the ref in an aggressive manner you get sent off.
dx7iqjo,estoxzero,And do you want that the defender make a soft tackle in the area? Do you even watch football?
dx7m3it,ofap,Where did I say that? And what does that have to do with anything?
dx7g5g3,CaIIMeBones,"Iuno man, situations matter as well. The pen was enough, would you really cripple a team in a really important game like this where the goal matters by sending off the keeper? Definitely warrants a red but sometimes you have to let things slide."
dx7gnlp,Hortaleza,"Lol no you don't let things slide. A red card in the 1' is a red card in the 90'Imagine if Buffon saved it, he wouldn't have punished for his actions at all which would have been really poor from the ref"
dx7haz2,CaIIMeBones,"The foul wasnt carded, but Buffon yelling a little bit is a straight red? Michael Oliver's a pussy. I wrote that first one with no video, I finally found one and barely anything happened, what a joke. and its a pen, odds are stacked against the keeper anyways. You can definitely let things slide."
dx7hg09,Hortaleza,"Most replays didn't show the beginning when Buffon was pushing the ref, so I don't know if you saw it. Anyway verbal abuse is generally only a yellow, but getting physical is an automatic red card, and deservedly so. So there must have been more than just yelling"
dx7hyn5,CaIIMeBones,"Are you actually kidding? You call that pushing? Just cause hes body to body with him? I still say that ref is a pussy, honestly, to be that bothered that he's gonna send off the keeper for that? I understand if he 2 handed pushed him but he didnt."
dx7hdj2,jec0995,Buffon crippled his team by acting out
dx7im5r,CaIIMeBones,"You expect him to just be a robot? I'll agree, it was definitely a pen and Benatia is a fuckin dumbass, but unfortunately not everyone can be Puyol and keep calm and accept the call. Buffon definitely got heated by the fact that theyre up 3-0 and had a pen called against them, regardless if he knew it was a pen or not"
dx7euxn,benelchuncho,"Also the red is inconsistent as fuck, players always push or touch the ref"
dx7fef0,aneminemfan,What planet are you on?
dx7fy7r,Al_Mondega,Planet Buffon's Butthole.
dx7fxo8,ElGenioDelDub,Lol Ronaldo got a 4 game suspension for a light shove
dx7g0yz,Savage9645,The amount of aggression makes a difference. It's okay to put your hand on a refs shoulder or something while you're pleading your case but it's not okay to violently push the ref while (presumably) swearing at him.
dx7fffh,Rodsoldier,There are situations and situations. Ref analyzed the situation and made the right call by sending him off.
dx7eeyi,drunkelot,Agree he did great job this game.
dx7euq0,smallerk,Benatia should've had a yellow in the first half
dx7ipzq,cristiano10s,And a yellow for the foul. 100% a tap in for Vazquez if he doesn't get fouled.
dx7fph2,RichieFinn,Hes letting Ronaldo away with a lot of diving tonight. I understand hes constantly getting his ankles kicked etc but jesus stand up man you are 6 foot 2
dx7h1cg,desert40k,He was good on big decision but my god was he aweful handeling small things. Juve got away with a lot of small tackles and Real got away with constantly diving and acting.Ronaldo definitely should have seen at least 1 yellow for his poor attempts to get a pen. Sadly most refs never give cards for this.
dx7en2d,Purdy8TV,Agreed on this call for pen and red but how many dives was he going to let certain players away with lol
dx7ewwt,iceworlock2,That call was fine but honestly the rest of the game was shit.
dx7f3b1,zizx,"He missed a ton of calls, Benatia had like 30 fouls. Good on big decisions though."
dx7evw6,Kloncs,I do not understand how you guys see that as foul. He is only glancing Vazquez on the side. Football is a contact-sport.
dx7egeq,Glorounet,"Yeah, don't know what everybody is on about, this is a pen, and Buffon bailed out on his teamates. It's really sad that it ends this way."
dx7f2jc,19degreez,"Totally understand why he went absolute mental there, but he really should have kept his composure knowing he's their last hope of keeping the game alive. So unfortunately it had to end this way."
dx7m6tu,GreeklolManiac,"""Last hope to keep the game alive"" I mean that's a pen mate, it's a 90% chance it's a goal. The game is over at that point and Buffon flips"
dx7t1bg,MarquesSCP,"there's a 10% chance that game is not over. It's not that unreasonable.However if you do get sent off, even if your sub saves the penalty then you really screwed your team badly.I can understand Buffon but he still hurt the team"
dx8h0ia,GreeklolManiac,I agree. That penalty was really rough to give for Juventus though. They were getting fired up and starting to believe they could make it when the ref gives a penalty. It's like playing with someone's emotions. Referee could've easily not given that imo and no one would question him
dx7yczi,TheAlmightyMeow,"Talk about chance, Barca had 99% chance to quality to semi final lul"
dx8h1ti,GreeklolManiac,Yeah Roma had different ideas though. And we let them do whatever they wanted. That's what we get for getting too complacent
dx7it44,mrgonzalez,Is Buffon known for saving penalties?
dx7k1zk,19degreez,"Even if he wasn't, getting himself sent off and putting his team at a one man disadvantage in the event that their substitute does save the penalty is not any better."
dx7ewcg,73696d61776f,"People are just sick of seeing Spain winning, agree with you though"
dx7f48g,ArianaLovato_,Real Madrid win* Fuck them!
dx7f99c,73696d61776f,Cause the average reddit neutral was absolutely rooting for Barca yesterday right?
dx7gucz,A3xMlp,Barca and Real then. Don't think people mind the other Spanish teams.
dx7gf51,ArianaLovato_,Well the average football fan is a Barca Fan so...
dx7jemi,73696d61776f,I literally said neutral lol
dx7f2jk,flifthyawesome,r/soccer hates us so not that surprising that people are salty rn
dx7jka3,impim,"I think most of us agree that it a pen, Many just upset because it had to end like this not because it bullshit penalty call.This one is legit and sad for Juve."
dx7f5wy,scottishwhiskey,They're just mad because it's Madrid. Same circumstance on the other side and people would be praising him. Awful way to end the game but I think he had to call that there.
dx8hk95,Rotorwash7,It would have never be given on the other side in the 92nd minute.
dx7f5lv,MUSE_iC,People are just over enamored by the dream comeback of Juventus to realize that the ref made the correct call on both of those.
dx7epao,CuntyMcCuntFace1,Yeah what the hells up with the match thread? Does everyone on here just scream conspiracy when the fairytale we want doesn't happen?
dx7hkv1,Haqadessa,"If by ''everyone'' you mean 1% of everyone, then yes."
dx7fpt1,sosolastreethehe,"I think people are mostly disappointed to see Madrid go through, there aren't many comments arguing that it wasn't a penalty, and those who are get downvoted pretty bad"
dx7efzs,guccigirlswag,"Same, I thought it was absolutely the right call. So clumsy from Benatia to go through the back of Vazquez."
dx7etdm,off_by_two,"Terrible positioning, spotted the run way too late"
dx7ewm7,SteW-,"How did benatia not get sent off lol, if he calls it it is at least a yellow right?"
dx7fgfb,regaleeagle,"To be fair I was surprised that Oliver didn't give Benatia a second yellow for the foul. Was just thinking that if the pk is saved, that could have been a talking point as well."
dx7eqou,Bulgerius,Buffon was right there with a really good chance to make the save. No need for that.
dx7erb0,HennesVIII,I don't understand how it wasn't a penality. I thought the ref was great.
dx7encu,TheLarryMullenBand,"Yeah I hate Michael Oliver as much as the next person, but that was very good officiating all around at the end there."
dx7hc7z,DidYouFindYourIndies,"Just curious, why do you hate him? I know that it was him who sent off Di Maria when Arsenal knocked MU out of the FA Cup, but is there another reason? I really rate him, one of the few PL referees that seem to be level headed imo"
dx7h0ws,Simplifiedmadness,"Really fucking ballsy in that situation. Lots of referees would just bottle that because it's such a big decision. He stuck his neck on the line to make a decision that determines the tie with, effectively, the last kick of the game. In such an incredible situation as well. Great refereeing."
dx7epi6,LavenderClouds,"The anti-madridistas will be on full force for the next couple weeks, the pen is a pen 100% on every league/country."
dx7egse,GermanHabsFan,Agreed!
dx7eluz,LeoIsLegend,"I wanted Juve to win but can't complain about that decision, was a stupid tackle."
dx7f4f3,MalluRed,I'm just surprised to see that Michael Oliver has a spine after all.
dx7esz5,fiif,"I don't get why ref's bother, even when they're right they're fucking well wrong. What's the point in getting shit right when this is how fans react to it?"
dx7et0q,sinrakin,"I think it's definitely a penalty, but I don't think it would have been a goal had they not fouled him. I think Buffon makes the save in that situation. Juve fans should be angry with the defender for the challenge."
dx7eran,bustedracquet,Yeah Benatia isn't getting enough flak for his dumbassery.
dx7espl,_gastly,"Absolutely agreed, not sure why this sub is on the conspiracy train. Good calls on both accounts"
dx7eyrz,detinu,"People's emotions are running high right now. When they've calmed down tomorrow they'll see it much more clearly. Source: me, after every United game."
dx7f0vq,Kilen13,Given how fucking intense this match was I thought Oliver had a pretty great match. Knew there'd be a lot of fouls and calls for them but he gave players just enough leeway before cracking down with cards. I'm sure Juve fans will feel aggrieved in the moment but that is a fucking ballsy call to make in the 93rd minute.
dx7fuhg,ISCOREDwithISCO,He did an excellent job.
dx7g3e2,D_Ciaran,Italian TV is doing some amazing mental gymnastics to cry injustice. It's so good.
dx7gydw,seven_pm,"So far, majority seem to agree with his decision though."
dx7eyfy,Smithman,Except he didn't. When a man starts going down before contact is made it's not a foul.
dx7ehrl,morbuskid,"The penalty was questioanble to say the least, there was bearly contact and the Benatia was going for the ball. The red was absolutely disgraceful. Buffon didn't even use his hands to touch the referee or anything, he was just bumping into him a little in the hectic scenario. Oliver will get the flak he deserves for ruining the tournament for Juventus."
dx7eq22,AlphaQueueHard,"It looked like Gigi yelled slurs at Oliver, might be why he got the card."
dx7eqw1,Ozelotty,"Just don't fucking touch the referee. It's not that hard. Buffon deserved the red, he was clearly channeling Zidane here."
dx7fajq,Drumsticksboy,It was clearly a penalty. Benatia came from behind Vasquez and prevented him from playing the ball. Not sure what you saw.
dx7fq2m,nocturn-e,What are you watching? A soft foul in the box is still a penalty.
dx7erf4,YanksForTheWin,Yeah I mean he acted like he was hit by a truck but on the replay it didn't look like much contact at all.
dx7ehr8,elijscott,"Definitely disagree. That is an unbelievably soft penalty call, especially given the context. Gigi getting sent off is a moot point if it's a bad call."
dx7evqm,Quamme,"Context is completely irrelevant. If it's a free kick in the middle of the pitch, then it's a penalty as well."
dx7fbqf,0aniket0,"Apparently getting kicked in your head from behind is soft now, these are not 60s mate"
dx7enap,Chanceria,Vázquez fell even before any contact is done
dx7fb9b,ThePeleOfMissionary,"No. He doesn't even see Benatia coming. And Benatia never touches the ball. It sucks, but is has to be a penalty. It would be a free kick ten out of ten times."
dx7ffhe,Parasek129,"I completely disagree on the penalty. No idea about buffon, might have said something worth sending him off.But considering alot of people think its a penalty makes it a close call atleast, so I guess it's fine.."
dx7kxmu,,[deleted]
dx8cwna,Snoopyseagul,And that's why you're Not a professional referee.
dx7eprs,matinthebox,ref made the right call but Juve deserved to go through after this match
dx7ev1i,brownboy73,"It's a football game, not a Bollywood movie."
dx7f357,matinthebox,who would have deserved to go through if it were a bollywood movie? I did not watch the game with that question in mind.
dx7fgux,brownboy73,I just meant that it doesn't matter who deserved to go through. It's a 2 leg game. Everyone seems have forgotten that Madrid scored more goals than Juventus which is what matters (and also makes RM more deserved if it comes to that).
dx7g74f,matinthebox,"I mean maybe for you it doesn't matter who deserved to go through. But I also look at the football the teams play, not just at the result.Edit: And it just reeks of arrogance how Real gave away their 3-0 advantage, as if they weren't taking Juve seriously any more. For me that matters."
dx7fz1a,Marcoscb,Why doesn't RM deserve to go through after the first match?
dx7gc3k,matinthebox,because there is a second match to be played after the first one ;)
dx7f099,diegogt96,Til shouting at a ref gets you a red card. Wonder how south american games are even allowed to finish.
dx7ex7y,Sw4gg1n,"that is an incredibly light penalty to give when the decision is likely going to decide the game. i'm a juve fan, so i'm biased, but to give a penalty in extra time of tied game of this magnitude, surely the foul has to be clear and an awful one. worse fouls had been let go today. still an incredible game."
dx7f8l0,n10w4,"Though I'd like to see another angle, this looks pretty obvious: pushes from behind and doesn't touch the ball"
dx7fkkh,Sw4gg1n,"i'd also like to see an angle from the other side, and i agree it's a foul. i'm fine with that being given in midfield, but i feel giving an extra time penalty for it in such an exciting and nerve wracking game is wrong. let the players decide the game unless that foul is egregious."
dx7fdue,En_Panda,TIL If a referee is making the right decision but it favors Real Madrid. He ruined the game.
dx7ge8d,KingAn2903,"People were hoping for a Roma 2.0 game. I would like to see what people think about the decision in a day or 2, to let the anger and dissapointment get down."
dx7idtf,Namboman,"Expecting people to ever walk back hatred for Madrid is a lost cause. Just like Bayern, Barca, Man U of old, people hate when the top teams win"
dx7sweb,NotEnoughFire,"holy shit the amount of friends of mine blowin my phone tryna talk shit as if suarez didnt scum fuck psg last year...its a shame, i dont like when soccer brings out the negative fanaticism, so i do my best to just hold it back...gradeschool shit"
dx89i9p,triBaL_Reaper,"Who tf red cards a keeper right before a penalty kick though, jeez. If this wasn't such a prestigious league, I'd say that's as corrupt as reffing can get lol"
dx8b290,En_Panda,Who tf thinks that GK can say anything they want to the ref just because they are GK's?
dx8bwrr,Wnhs,He's the captain of the team if he doesn't back up his players who would? You?
dx8c0ct,En_Panda,Back up his players? By screaming shit and pushing the ref? If he's a captain he should remove all his players from the ref and then talk to the ref. Not that it would matter.
dx8c1zn,Wnhs,Instead of a heart you probably have a trash can.
dx8c5fe,StuntmanSalt,"Lol you can't just push the ref, Gigi fucked up"
dx8c7fl,Wnhs,Americans replying to me is like a McDonald's looking after for my eating habits
dx8cdb5,StuntmanSalt,"That's elitist, friend. Especially since I'm not wrong here, you are."
dx8c391,En_Panda,"Yes, it's me and Oliver mate."
dx7e8q0,MattJamesThirtySix,WHAT A PENALTY BY HARRY KANE
dx7epbx,TheLarryMullenBand,Curious to see how quickly /r/soccer will kill this joke.
dx7ewms,DocaHyper,.....and it's gone
dx7fczk,WalkingCloud,We've outgrown the Harry Kane joke.
dx7hrvw,ThrustTheProcess,Same thing for the bald fraud joke imo
dx7ezmr,Plasda,It's definitely already dead aha
dx7q7dy,konchikarta,I don't get it. What's the joke?
dx7fkxr,sneezyo,Rumour goes Kane is responsible for killing the joke.
dx7evzy,oysterpirate,it was dead about two days ago
dx7f9ku,expatbayern,But poor play by Harry Kane to concede the last-minute penalty.And just really unacceptable for Harry Kane to go after the ref and get the red like that.
dx9de45,cake_flattener1,Good decision by Harry Kane to send him off though.
dx7ic8a,SketchersOnMyFeet,Can someone explain where the hell this joke came from? Been seeing it everywhere. Did Harry take credit for a goal he didn't score?
dx7ig4p,MattJamesThirtySix,yea he took credit for eriksens great FK goal even though he was 5 yds away from touching it the goal was given to him and now he's a meme
dx7ek98,RenrutD,I'm already tired of seeing this shit
dx7ewbn,Marmozetto,Buckle up. It's gonna be done to death for the next 6 months by the r/soccer comedians
dx7fhau,tanu24,Lads its fuck /r/all and /r/sports HAHAHAHAHAHA
dx7hnnn,njuffstrunk,subscribe
dx7fnqq,brohara24,"6 months? I'd say a few years, at least."
dx7nhse,gooner712004,The thing about Harry Kane is he always tries to walk it in *God I'm funny*
dx7nsps,Marmozetto,"What was Kane thinking, sending Kane on that early....Oh god, I've become one of them!"
dx7fdp4,kingsleym17,"I don't understand it, but I hate it."
dx7l5k2,lcfcjs,"HAHA, I'm nowhere near seeing the end of it. It's even funnier seeing how pissed off it makes Spurs fans."
dx7ep60,Steelkatanas,DAUGHTER=ALIVE
dx7eqoe,DemonicSquid,Four goals in a game! Unreal!
dx7gfxj,BiggJj,I still think this is funny. Just sayin'
dx7fjpb,areyouhungryforapple,*appealing intensifies*
dx7gtqr,deathkilll,Someone explain this meme
dx7kcb7,DjMesiah,Probably cause he appealed to get credit for a goal that was given to Eriksen that he claimed to have touched
dx7kubh,deathkilll,🙏
dx7esf3,0aniket0,LEGEND!
dx7fh3l,xepa105,Swear on me daughter
dx7fa88,Dyalibya,You won't let this one die out?I like it
dx7ecn0,Ema919,What the heck are people talking about... that was a clear pen.
dx7f1tb,eth6113,People wanted Juve to win therefore it's not a penalty...
dx7gdx4,I_travel_for_work,Absolutely. I said all of that because I was very angry. Then I watched the replay again and saw what I didn't want to see the first time. Because I fucking hate this teeeeeeeammmmm. But yes it was a penalty
dx7tm87,Timboslice8801,"For all the clear penalty calls that refs miss it's really crushing to everyone who was pulling for a miraculous comeback to be brought back down to earth with a pen and a red card in added time. It's one of those UEFAlona, Bayerndussel, kind of things where, while legit in this case, feels rigged against Juve and for Real. I mean to lose 3-0 at home for Real is atrocious only to be bailed out by a last second penalty leaves everyone except Real feeling cheated."
dx7i7cg,OrigenNoahX,Umm why you hate them? Scared to face them? :D
dx8kqcq,dogilchingu,Because they are a mercenary team and always have been.
dx7gsdh,stinsonlegend,"Technically, Juve did win the game."
dx7j98w,merger3,If I was a Juve supporter I would be bitching about the ref til tomorrow even though I know it was a pen.What else can you even do.
dx7l21f,clitoris_paper_cut,1. Lie down.2. Try not to cry.3. Cry.
dx7fznw,nocturn-e,"Just the usual anti-Madrid comments. If this happened the other way, there would be no doubt it was a penalty."
dx7evbs,motez23,"not one person has said why it isn't, just a bunch of ""Robbed"" ""VAR"" ""Sad Juve got robbed like this"""
dx7gf4o,CantFindAUniqueOne,and some salty barca fans
dx7gje9,motez23,lol at least you're self aware
dx7ppvq,sebas8181,I think we found a unique one.
dx7j3ku,nekkidfauno,pretty salty myself tbh
dx7gkn0,TheMediumPanda,Are you claiming one or the other?
dx7h1tt,motez23,I'm making a statement
dx7m9ct,Castdeath97,Check CL twitter's reply and come back and tell me no one said it.
dx7hinx,jrey0707,"i can obviously see why it was called a pen, but in the replay it looks like hes going down before benatia gets to him. i just think its a tough call to make after climbing your way back all game. let the game play and take it to extras"
dx7iitr,motez23,you can't pick and choose when to follow the rules
dx7ju63,jrey0707,"which is why i pointed out that he was going down before benatia got to him. and saying you cant pick and choose is kind of bullshit. how many times have fouls been given/not given based on it being in the box? it happens all the time. pks are, generally speaking, harder to earn. i think it was a soft pk, and especially soft given the circumstances."
dx7ihk9,throwaway689908,That's now how the game works.
dx7fx94,Crot4le,Because it is simulation. The slightest of touches and he throws himself on the floor.
dx7h5dl,CaptainJingles,Two hands and then a knee to the numbers? Does he have eyes on the back of his head to time his simulation?
dx7kj43,AntiChr1st,There is no push and there is no knew to the back.He gets lightly touched and falls instead of making the best play he can.Should've gotten a yellow for filming
dx7kqum,CaptainJingles,You can see Vasquez's body move from being pushed at 0:27 of this video. Unless he guesses that he is about to get touched and reacts accordingly...while his back is to Benetia.
dx7l7dx,AntiChr1st,"He gets lightly tapped, you see more contact on every single corner and free kick ever taken in the history of the game. Are you seriously trying to claim that the Juventus defender is so strong he can send a grown man flying without even looking like he is trying? Either he is secretly Clark Kent or Vasquez dives because he sees a chance to play the ref instead of the game.I'm going with the diving explanation.Football will never be fixed until they do like hockey. If a player isn't actively trying to stay on his feet, book him for diving regardless of contact."
dx7m4kb,,> no push> no knee> lightly tappedhttps://streamable.com/ft51kTell us why being kicked in your ribs while the defender makes **ZERO CONTACT WITH THE BALL** isn't a foul anymore?
dx7n3q0,AntiChr1st,"You make it sound like he was full speed drop kicked by Vin Diesel flying out of a camarro.He is barely touched. That isn't painful, it doesn't have any effect on you, you would barely notice if someone did that to you right now. He gets touched and falls down screaming in a way that my 7 year old niece would find embarassing, he does it because he sees a chance to manipulate the ref over playing the game. It's a contact sport, that means there is contact. If a small child is tougher than he is then I suggest he change careers for something more fitting his pain tolerance. Though that might be difficult considering he seems to be more fragile than an uncooked egg."
dx8dxof,,"He doesn't need long contact with the push. It needs to be impactful. Do you not know how physics works.Benatia was charging at him with momentum and gave him a shove. That's what threw him off balance. Pause right after the push and you see his head flying forward.> That isn't painful, it doesn't have any effect on you, you would barely notice if someone did that to you right now. > He gets touched and falls down screaming in a way that my 7 year old niece would find embarassingYep I'm sure you and your 7 year old niece would be fine after Benatia kicked you guys in the ribs. Good job mate."
dx8f6i3,AntiChr1st,"> He doesn't need long contact with the push. It needs to be impactful. It's not impactful either, barely touches him.> I'm sure you and your 7 year old niece would be fine after Benatia kicked you guys in the ribsIf the kick is like that anyone will be fine. It's not a roundhouse kick by a pro muay thai fighter, he moves his leg sideways and inwards towards himself while moving in the opposite direction, it's completely impossible to generate any force like that."
dx8g2yz,,"> It's not impactful either, barely touches him. It's like you didn't read the post. You're only even saying this because of how slowed down the clip is. Also I can tell you're confused because there's 0 correlation between force impact and how long Benatia touched him. It could've been for 0.1 seconds and it'd still be irrelevant. Literally the only way of judging impact here is looking at the reaction afterwards. And you can see Vazquez's head immediately fly forward. No unnatural movements.> If the kick is like that anyone will be fine If you cannot understand why kicking someone in the rib is a foul then there's no point continuing. Just watch the same link in a few days when you're less frustrated. The fact that virtually the whole thread is disagreeing with you is telling."
dx7gps6,Walmartsavings2,"This is true honestly. The contact is very, very, weak. He definitely makes contact but it's still a simulation and Juventus doesn't get that call ever."
dx7ka6t,MyNameIsSushi,"> The contact is very, very, weak.Any kind of contact in combination with a dangerous play is a penalty within the box. Doesn‘t matter what kind of contact."
dx7hfcc,kumblast3r,"Vazquez doesn't even make an attempt to play the ball, he's clearly just baiting the contact. Anyone who's played knows he went down so easily."
dx7ge24,iDrownNerds,You have to realize this sub is a Ronaldo hate circle jerk. They love to see him fail.
dx7f71u,LocostarX,ITT: A bunch off butthurt people lol.
dx7g2s1,drotoriouz,I am indeed butthurt.
dx7ezwe,FuujinSama,"This sub is so weird. It's never a foul unless someone's bleeding. Jump kick a player ""why is that a red card, not even a yellow in my book, he's trying to play the ball."""
dx7eyle,SirPoliwhirl,"Yeah I'm really surprised reading all the reactions. I was rooting for Juve, but come on."
dx7g8no,,[deleted]
dx7hk1s,SirPoliwhirl,"Yeah luckily everything is sorting out right now. But you should have seen the match thread, once it had been created. 'Robbed', 'shitref' etc."
dx7g0gu,SirWosko,"Italian TV showing """"exclusive footage"""" that shows that benatia touches the ball, salt is real lol was clearly a pen.."
dx7gdlh,Ema919,"I'm watching it and I'm calling bullshit, the image doesn't show that the ball hits the foot, and Benatia hit Vazquez's back with his body and his chest with the foot. I'm saddened by this because I wanted Juve to go through, but it just looked clear to me."
dx7gdzq,2400gbot,">I'm sadHere are a few funny [cat pictures](https://imgur.com/a/eqX4F) for you /u/Ema919, to cheer you up!___^^hello, ^^I'm ^^a ^^bot ^^and ^^this ^^action ^^was ^^performed ^^automatically ^^for ^^questions ^^pm ^^me. ^^[Source](https://github.com/maumau35/2400gbot)"
dx7ggdz,Ema919,good bot
dx7f6ld,Yankee_Gunner,Whoa whoa whoa... Get outta here with your logic
dx7ip9n,nutmeggerking,"That's a correct observation (it was a pen), not logic. You are using this in the wrong situation, mate."
dx7krw6,Yankee_Gunner,Thanks for your input
dx7f62t,pesek34,There are actually very few who said that here.
dx7j71b,amalgamatedchaos,"Late to this post, but I'll admit it... I didn't think it was a pen. It's one of those calls where it might be easy to call anywhere outside the box b/c the consequences aren't as high, but we see this kind of thing all the time. It's a bit too soft in my opinion to affect a whole tournament over.I mean you could probably break down where his hand is, his leg, his knee, and how it affected Vazquez; but Vazquez also goes down way too easily. The defender makes the play, gets the ball. The contact that was made wasn't harsh enough to be called a foul imo. It's still a contact sport. There, I said it."
dx7knhz,AntiChr1st,> Vazquez also goes down way too easilyI still say football should copy the diving rules from hockey.If you aren't trying to stay on your feet you should get booked for diving.
dx7mnca,Wutzer,How would you handle this situation? Vazques goes down easily but it was still a (soft) penalty. Give Vazques a yellow but still award the penalty? Can it be a foul and diving?
dx7nq35,AntiChr1st,"In hockey they can do both. It goes under embellishment. Basically the ref says ""yeah it was a foul, and we're taking him for that, but you're being a bigass fucking baby about it so you're going too"" (also because it's hockey they're allowed to use grown up language, so the ref might actually say exactly that).In this particular case i don't think it's a penalty at all. Vasquez falls because he wants to fall, it has nothing to do with the contact made. The contact is not noteworthy, it doesn't make Vasquez fall, it's not dangerous, it's not painful... Fotball is supposed a contact sport, you see much harder contact than this on every single free kick and corner. The level of contact that is allowable should remain constant throughout the game."
dx7f7f8,Pdeedb,"All day every day is that a pen, and Buffon went way way way overboard and frankly I think that's a red. Two tough, big calls for the ref and he got them spot on. Aside from that what a pen from Ronaldo. Incredible."
dx7f8l9,EdgeFC,"They're talking out of frustration, r/soccer desperately wanted Juve to go through. I understand some comments, others (like saying ""disgusting"" or ""not a penalty"") I simply don't but whatever I guess."
dx7g7k0,XooV,"The vast majority are saying it was the right call.. Including me, but I think it's stupid to say it was a ""clear pen"". It was pretty light contact that often wouldn't get called."
dx7ga55,Ema919,light contact? He assaulted his back
dx7gg9s,XooV,"You've got to be kidding. Slight pushes like that happen all the time all over the field and are very often not called fouls when they should be. It was not a very hard push.. but call it ""assault"" if you want"
dx7gt34,Walmartsavings2,Exactly! It's not nearly as clear as people are saying. That happens on EVERY FUCKING CORNER ever. Never called.
dx7hzbo,k1k13,Yeah but this is literally a clear goalscoring chance. Corners are not really a 99% goalscoring chance
dx7grjy,Ema919,"That was not a slight push... Benatia jumped and had the higher half of his body over Vazquez, then he put his hands on the Madrid's player's back and put all the weight of his body on him because of that. I understand all the hate about this, but it's mostly saltiness in my opinion, that was a pen and if it happened for your team you would've said it was. Edit: I thought I was responding to the one saying it wasn't a pen, sorry about the last part."
dx7kx3p,Walmartsavings2,We would absolutely never ever ever get that call vs Madrid in the final minute to bail us out.
dx7h3wp,XooV,I guess we just disgree about how forceful it was.. that kind of contact happens in the box on basically every corner and isn't always or even usually called. I just wouldn't call it a clear or easy decision
dx7exjq,A_Bit_Of_Nonsense,But Real were the *baddies!*
dx7kipm,I_AM_ALWAYS_WRONG_,"Was a pen, but we all know they wouldn't pay the same pen to knock out Barca/Madrid. That's the problem. You would have to take someones head off to have a game deciding penalty go against you as a Barca/Madrid player."
dx8d4o5,Rudi_Reifenstecher,no it really wasn't
dx7ffdu,Dyalibya,"Indeed , it's a penalty"
dx7irt3,estoxzero,"No it wasn't, maybe to your soft football yeah"
dx7iula,Ema919,"Italian football is all but soft dude, lol."
dx7jb6i,estoxzero,Shut up and hope that the referee doesn't give a hand to real Madrid vs Roma
dx7jhle,Ema919,"It's not like we got much of a chance in the case anyway, even today Real deserved to score at least 1."
dx7kf0q,estoxzero,"You are in better form than juve, and your dt is better than allegri"
dx7eeal,Koooshlover69,How are people seriously questioning that penalty call?
dx7esyr,mattwillyz,I think everyone was just pulling for juve and was gutted at the outcome.I was pulling for them hard and I hate Madrid but it was a good call. Regardless of that I still found myself calling it bullshit these last ten minutes lol
dx7fnvn,AlphaQueueHard,As soon as they lost I remembered I hate Juve too so it's not so bad hahaha
dx7fxe8,mattwillyz,Crazy how that works huh? Madrid will do that to ya
dx7fa90,JokeSportGuy,"It's one of those ""good"" calls. Soft enough to be total bullshit, but there was contact and well."
dx7fdvv,mattwillyz,"Yeah. I have to believe that with the way Madrid gets so many generous calls in CL, that players would be a bit more cautious in a situation like that. Was reckless by Benatia, but at the same time he had to at least try to make a play"
dx7g32k,adrenalinemusicguy,You were pulling for juve because Woy
dx7g48u,mattwillyz,Not gonna lie I was hoping he saved that pen haha
dx7g6fa,adrenalinemusicguy,"Yea and in the post match interview, he'd say: fuck Itally, I'm comming home, Wonga!!"
dx7fc2s,tastetherainbowmoth,"jea it was a pen, but ref come on, dont give a red, and why wasnt he playing that extra-extratime"
dx7fkuf,mattwillyz,Buffon must have said some heinous shit to have gotten a red. Curious to see what he says post game. Idk how people are already hopping on the “le classless Gigi” train when they're not entirely sure what happened minus a lot of screaming
dx7fnuz,gonnacrushit,"he didn't say shit, he manhandled the ref"
dx7fsop,tastetherainbowmoth,"he had his mouth open but was pushed from behind on the ref, and the ref kind of only sees buffon all over him and reacts instantly and gives him red. I think if he just shouted he might have gone away with yellow, but that push got him red. unfortunately it wasnt even his fault really"
dx7j2uw,fistymcbuttpuncher,"Only reason I was hoping Juve would pull it off is for the RM fan meltdowns, but then again, fuck Juve :(RM just won CL."
dx7fkpa,spanish787,"Lmao my friends are bombarding me saying that it wasn't a pen, ref was paid...Clear pen to me"
dx7iq2c,LeftHookTKD,No way that's a pen. There was barely an contact. The madrid player fell down WAY too easily and this is exactly what makes a lot of people not take our sport seriously.
dx7p3tt,kurchak31,"I actually agree. How anyone thinks it is a CLEAR pen is beyond me, it is very much in the Grey area. In my mind it's no pen. Hands resting on his back as a normal part of play, no shove, no touching to disrupt his balance, was falling before any contact. No pen and I'm no juve fan."
dx7r9bk,LeftHookTKD,Yeah I obviously am not a Juve fan and that pen still made me furious. You can't give that kind of pen in the last seconds of a tie game in the UCL.
dx7fj0w,SureSure1,We are not questioning the call. It's just that it's a sad ending to a great match that looked liked it was gonna come down to who had spirit. The ref blue-balled us from witnessing that.
dx7g4gb,NaughtyProwler,"The reverse angle they showed for like 1.5 seconds on BT. Thats why. Honestly, VAR would solve the whole thing though regardless of what we think. Too bad it's not in yet."
dx7h8qr,smala017,From some angles (that any person with a brain can tell you are useless angles because you're screened from the contact) it has the appearance of a soft call. But the television angle makes it clear that there was a push in the back.
dx7fmfk,Hispanicwhitekid,"I mean idk. I'm American so I'm used to rougher sports, like you can't wrap your leg around him obviously, but he goes down so damn easily. Weaker penalties have been given tho."
dx7egmd,W0666007,Yeah... he pushed through him and kicked him up around the side. In what world is that not a penalty? He even puts two hands on his back (seen at 27 seconds of the video).
dx7focj,Chanceria,Vázquez fell way before any contact is made
dx7g73p,W0666007,"I mean... no? https://a.pomfe.co/ouxwy.mp4You can see him standing upright at 27 seconds as the defender is extending his arms into him, and then he falls forward. Clear penalty."
dx7h0j5,Chanceria,Beneatia goes like a retard but barely touches him. Fall like a piece of paper.
dx7insu,MyNameIsSushi,Because kicking someone in the chest without touching the ball is completely within the rules.
dx7jxp2,Chanceria,He doesn't do that? He comes from behind more less like a retard but barely touches him. This is football not ballet. if the ref gonna give a foul for every shoulder shock we would have fouls everyone time Ronaldo touches the ball
dx7k70v,MyNameIsSushi,He does. A dangerous play in combination with *any kind of* contact within the box is a penalty. If there‘s no contact but still a dangerous play then that would result in an indirect free kick inside the box rather than a penalty.
dx7ec1z,Dincht04,Clear pen. Stupid defending and utterly awful positioning in the first place from Benatia.Cracking penalty as well.
dx7fi93,Ale_Hodjason,Agree with you %100. If he hadn't done anything I don't think real would score honestly.
dx7ib0k,Waylaand,"Agree and the worst thing about it is hes not even going for a header hes trying to chest it down, could have saved that :/"
dx8kn25,krylosz,Benatia was on his way back from helping out on the right wing. I don't know how he could have been in a better position. It was Matuidi who let completely gives up the center and stands around watching the rest of it play out.
dx7fsnr,Haevollgutoder,"The bad positioning was Alex Sandros fault, not at all on Benatia. Sandro completely fucked their defensive line"
dx7f8wr,BirdOfHermess,I really don't think so. Lucas was already really quick to fall even without contact before. Real was fishing for pks.
dx7g2t0,fake_lightbringer,"Penalty or no penalty, this was no dive. Benatia gets more than enough of him to make him fall."
dx7h73f,TheMentallord,"It was a clear push. Why would he dive there, with such a good opportunity to score? Buffon was beaten, the defenders were beaten, no reason to dive there at all."
dx7el9o,msdsc2,where are you when /r/soccer died
dx7f9l5,dekszter,-sitting at home watching fairytales-barcelona rings-juve is die-no
dx7ezog,Muslim_Pulisic,Buffon is kilNo
dx7ptsg,sebas8181,"Which year? 2016, 2017 or 2018?"
dx7f8fz,DippStarr,"At first look in full speed it appears to be a rock solid no call of a foul. After watching it through about 5 times you can see Benatia give Vasquez a shove, then come through him, and then kick him in the chest with a leg rap, all actions missing the ball. The only call on that play was a penalty. Damn shame Benatia had to blow it like that."
dx7hj3e,Nuwanda84,Is there a better penalty taker? He's razor sharp.
dx7e855,ekoth,fuck off
dx7f0jd,tapped21,Inb4 Bayern Real semi final
dx7gavk,Unban_Ice,Yes please!
dx7ix3g,Ab_Stark,Yes please!
dx8i4r2,Unban_Ice,"Feeling strong because you could win against juve with a 98th minute penalty? Now I want it even better, just to laugh on you afterwardsGood luck"
dx91qk7,Ab_Stark,Why so serious mate? It's just banter
dxao9oo,Unban_Ice,"Seems like either of us will be right after all, even if it was banter or not"
dx7ewfn,PastryDish,The salt lol. It was definitely a penalty too
dx7f5fx,zidaninho10,Absolutely fair goal.
dx7fzp3,diggsoutforstefon,juve won that game. the audacity ronaldo has to rip off his shirt after scoring the pen like they fucking deserve this.
dx7g60x,Criym_Rl,What are you on about ? Real still won the first leg and they deserve to go through
dx7goye,diggsoutforstefon,juve came back away and scored 3 unanswered goals. tremendous dive by vasquez to send them through though mate. ronaldo needs a lesson in humility. madrid played like utter shite all game and they get lucky in the last minute and he rips off his shirt like a horny little college girl.
dx7h09b,pizzaguy953,who hurt you lmao
dx7q64n,pianoftw,"Here, in his natural habitat. The armchair American who has never kicked a ball in his life."
dx7q8ps,diggsoutforstefon,"lol, ODP player throughout my teens. thanks though!"
dx7gg0e,RZAAMRIINF,> the audacity ronaldo has to rip off his shirt after scoring the pen like they fucking deserve this.We won 4-3. We deserved this.

dx7eu83,Kurvco,Classic fucking Penaldo
dx7evfu,Albertcore,"Same Shit as last year with you guys, I'm in shock"
dx7f57a,sidhantsv,Only that the decision tonight was actually right
dx7fe11,Mktwoo,"Why on Earth is this guy downvoted? All emotions aside, that is a penalty no matter what way you look at it ."
dx7fr2e,Majormlgnoob,sports subs tend to hate the top teams
dx7gwzw,A3xMlp,I'm seeing far more people supporting the decision than those opposing it. Compare that to some local sites here in the ex-Yu and people are going mental. The comments are glorious.
dx7gcpf,bamadeo,"i wanna see other angles but in my opinion (downvotes come to me) it's not a pen, that contact, in any other part of the pitch isn't a foul. That said, stupid positioning from Benatia and even worse by Alex Sandro, he should've gotten CR7 offside"
dx7hxlo,Zack_Fair_,honestly I don't blame people agreeing with you. it's obvious Real practices flops and that one was a beaut'
dx7fcih,,[deleted]
dx7fh6h,AzeiteGalo,I think you mean salt mate.

dx7ftkr,rishijoesanu,Who cares. Fuck Real Madrid
dx7fza8,sidhantsv,Cheers
dx7fqtd,Chocoschism,"Getting really tired of this.Yes we scored 2 offside goals in ET vs Bayern, but their goal that put the game to ET was offside.And before someone brings up Casemiro, Vidal should have been sent off either with an insta red for his challenge on Isco at the start of the game or with a second yellow for another bad challenge on Casemiro in the 48th minute.The ref was terrible for both teams."
dx7g9lo,I_travel_for_work,"Give it up, and let us be mad. It's not that big of a deal. You still won."
dx7gd52,Chocoschism,Aight that's fair
dx7gi9q,RamboLeon,Ye but Vidal was Sent off and casemiro Wasnt While both should have been off the field. You cant keep a straight face and say real isnt getting gifts every season in the important games.
dx7go94,Chocoschism,"Vidal should have missed 85' minutes of the game. 45' if for some reason you think his challenge on Isco wasn't a red. Casemiro should have missed 10, and let's not forget your offside goal. If anything we got the worst of it before the ET."
dx7h065,RamboLeon,"Keep argueing you monk, offside goal in the final one year, clear dive gives you a Penalty the other.Just fuck off. Madrid is „lucky“ every game that doesnt go their way. If Madrid win the Champions League this year the competition doesnt mean shit anymore. Watch the game either the spanish team is better and they Will Never be unlucky or the spanish team is worse and then play with 12 men."
dx7h3rz,Chocoschism,"[Alright friend, have a nice day.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)"
dx7hrmy,RamboLeon,"Go celebrate your win with the other Madrid fans, if you actually Support the Club. I bet you just sit in your room and Stream the game illegally and Chose Madrid as your team so you can feel good about yourself.You dont know what real Emotions in football are and how should you if you dont even know how the game Works. Everyone who Ever played a game of football knows that it wasnt a Penalty."
dx8irqd,zaedaus,Apply butthurt cream
dx7htxd,Chocoschism,there there
dx7f5bt,MacGooder,"I really want to play these guys, but then again not really"
dx7jlmn,Vipi,"Hate him all you want, but he's the only guy you want taking that pen"
dx7goxy,xeneize93,That was a fair penalty any day but damn it saddens me :/
dx7fsuq,raj3sh1,Even buffon wouldnt be able to save that
dx7fzrb,trendy_traveler,"If you look closely, Benatia pushed Vazquez in the back using his right arm. He really didn't need to do that. Stupid decision since ref was right behind him and must have seen that clear as day."
dx89aqh,HenryHenderson,"Crazy how in the end, Buffon was the only one to blame really.Benitia had to make the challenge to prevent pretty much a certain goal - no blame.Vasquez was tackled unfairly imo with the challenge, didn't dive - no blame.Buffon got in the refs face and pushed him - blame.Ronaldo slotted home perfect penalty under intense pressure - no blame.Szczesny had no chance to save penalty - no blameSad it had to end that way but Oliver got it right all around. Maybe he could have took discretion with the red card but according to the laws of the game, he had to."
dx7efab,Irctoaun,I know it doesn't fit the narrative but Oliver got that right. Very clear shove in the back for the pen then Buffon pushes Oliver multiple times which will always be a red
dx7gv4k,TheMediumPanda,Screaming into the ref's face like a madman ( the replays are not kind to Buffon) ought to have been enough for a red. Embarrasing spectacle and Juve should probably have had 2-3 players sent off.
dx7gv35,krisburturion,Unless you play for Madrid or Barca you mean.
dx7g2p6,smala017,I'd like to see another angle on the foul. The ones we have now are inconculsive because you can't see the attacker's back.I'd also like to see push on Oliver. I haven't seen a video yet of what Buffon did.
dx7geg3,Irctoaun,"Buffon is very aggressively walking into Oliver, essentially pushing him with every step, all while screaming in his face"
dx7gnxr,smala017,That's what everyone's saying. I'm not questioning the call I just want to see the whole video.
dx7ex7z,DriizzyDrakeRogers,"That wasn't a shove. He barely makes contact with his back and as soon he does, the other guy is going down. He flopped hard, the ref just wasn't in position to see it."
dx7gb53,Irctoaun,Watch the final angle again. The Real player's body goes forward before his head because of a shove in the back. You can't really fake that
dx7en8z,mattwillyz,Where were you when Gigi was kill

dx7go2q,zidaninho10,You stfu. We won fair as fuck.
dx7f7ha,Lorenzo_Insigne,Nah.
dx7f3f6,TylerStreetSoap,Agreed
dx7hucg,Chrisnyc47,Why is it that people think Buffon was entitled to the CL. Football does not owe any player anything. They have to go out and win/earn trophies and he should've kept his cool. Had he kept his cool he probably would've had a chance to save that penalty.
dx7itge,Faizan24839,I completely agree with you but man ain't no one stopping that penalty
dx7jhm3,Chrisnyc47,"That was a cannonball, but still I think there would've been a slight chance that the outcome would've been different with Buffon as opposed to Szczesny"
dx7ec0g,idunlikeu,What's with this outrage? It's a clear penalty for me.
dx7fhcf,0aniket0,"Anti-ronaldo squad back at it again, now wait and watch them cry for every single minute Madrid plays in CL this season"
dx7frvu,The-Disco-Phoenix,"The replays I saw weren't great but to me it looked like LV went down really easily, and was already preparing to go down before the contact came"
dx7fvvi,idunlikeu,"He surely made the most of it, but there was a definite contact. And it was enough to warrant a penalty."
dx7estd,,[deleted]
dx7ew3h,idunlikeu,"Of course it is a fucking red card, you can't go in the ref's face like this, get a fucking grip."
dx7gdmv,silkysmoothjay,Or shove him.
dx7i14h,N7even,The ref was being bumped into and shoved. Straight red on any occasion.
dx7g67m,TheMediumPanda,"People who claim that it wasn't a penalty AND that Buffon shouldn't have been sent off are either extremely biased or idiots, period."
dx7gm54,arcbound_worker,Good example of why referees have a thankless job. It's a stonewall penalty but because it ruined an epic comeback people are twisting themselves into knots to say that it wasn't one.
dx7hhft,TheMediumPanda,"I'm involved in youth sport as well. Seeing such behaviour from grown up men, crowding the ref, shouting into his face, pushing him, completely losing control is extremely detrimental to fostering good, respectful behaviour with the kids. At least if the subject comes up, I can remark that Buffon received a well-deserved red card."
dx7qat7,sebas8181,"Totally agree. This gotta be one of the most ballsy right decisions I've ever seen, yet 50% of people will disagree with it."
dx7iwf2,AnFd,Why cant they be both?
dx7htnr,wizkatinga,I don't think it was a penalty and I think Gigi deserved to be sent off
dx7he3j,Rubalf,"I would actually argue it wasn't a pen, for the simple fact that he was already on his way down to try and header that ball. But fuck, like it matters at this point"
dx7i12u,i-went-full-retard,"The red card was absolutely right and deserved. But the penalty wasn't that clear. It's not that every contact in the box warrants a penalty. For me it wasn't. Juventus is extremely unlucky in the CL. See the referee's decisions in the previous game, or in the games Bayern vs Juventus in CL a couple of years ago."
dx7y4mw,visrian,"The greatest testament to Ronaldo: When people say “Ronaldo” these days, they mean CR7. You almost definitely have to say “the other Ronaldo” to refer to the Brazilian Ronaldo. And this is not recency bias."
dx8m016,wumbo105,"Of course it's recency bias. Sure he's great but he's the one that's actually currently playing. Common sense dictates when you say the name of a player, you're referencing the active one since he's currently relevant, and naturally have to specify if not. Let's not make up random shit for fun."
dx7iznd,makhan27,This is number one bullshit *khabib voice*
dx7egbf,JoeNapoli97,"In my opinion Michael Oliver made all the right decisions there, you can't talk to a ref like that and get away with it"
dx7fr9s,UhPhrasing,"I don't think shouting at him, to a degree, is red card worthy. He did however put his hands on Oliver and that's unacceptable."
dx7h56p,TheMediumPanda,"Fuck mate,, look at the replays. He's going mental, screaming into Oliver's face inches away for half a minute. Red for that sort of behaviour is necesary."
dx7hni8,UhPhrasing,"""using offensive, insulting or abusive language and/or gestures""Is from IFAB, so you're not wrong, I just think unlike actual fouls, some context is necessary when it comes to words. These are emotional situations so there needs to be a little more slack."
dx7gm22,JoeNapoli97,"Shouldn't treat a ref like that, footballers need to learn to treat referees with respect, no matter what decision. Especially should not shout and touch them like Buffon did"
dx7i1fx,chinookk,"I thought he had a really good game, I'm happy for him. I can't think of a mistake he made and he never disrupted the flow of the game. He's one of the reason the game was so entertaining imo."
dx7gtpx,Elros_of_Numenor,"his only mistake was not giving Benatia his second yellow, even though it didn't make much difference."
dx8o61x,donvito39,Buffon would never even have gone up to the ref with that attitude if it was someone like Pierluigi Collina
dx8qiv4,JoeNapoli97,To be fair Collina has a reputation of being the best ref of all time though
dx8uvzf,donvito39,And would have glared the fuck down any player who decided to shove him.
dx8xakq,JoeNapoli97,lmao that dude does look scary as fuck
dx7fnpf,adidasfootballer,Your ass acting like you heard what he was saying. Clear pen. The red was too much.
dx7gmsr,BullyBall,"He could've told him ""great decision ref, appreciate you"" and it wouldn't have mattered, he got in his face and laid his hands on him, you just don't do that"
dx7gqdu,zimtrovert94,"“I AM IN LOVE WITH YOU, MICHAEL!!”*gives red card*"
dx7lhom,adidasfootballer,"To be honest with you, show bob and vagene"
dx7gn1n,JoeNapoli97,Buffon's reaction was unnecessary
dx7edur,guccigirlswag,"Unpopular opinion: I thought that was the right call? Benatia went right through the back of Lucas Vazquez, clearly pushing him? Edit: When I posted this comment the majority of other comments were reactionary ""NO PENALTY"" ragers"
dx7ekbw,wafino1,"clear pen, I wanted Juve to win so bad, but Benatia just went full retard there."
dx7f2b7,Plasda,"Not full retard, he absolutely has to try otherwise he scores and they go out. It was a pen though."
dx7f4uh,puddingbrood,"Let's be honest, it was a goal if he hadn't pushed him anyway."
dx7gd32,finne_rm,The ball was actually pretty hard to take. Buffon stood right in front of him and the ball came directly on his chest.
dx7fg85,wafino1,"I can't honestly say, I think Vasquez bottles it personally."
dx7fb9w,firechaox,"He did it last ten minutes, completely lost his cool. Could've gotten a red earlier too, as when he got the yellow he had just done two cynical fouls that would not have been strange for each to have gotten a yellow if they hadn't been done one after another (in different periods of the game)."
dx7gyw8,RicardoLovesYou,You can tell he knew it too
dx7eyqv,A_Bit_Of_Nonsense,Lmao the entire thread is full of people saying it was the right call.
dx7ethl,forsakenpear,"not at all unpopular, it just feels unfair on Juve"
dx7ew7s,Ozelotty,Not an unpopular opinion. Definitely a penalty and I believe only the loud minority will disagree.
dx7fi22,Rodsoldier,Mad fans(most not even Juve fans) made it feel like it was unpopular for the first minutes.
dx7g0ml,Ozelotty,"I get it, it's kind of anticlimactic. But the call was right, it would have been a goal if Benatia didn't clatter Vasquez from behind."
dx7esfq,cbruce11,It's for sure a pen.
dx7ijka,Namboman,"It does seem like there's a lot of the 2nd wave of ""u popular opinion"" type comments in here without the 1st wave vitriol that they're a response to. Maybe the game or post match thread was different"
dx7gccv,XooV,lol how is that an unpopular opinion?
dx7ez6l,mercurialsaliva,"Look at the top comments, everyone agrees with you. (except for me, real unpopular opinion: shouldn't have been a penalty)"
dx7fft4,DriizzyDrakeRogers,"Not going to say whether or not it was the right call by the ref because idk what he saw, but that was barely a push. Smart play by Vazquez though to draw the foul though."
dx7fmwd,MUSE_iC,Its just unpopular right now bcs the people in this thread are still over enamored with the Juve and Buffon CL dream.Juve played amazingly well but Buffon and Benatia lost the plot there. Man I cant imagine being in Ronaldos place during that penalty the pressure would be immense and he goes and places it top corner.
dx7fx03,kingkreep95,How is that an unpopular opinion haha
dx7gu8d,Brucho,Unpopular: yes. Was it the correct call? Yes on both the pen and the card.
dx7gvq2,Kitnado,That's the most popular unpopular opinion I've ever read
dx7p81i,churrosricos,Not unpopular on reddit. Twitter is losing its shot though
dx7f311,anderspeterj,from the us?
dx7errl,GunsvsButter,Only unpopular because you're on /r/soccer and the call was for Madrid
dx7ffe6,pirlogod21,It's not even an unpopular belief lmao have you looked at the thread
dx7eyr5,JohnSwanFromTheLough,Why is it always Madrid fans moaning about /r/soccer
dx7fjy1,Rodsoldier,"But to be fair he is right. I don't think i've seen a single JUve fan complaining yet, mostly MU fans."
dx7g0cb,NoSoyTuPotato,ManU flairs and Barca flairs mostly up in arms in this thread. Juve fans mostly sad to see Buffon go that way.
dx7f6zl,ArianaLovato_,Cause they have a victim complex
dx7ffcd,Souless419,"The kick to the chest was bad, but theres no way that was a push. He was mid dive and the idiot kicked him in the chest to make his dive actually a penalty lol. Penalty should have been taken by the guy who got fouled too. Oh well. Shitty end to buffon career"
dx7f0ad,Oelingz,"It's not unpopular. Real doesn't deserver to go through, but the pen is so fucking obvious in real time and confirmed with the replays... Shame Buffon had to yell in the refs face like that while touching him, the red is right but it's still sad to see him go like this."
dx7e83h,Hentzup,I'm disgusted...
dx7fcf8,rezwah,After the reffing in the City/Liverpool game - how can you be disgusted by a ref not bottling a decision and make two correct calls in a vital moment?This isnt the Juve show - two teams in this game and both deserve to be treated fairly.
dx7ew7a,137-451,"Yeah, terrible decision from both Benatia and Buffon"
dx7ffw2,Chukmag,"Benatia almost got there, if he didn't challenge it would've been a goal for sure."
dx7gaoy,KaizerTitus,But if he wasn't completely out of position in the first place he wouldn't have had to make that sort of challenge.
dx7q4bq,miguel_is_a_pokemon,"Player also came in on Chiellini's side, I don't completely blame Benatia, it was a group effort."
dx7eztt,EdgeFC,"By what, honestly? Wasn't it a pen? I'm pretty sure it was..."
dx7i07u,yslithal,Flair up
dx7eo89,ArmoredKappa,I'm not...
dx7eof6,FreedomByFire,"Disgusted why? That was penalty. If anything it should have been a double red because Mehdi Benatia was already on a yellow, and Buffon a 20 year vet lost his cool at exactly the right time. Maybe Buffon did it on purpose? He didn't want to be the one to lose the game for his team."
dx7f201,Vmax6,How would he lose his team the game? That makes no sense.
dx7h7yr,FreedomByFire,I mean maybe he didn't want to be the one to not save the penalty.
dx7ije7,Cjdred,"If a keeper doesn't stop a pen, that doesn't mean they're the reason why they lost the game at all. Even if Buffon didn't get dismissed, there is no way he could've stopped Ronaldo's shot."
dx7eydt,floridali,sad. just sad.
dx7e8wv,Scouter08,Fuck this shitwhat a terrible way to end such a great game
dx7ezdv,Rmonte90,Yeah. Shame we have to play within the rules
dx7fcm8,assassinadam41,Seriously like how did Oliver not make the right call? I get everyone hates Madrid but that was a clear pen
dx7g42b,crinkle_cut_pickles,"I don't think he/she's complaining about following the rules, and I understand why people think it's ""terrible."" It would have been an incredible comeback with so many amazing storylines....instead, Madrid advance in a tournament they've won the past two years."
dx7yig0,looz4q,"Well, if Real had a good reputation people would cheer for them and they would be content after such a win, but they're not everyone's favourite team, so most of the people just trashtalk them and the referee."
dx7fjyv,JokeSportGuy,Real Madrid only does things within the rules. Yep.
dx7g2x3,DareiosX,"Ah so because Real gets away with breaking rules sometimes, everyone they play against should be exempt from the rules?"
dx7fn4v,nocturn-e,A rightful penalty and a deserved red. How is that terrible?
dx7gkzq,I_travel_for_work,"Because you won. And you always win. It's not your fault, and it was a penalty. But it sucks, because we just don't like it. Not saying it's wrong. We just don't like it."
dx7hl3m,chinookk,It was a super dramatic ending and we got to see Ronaldo being Ronaldo in the 97th minute of a super intense game. Also a gem of a penalty. I can't really think of a more dramatic way to end the game. As a neutral this game was a thrill from mandzukic's goal to the very last second.
dx7fhty,pujanquake23,*what a great way to end the game.
dx7eaeq,GameplayerStu,He was never missing that in a million years
dx7s6g2,justsean09,"I'm just so sick of seeing Real win everything now, it's like we're witnessing the start of a never ending cycle."
dx7far4,sageadam,"Instead of blaming the ref, blame the defender for such a stupid move."
dx7f3s1,Feeceez,"You have to have some huge balls to call a pen in the last minute in a game like this. Props to the ref for not falling to the pressure and delivering. Correct call, it's a pen."
dx7ho4m,wizkatinga,For some reason I don't see the pen
dx7j08x,BasilandLavender,Some people are just slow through no fault of their own
dx7jx9o,prawntheman,"Yes, you take allll the time you need."
dx7hnkx,AnesZizak,Takes even bigger balls not to call it given the situation. Agree fully that it's a pen
dx7ef6k,theduckofreasoning,How was it not a pen?? He came from the back and didn't get the ball are you all insane
dx7f72s,TauriKree,Just pure unfiltered salt.
dx8ti4n,vox_veritas,It's a mountain of that expensive Himalayan salt... the pink shit.
dx7eyxe,Muslim_Pulisic,"""But the ref couldn't have possibly seen it!!!"""
dx7fwn1,NoSoyTuPotato,The Real crest negates any extra time pks. look it up in the rule book. totally unfair for Juve
dx7en9m,elis8,Every. Damn. Time.
dx7fke9,real_shadowave,"Yes Juventus came back from a 3 goal deficit in the Bernabeu. Yes a legend named Buffon deserves a win. Yes it's in added time. But none of these are reasons for it to not be a penalty for Madrid, plain and simple. Madrid exposed Juventus's defense in the final seconds and caused Benatia to commit a mistake, that's all."
dx7kacl,muyuu,"I don't think it was, no morality or prejudice involved."
dx7hw5a,kalusche,"Naa, it was a 50/50 decision. In that situation, the referee should not have decided the game in that way."
dx7inwq,Flux_7,"Translation: I don't like RM and they shouldn't have won by a penalty.Deluded, great call."
dx7ejsy,Rompler,Last time I checked you can't kick people in the ribs. Clear penalty.
dx7fylk,Wyned,Ikr? I'm still waiting for de Jong's red card for the flying kick on Xabi Alonso back in 2010.
dx7g3sk,KingAn2903,That ref was awful man
dx7fof7,0aniket0,And from behind as well
dx7fh86,ShadowDandy,Even if you are falling before being touched?
dx7ghgc,thefurnaceboy,"look so obviously im biased, but is the narrative here that lucas went down when he was one on one with all the advantage in the world looking for a pen rather than score the easiest goal of his life and become the hero?"
dx7h9o0,JokeSportGuy,"Uh, yes. Like 75% of players it was obvious he was going for the pen"
dx7qhv1,sebas8181,Yes? Not that this was the case anyways since Benatia pushed him before the kick.
dx7fvcp,Thebambino25,Mate watch something other than top tier football. Happens every 5 minutes. These guys are pussies if that's a pen
dx7ecfl,rsyay,"Was a penalty, idk how anyone could argue that. Poor Buffon though haha. Real Madrid shouldn't be cheering embarrassing performance."
dx7f9fg,kokek,They played ok..not great but ok. They had chances to score but buffon did his job amazing.
dx7fjss,CrazayTaylor92,Lol as if Madrid would just walk off the pitch with their heads held low. They just won one of the most entertaining champions league draws in recent memory. Of course they're going to cheer.
dx7g9pm,nocturn-e,Yeah fuck us for being happy we won a close match
dx7eshn,UneasyInsider,Buffon brought it on himself tbh. It's sad it had to end that way though.
dx7faki,Pretty_Sharp,I think this will get missed. I don't think Madrid have much to celebrate if they carry this performance forward.
dx7i7i2,Swatieson,We need to be the underdogs against you otherwise we stand no chance.
dx7fo5b,mxchickmagnet86,IMHO the Madrid player's legs start to cave before Benatia even reaches him. He's looking to go down with that contact the whole way. If he wanted to stay up he would have put his feet farther out and leaned back to brace himself.If he was trying to stoop and head it ( which I doin't think he was ) he would have kept his eyes on the ball and made contact regardless of Benatia because his momentum would have kept him moving towards the ball to generate power.Obviously all really tough to see in real time for Oliver.
dx7feof,Skas67,I argue that. Soft contact and it happens after asencio misses the ball.
dx7j1dg,Marco-the-Pineapple,"I would argue that it was incredibly dramatized and not a fowl. If he didn't fall, which he did so tactically, he wouldn't have been rewarded a penalty. Desperate move, but it's a part of the game. The ref is the judge and he called it so it doesn't matter what anyone thinks. Personally, I wouldn't have called it. Edit: smash that disagree button h8rs 🤘🏼"
dx7gn8r,I_travel_for_work,Yeah the taking off of the shirt felt pretty silly.
dx7ex1m,flocopter,If I was Gigi I would have punched the ref after the red and ended my career
dx7g7xw,Prem_Naam_Hai_Mera,He ended his career already before the red.
dx7g3oc,dimaka65,"I would have punched him and then batter Penaldo, destroy his face, improve the chances of both juve and the other teams. Atleast we can now hope for Lovren to murder him."
dx7jsjv,real_shadowave,the fuck
dx7kdkg,dimaka65,"I was not literal with this, but I want to see him cry like a bitch and Degsy seems the most capable of injuring him without getting booked."
dx7e7r5,,[deleted]
dx7ed7v,TheyDidItFirst,Would have changed nothing
dx7egyy,thisistheslowlane,Exactly. VAR is for glaring 100% errors only.
dx7eq4k,jka005,"While I think the call could go either way, you are definitely right that no var would ever overturn that."
dx7edp5,Time_Waits_For_Me,Why?
dx7eg3f,Krist794,because the penalty was legit
dx7ejvp,Time_Waits_For_Me,"Thats my opinion ,too.Harsh because it was last minute pen,but right call .Benatia made a clumsy push Vazquez from behind"
dx7em74,stafffy,There is a difference between contact and a push
dx7ee9q,lclear84,I mean I don't really see how it isn't a penalty lol. He pushes and kicks him
dx7emea,AndyFNG,"its madrid getting the penalty and buffon getting fucked, this is r/soccer nightmare"
dx7fu6e,sebas8181,"You missed the 1.5x multiplier, Ronaldo scoring. And the 4x multiplier, Ronaldo scoring a penalty."
dx7eoyx,WuuutWuuut,"Thats the problem at the moment. There's hardly consitency on what constitutes a penalty, red or yellow. Just look at this subreddit. Almost weekly there's call from a ref that is debated endlessly. Why? Because there's No clear standard and if there is, it's not being followed."
dx7euni,bydy2,Brushes the ball before kicking the player
dx7fgmm,firechaox,But before that he clearly pushed him down with both hands on his back. He had no intention of playing the ball. So it's still a penalty.
dx7fvt7,sebas8181,He doesn't even touch the ball in the whole play.
dx7ewi5,Latinola1,Yup right away put both hands on his back to push and then adds the kick on the side to top it off. The kick could be argued a on ball but the hands on the back for the push came first.
dx7elp1,madca_t,"He pushes him ever so lightly and he didn't kick him, he didn't kick the ball either, his leg didn't touch his torso from what I can see."
dx7fiwy,firechaox,"Watch it again, pushes him down with both hands on Vasquez back, and afterwards he does touch the torso (although he touches the ball slightly with the kick)"
dx7fotl,madca_t,"If he had pushed him with any kind of strength Vásquez wouldn't jump and fall below rather lump forward and that didn't happen. I watched it again and he just doesn't touch his torso at all, there's no contact with his shirt either, maybe I need a different replay."
dx7efmo,ganellon_,"would not have changed anything, both for the penalty and the card."
dx7ehld,goto_man,It's a penalty. VAR wouldn't make a difference.
dx7egc1,Andtheyrustledsoftly,So they could confirm it was a pen? He clattered him from behind and kicked him in the chest
dx7fs7m,crownpr1nce,"I agree it was a pen, but I would have still liked to have VAR on it. If anything just so that more refs say this was a pen. People might still disagree, but I think it would be to a lesser extent if it was confirmed by another ref."
dx7efun,raziiiii,Still would've been called. I don't understand how anyone can say it wasn't. Now the straight red ro buffon was absolutely bullshit
dx7fdof,ThePeleOfMissionary,Not if Buffon makes contact with Oliver. Which he does.
dx7fexg,raziiiii,"Yeah saw that on the replay. Correct call. Feels bad though, Buffon is class"
dx7g5el,ThePeleOfMissionary,Wholeheartedly agree. Heartbreaking way to end his European career.
dx7efpp,Kaiathebluenose,VAR what?
dx7e92j,PKM999,Absolutely unreal.
dx7f4jc,Commandophile,Real

dx7e983,Cairne_Bloodhoof,Holy fucking shit
dx7gung,Supapenguinman,"Juve was looking pretty ragged near the end, doubt they would've lasted through OT tbh. I still feel shitty for Gigi though..."
dx7nnzi,Draxy_,Not sure if it was going in before brushing Kane's shoulder...
dx7pc21,xNinjaah,"Szczesny has balls of steel. The man looked so confident, walking up to the goal, spitting on his gloves, in one of the biggest stages in the world. From Arsenal to Juventus.Imagine. Imagine if he saved it.The penalty though. Unbelievable. I don't think any keeper would be able to save that. The confidence on those players. Wow."
dx7pehw,ggggal,Ppl saying there was zero/little pressure on Lucas.. its not like benatia was standing still next to him and slightly pushed him lol he was coming in with speed and its hard to not fall if someone does that to u
dx7rn98,justsean09,"I was really hoping Juve would get one up on Real this year. Bayern are probably our best chance of defeating the giant that is Real Madrid, but I'm hoping for Liverpool to conquer once more as I'm English.It would be really exciting if Roma came out on top of course."
dx7vlsb,aadharsh_2,"I understand the pk and the red but holy shit poor fucking Buffon. I would have absolutely, utterly, completely fucking snapped in his position after the red (and I'm not even a huge juve fan)"
dx7xo5e,STOP_SCREAMING_AT_ME,This is a very different Ronaldo from the one who missed that soft penalty in the 2008 CL final. This Ronaldo has balls of adamantium.
dx8a4xg,CoolstorySteve,Glad the comments of correct pen given are finally higher than those whining saying Juve were robbed.
dx7ea5m,Relefencion,Such a shame for Juve
dx7fpej,AlexiLaIas,I'm just here to collect Barcelona tears.
dx7ea0s,Schveen15,"Correct call, no doubt"
dx7ewdt,ForestEye,"I don't really know how people in this thread are claiming that wasn't a penalty.Benatia ran through the back of him, had two hands on his back, got over top of him and kicked him when trying to win the ball.If there's a man between you and the ball just because it's the 93rd minute doesn't mean running him over isn't a foul. And a foul in the penalty area is a penalty.shrug - it was a great game but Real created a probable tap in that Benatia stopped by fouling. Shit way to have a game end but it was all legit."
dx7gc1w,aqua_maris,Referee's only mistake here was not booking Benatia for denying obvious goalscoring opportunity :)
dx7egr7,rasherdk,This is where everyone pretend it wasn't a clear pen or a red card because they like Buffon.
dx7i67y,nehardElhidine,"I wanted Juve to win, but damn for the sake of Barca fanboys... VAMOS CR7!"
dx7g1g0,Mandalf_the_Guy,When Ronaldo pushes a ref and gets a red everyone laughs and memes it up when it happens to Buffon it's a shit call. I like and respect Buffon as much as the next guy but come on.
dx7ng55,brecht_,"It's crazy. The guy is so good that everybody hates him. I think he's a hard working, worldclass athlete and a fair player. The dude is just a mega pro and an absolute master in his craft. People should respect that."
dx7efrn,ky2rie,What the fuck is everyone crying about? It was clearly a foul and Benatia should be thankful the rules changed or he'd be sent off too.
dx7f4qk,Oelingz,Ref probably didn't care about sending off Benatia once he sent Buffon off...
dx7fe5j,OptsDan,"Fair play. Sometimes the fairytale just isn't meant to be.Unbelievable guile from Juventus. Despite losing the tie, their performance and achievement is unbelievable. A poor game by all accounts for Ronaldo, but still on one of his worst nights he delivers excellence. A powerful leap and a dominant penalty.Shame on everyone condemning Oliver. The minute of the game, the score line or the location on the pitch should not effect the decision. If this was anywhere on the pitch, it's the clearest FK he gives all game.I love Gigi, but intimidating the ref is reprehensible and it's about time they stamped down on it.All in all, what a game. Not the result we all hoped for but a thrilling 90 minutes nonetheless.Think Zidane got it wrong, using his subs early. If this game went to ET, I couldn't see anyone but Juve winning."
dx7qonu,sebas8181,"Not sure what Ronaldo did you watch. He was the only good player for RM, the only one really trying on the attack. Without Benzema he was pretty much alone up there, and he was the one to deliver the penalty ball to Vazquez. He also scored a penalty many players would fail at that pressure. It wasn't his best match but it wasn't even like Messi yesterday where he didn't even try."
dx8dq6i,bashfulray,"What? Apart from the penalty he literally did nothing. If by trying on the attack you mean trying to win a penalty, yeah. That attempt where he cut in and tried to kick it through an entire defence rather than play his teammate in. I mean damn, you guys hold him to such a low standard."
dx8z8bc,sebas8181,"Are you serious? Did you watch the game? He was the only one in the attack trying bc Isco and Bale were invisible. The play you are mentioning was basically him vs 5 defenders and no one near or in good position for a pass. It was a genius thing that he evne managed to shoot on target between 2 defenders. Gosh, the hate is real."
dx8cq6v,Skalby,Lol Ronaldo was amazing all game. Cant take the rest of your comment seriously when you cant even see that
dx8ghoq,OptsDan,"Didn't really test the keeper, felt quite isolated due to Real's set up. Went down easily on a couple of instances when he might have done better on his feet.Nonetheless, an unbelievable leap and amazing penalty."
dx8imqi,Skalby,Yes he was isolated and still managed to be a threat. Imagibe thinking that ronaldo played badly

dx7kd4q,what_the_frank,"I think it would but you never know.Well played, you played really well and used our weaknesses. Such an unfortunate ending."

dx7k5kg,what_the_frank,They woke up them selves with that last minute tackle.
dx7ecti,Theart_of_the_cards,"Thats a pen, and if everyone calms down youd realise buffon got the card for pushing him around and also probably saying some mean shit. You cant cant lose your head like that against a ref."
dx7eurk,Elgin_McQueen,"Totally, all the people saying it shouldn't be a red, they have no idea what words came out of his mouth to help the ref make that decision."

dx8an3s,MobiWanKenobi,"People might, they already are, hating us but the penalty was clear as day. Sad it had to end that way, especially for Buffon but that's what KO stages are all about, one mistake and you are out. I can't understand why they didn't go all out in defense in the last minute of the game."
dx8c41d,Stalked_Like_Corn,"As someone who watched the game but don't watch regularly, how did Juventus lose if they won 3-1?"
dx8cec8,ThaDestiny,"It's the quater final, it's played in two legs. Real Madrid won the first game with 0-3. Now they lost 1-3, over two legs the score is 3-4 in advantage of Real Madrid"
dx8d7f3,Stalked_Like_Corn,"Oh man, that is disappointing. I am from the US but live in Tunisia and they are obsessed with football. I was at a cafe and it was on. Was an exciting match to watch and since I only knew Ronaldo, i was happy to see the underdog win but, I guess they didn't. That's unfortunate. Still a great match."
dx97ug2,blahblahcomewatchTV,"I'm sorry if this is a personal question, but why would an american leave the US and goes to live in this part of the world while people would kill to live in the US instead?"
dx9hs41,Stalked_Like_Corn,Because it was easier to do that then to get my Wife to the US. She is Tunisian.
dx9i1p3,blahblahcomewatchTV,Ahh the power of love. Thank you for answering sir. I hope you have a happy life :)
dx8isoh,TheRedJoker93,"People are letting blind hatred of my team keep them from seeing a very objectively clear reality. Benatia made a really stupid decision that was a clear penalty on Vazquez after getting away with quite a few tackles that could easily have seen yellows. Otherwise he played very very well. Madrid did not deserve to lose the tie over two matches just because of the most recent match being exciting. That is why it is two legged in the first place. Give credit where it is due. In this match, Juve played out of their minds and deserve credit. But football is fucking cruel sometimes despite the beauty. Be honest with yourselves also. At no point did Madrid's attack or control of the ball collapse like Barca did at Roma. Every goal got a response from the Bernabeu and the blancos. Even Gigi accepted that part. Please stop letting blind hatred take you away from the truth. Even I felt bad for Juve, but the score is the score and that was a clear penalty that Gigi would not have saved anyway. Let's add that Mehdi Benatia was still on the field afterwards! Juve could have ended the match with 9 men. For the record, I've never been keen to remember a match that we lost 3-1 at the Bernabeu. This one deserves it. Juve should be proud but it was not enough. I still love you Gigi. That is all."
dx8j7mw,KingNothing666,"He hit it fucking perfectly. Unsaveable penalty kick, holy shit"
dx7ek61,Glorx,Ronaldo wasn't going to miss that one.

dx7gopl,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,100%. People saying otherwise are blind
dx7eko8,SpacemanD13,100% a penalty. Sorry it doesn't fit everyone's fairytale story.
dx7fb2q,AngryWelshSheep,People talking like Buffon and Juve was owed a second chance. Like to see if they have that opinion if this happens against their club.

dx7nxsf,karlverkade,"But this time the contact, though minimal, does put him off a clear shot on goal while also not getting the ball. I think even anywhere else in the box the ref doesn't call this. But if Benatia doesn't touch him, he scores. I hate how easily he went down, but I think the ref has to call it here."

dx7fdrm,sneakschimera,"I think it was for putting hands on the referee anyways, as Oliver started getting his card out before he even turned to face Buffon"

dx7kelk,AntiChr1st,"The ref is a useless piece of shit an it was not a penalty.The defender barely touch him with the foot, there is no push and the RM player dives instead of making an actual play. In hockey you get punished for diving, and they will punish you for it not just when it is blindingly obvious but also if you're not trying to stay on your feet. Copy the diving rules from hockey and the RM player doesn't fall there. Because he doesn't get touched enough to fall, he gets touched enough that he thinks he can get a penalty if he falls.This is one of the big problems with football today, players are playing the ref not the game."
dx7l0v1,Marco2169,"Lmao you are comparing the physicality of hockey to football. That's a foul anywhere else on the field, you can't push someone (yes, he was pushed, look at the other angles) from behind and wrap your leg around him. The ref being labeled a ""useless piece of shit"" when he makes a correct decision contrary to your emotions is part of the problem."
dx7m7s4,AntiChr1st,"> Lmao you are comparing the physicality of hockey to football. No I am talking about how they handle *diving*, as in players falling when they wouldn't normaly because they are trying to play the ref rather than the game. I am not comparing the physicality of the sports. I am comparing how the sports handle players diving. The rules in hockey prevent diving, the rules in fotball encourage it. That's the point.> yes, he was pushed, look at the other anglesNo he wasn't, there is light contact and he sees his chance to dive. If football actually punished players for diving he doesn't fall there. > The ref being labeled a ""useless piece of shit"" when he makes a correct decision contrary to your emotions is part of the problem.The ref decided a champions league game with a terrible call, then made it worse by sending giving out a red card because his feefees got hurt when a player complained about his blatantly idiotic call. He is part of the disease that has plagued this sport for decades and it will never improve until people like him are gone."
dx7ouar,Marco2169,"It seems like most people disagree with your opinion on Oliver's call, but I respect your opinion. It was a tough call to make. (dont think hes part of disease though). Also the rules literally don't allow for diving, its just tough to call in action (something I acknowledged as a problem). But you should stop putting Hockey on a pedestal, considering the reputations some top players like Crosby and Subban have built around their embellishment."
dx7pzc7,AntiChr1st,"> its just tough to call in action It is, and it's not made easier by football insisting on only the one ref and the resistance against video reviews (which I've never understood, it's odd that people are so worried the ref might not fuck up). But the current rules around it also mean the players are encouraged to do it because it's such a low risk thing to do. It doesn't matter if it's against the rules when de facto it is a tool the players use and they use it because it works. The dive has to be really obvious to get punished. There are essentially 3 things that need to happen for diving to go away.1-They are currently not told to try to stay on their feet, this has 2 parts.a-you see players all the time who fall down screaming and laying there like they've broken a leg, and within 2 minutes they're running around like normal. Make it a mandatory health check when you do that, 15 minutes off the field to be looked at by a doctor while your team plays with ten or switch you out. That will be gone immediately.b-Embellishment should be added, because it requires players to try to keep on their feet and keep playing no matter what since you can get punished for going down too easily *Even if you were legitimately fouled*.2-add 2 assisting refs.3-The last is video reviews, including post game. If after a match it becomes obvious someone dove the punishment should come down and it should come down *hard*. I've suggested 5 game bans for it before with all games affected changed into a loss (though yes I realize I am being harsh there and something lower might be more reasonable)."
dx7egi3,yvanovits,"It's a penal, but its so sad for Buffon..."
dx7ewi9,StandardDefinition,Don't be its completely his fault that he got sent off
dx7f6qk,yvanovits,"When your watching soccer without emotion, yes ofcourse. That's were soccer is laking in my opinion. Almost everybody will say some bad words in the heat of the moment, definitly in the 93th minute with a deciding penalty call, can't blame him for that. Let him says his things, get on with the penal and give the man a chance to be a hero.."
dx7fe82,StandardDefinition,"True, I think the main reason people are upset about the sending off is because it's Buffon. If it was a more controversial player (i.e. Dele) then everyone would be applauding the decision."
dx7hm4k,TheMentallord,"It's ok to contest the referee's decision, but he was chest bumping and screaming at him the whole time. You're not supposed to try to intimidate the referee and that's exactly what Buffon was doing. 100% deserved IMO."

dx7fidv,yvanovits,"The ref made the right call, but like I said in my other comment. Soccer is more then just a textbook of rules which you have to obey. You can't tell me that you wouldn't shout at the ref in the heat of the moment at a moment like that. That's were soccer is laking in my opinion, let the man shout, everyone does, get on with the penalty and give the man a shot at being a hero..."
dx7g0cp,come_on_mr_lahey,"Yeah I do agree, but the ref has rules to follow and you can't blame him for that"
dx7h0fk,yvanovits,"Ow I do not blame him for that at all, It's just something I find laking in soccer globale. Pep yesterday was sort of the same story. These rules are, in my opinion, not out thinked enough (Sorry if thats bad English, not my native language).Like, when some shouts at a rev in cold blod out of the blue, sure thats a red. When some one shouts a the rev in the heat of the moment at a crucial point in the game? No matter the player, you should take that with a grain of salt. But watching the rules, thats a red too. Rules only work in a environment with consistent variables, only soccer does not have those consistent variables. Emotion for one, is one that does not get enough attention in my opinion.Sorry for the ramble, just putting my thoughts out.."
dx7fslk,nocturn-e,Why? He got himself sent off.
dx7eoou,drjpkc,"lol reddit full of bellends, that was a penalty 100% don't know what everyone is banging on about."
dx7ehx5,MCbadboy,"People cheering for an upset and getting mad it didn't happen. Benatia pushed Vazquez and prevented him from scoring, clear penalty"
dx7eps7,Tyafastics,"What is with this fucking subreddit, just because this doesn't fit the narrative of a Gigi comeback it's not a penalty! Of course it's a pen, he puts both hands in Vazquez' back and barges him over with no contact on the ball. 100% a pen!"
dx7elkg,dqhigh,"It is, if it was any other team it's a pen."
dx7enbl,AgmaWang,"Yeah man really what the fuck is wrong with people? Yes it's really sad but it's %100 pen, look at his legs"
dx7eeoh,Banskyi,"It is, just shitty to have it called in extra time Edit- should have said happen*"
dx7ek13,fortean,"That's when it happened, though."
dx7f2kq,shy247er,And in a very clear goal scoring opportunity.
dx7ffth,sneakschimera,I'm surprised it wasn't a 2nd yellow for Benny too...
dx7f8qp,Banskyi,I'm not disagreeing but as neutral I would've liked to see a better ending. That's why I said it was shitty it happened so close to the end of regulation
dx7fqgb,VodkaHappens,"Mate don't get fouled after the 90 minute mark, his instructions are pretty clear. I get what people are angry about though, very anti-climatic. I could do with some extra time."
dx7f7cl,thedeliberative,"Wait, what? It wasn't in extra timeedit: don't get the downvotes. The penalty was given in added time, not extra time."
dx7ekxb,kazcmot,foul is a foul
dx7enhl,jasie3k,So there is a different set of rules for extra time?
dx7egm3,JoshuaFC,Idk it seems to me like vasquez was going for a diving header and as soon as he felt a bit of contact he let himself flop . .
dx7gbze,robotnique,"Those are some Barcelona tinted goggles, my friend. I wanted Real to lose as much as the next man, but if you can't wrap your arms around a player you certainly can't wrap your legs around him to hold him in place."
dx7ggxh,JoshuaFC,Unless your in mma and on the ground I'm not sure that physically possible. By the way this was a split second action. I'm not sure where the holding happens. Congrats to Madrid tho
dx7hxtu,robotnique,"Hard for Vazquez to make a move on the ball with Benatia's leg, from behind, planted against his torso.Benatia should have never let him get goalside, and should have at least given Buffon a chance and/or legally tried to keep Lucas from getting off a good shot.That being said, men make poor decisions in desperate situations sometimes, and if it were my team I wouldn't hold it against him for too long."
dx82ly5,JoshuaFC,Well pique and Alba did the same with dseko yesterday and I'm already over it. Life goes on
dx7f3xz,Divolinon,> he let himself flop What does this even mean?
dx7fis5,sneezyo,It means doing a Pique
dx7hun2,CarlosFer2201,"He means Vasquez didn't fake it, he exagerated it"
dx7fwk7,RyzinEnagy,"Americans use ""flop"" in place of ""dive."" He's still using it wrong, because ""let yourself dive"" makes zero sense."
dx7f1lc,HangisLife,that's what I saw too. He was leaning over before any contact
dx7fcbt,gonnacrushit,"of course, he was going for a header are you retarded"
dx7fyhf,JoshuaFC,Chill man... Chill
dx7fl15,HangisLife,"not a penalty, just normal contact in the box. We've seen much worse during corner kicks"
dx7fpp8,gonnacrushit,ok man. People surely jump-kick others in the box
dx7go52,le_x_X,He did. Went down easy to secure a penalty.
dx7f3y7,Taxonomyoftaxes,He got kicked in the fucking ribs...
dx7g98m,JoshuaFC,[Idk](https://i.imgur.com/DAy1ic5.jpg)All I'm saying is from this frame it seem like he got the ball. And I don't see contact with any ribs. I'm not an expert tho so don't come all agro on me
dx7gtzd,Taxonomyoftaxes,That's literally a single frozen frame with no context where it isn't even clear he got the ball and we obviously can't see the kick to the chest because you froze it before that occurred. You're absolutely grasping at straws
dx7ha4s,JoshuaFC,I honestly tried to get different frames but I couldn't . Guess it might be my phone. If you could and link any that would be appreciated
dx7hoks,Taxonomyoftaxes,"Watch the second angle, he quite clearly kicks Vasquez in the chest"
dx7hw1w,JoshuaFC,"Lol ok I'll find this second angle you speak of. Even though there's multiples angles, I'll find this specific second angle you speak of"
dx7ijdk,Taxonomyoftaxes,The one shown in the fucking posted video
dx82k0p,JoshuaFC,Lol you need to chill. It's been a couple hours. Hopefully you've chilled
dx7fap9,lore473,"Yeah but the leg hitting him was probably what made it into foul, I think it was a stupid decision by Benatia, Buffon was at his peak tonight and Vasquez is not a great finisher even less with his head."
dx7fsq6,Linquista,"Yeah... no. That was definitely a penalty. Stupid move by Benatia, then again it would've probably been a goal by Vasquez had he not done it."
dx7gco0,JoshuaFC,Well I'm mean obviously to you it is. I'm just saying it's 50/50 and var would've probably settled this. Congrats tho.
dx7f2er,greenslime300,Looks it to me as well. Part of the Real Madrid philosophy though
dx7eye7,PM_Me_Unpierced_Ears,"You're right, and he would have gotten away with flopping if it weren't for the guy straddling him in mid air from behind after pushing him and then kicking him in the chest..."
dx7fhco,rezwah,He got kicked in the chest FROM BEHIND.Can we just think about that? ha
dx7f8hy,10241988,"He literally tried to wrap his leg around him to hit a ball on the other side that quite likely would have resulted in a goal, clearly hit him on the side and I believe right in the chest.I'd maybe understand if you were saying it's not a card (which it wasn't anyway) but I have no idea how that could be interpreted as not a penalty."
dx7gh0x,Unacccounted,"focus only on benatia and it looks like he pushed him from a heading opportunity...Focus only on vasquez, it looks like a dive..."
dx7gyew,JoshuaFC,Guess I need that 360 angle camera shit cuz I can't find any other that the angle where other than the one where benatia comes from behind
dx7ewid,navidghader,He is one meter away from the goal! why dive? It doesn't seem like that to me!
dx7eepx,exiledtie,"There was barely any contact.EDIT: Having watched the replays back a few times, there's definitely enough contact to warrant the penalty, caught up in the emotions of seeing Juve go through."
dx7ej3j,bfc323,"Apart from the body slam from behind, I'd agree"
dx7emjz,exiledtie,"Oh come on, you can't call what Benatia did a bodyslam, there's hands on his back but he barely put any force in and actually went around the player."
dx7eqo8,playingwithfire,Also getting kicked in the ribs...
dx7f010,Kloncs,Yeah. Bloody hell. I'm sure he'll have trouble breathing the next month.
dx7exth,off_by_two,"You can see his head snap back a bit, thats not fake and indicates a clear shove from behind"
dx7ei4l,MVD1600,He would have scored if benatia didn't body slam him
dx7erc3,ScottW51,"I don't think he would have, his body wasn't set for anything?What was he going to do, chest and volley? head? he had no idea what he was doing."
dx7f8av,StatmanIbrahimovic,"Yeah, it was at a very awkward height and Buffon was still on his feet."
dx7f8yk,crownpr1nce,Yeah chest and volley. Plus would he have scored? Who knows doesnt matter at all. Benatia pushed in him the back and kicked him in the chest. Thats a foul anywhere anytime.
dx7f4st,Lorenzo_Insigne,From his position he probably could have just fumbled it in.
dx7enob,_gastly,shhhhh that goes against the narrative
dx7eozv,TheGreatWhoreOfChina,That wasn't a body slam. He applied pressure and went down too easily.
dx7epgt,cannem420,body slam lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
dx7eyda,Charlesdarwinsaunt,"I'm not saying it wasn't a penalty but I'm not sure he would have scored, taking the ball on his chest instead of his head seems like a huge risk."
dx7elfu,Crot4le,Nice hyperbole.
dx7em6p,MVD1600,Still holds true. He would have scored
dx7fto5,Crot4le,So admit your comment was bullshit?
dx7n4wu,MVD1600,It was an intentional hyperbole. Believe it or not you are allowed to do that
dx7et34,bretty88,"Do people not know what a hyperbole is? Why the fuck are you getting downvoted? This sub sometimes I swear. A penalty or not, it's a massive overreaction to describe it as a body slam."
dx7n5zn,MVD1600,It was an intentional hyperbole. Obviously it wasn't a body slam
dx7g0jg,Manlad,I think you need to google what that means..
dx7jfcb,Crot4le,I know exactly what it means. Perhaps you should do the googling.
dx7jgbb,Manlad,If you know what it means then why have you used it incorrectly
dx7pnwl,Crot4le,So you genuinely think that a slight nudge in the back is a body slam? Okay then lol.
dx7ppvz,Manlad,He *slammed* into his *body*
dx7emus,Wildelocke,"No, he got his foot around the ball. It was way to awkward to finish."
dx7epot,yes_this_is_2pac,he would have scored if he didnt dive
dx7em0p,gamelink99,There was more contact than that Kane goal and that got awarded.
dx7enqc,exiledtie,And I didn't think that was a penalty either.
dx7en3d,DerFlammenwerfer22,"I saw two hand in the back, leg wrapped around before the ball got there"
dx7eukg,Bona_Fried,Eyesight much?
dx7eyjq,TheIIArencibia,no contact lens in your eyes bitch
dx7eqcx,TactXO,"Agreed, he was already diving for the header"
dx7er67,tTensai,Are you serious?! That was clear as day
dx7f666,sebas8181,No contact like in [NO PUSHING](https://imgur.com/3bdcXNw) or [NO KICKING IN THE CHEST](https://imgur.com/Ns6stec)?
dx7fbdk,exiledtie,">Having watched the replays back a few times, there's definitely enough contact to warrant the penalty, caught up in the emotions of seeing Juve go through."
dx7emsa,adamt_22,He pushed him in the back and brought his leg up to his chest without really trying to play the ball. I'm a Reds fan just like you but I really do think that's definitely a pen.
dx7ew9t,exiledtie,"Yeah, looking at the replays, there's enough to call it a pen."
dx7encx,,[removed]
dx7epqp,exiledtie,"Thoughtful analysis, thanks."
dx7evko,ImRyan12,https://streamable.com/j75t00 contact on the ball.
dx7epud,backtolurk,He hit his arm and gave a little push but I agree it was not exactly brutal. Sucks.
dx7ei0l,AnimalMotif,Looks like he's falling before the contact no?
dx7emao,EliahBernick,He is going in for the header
dx7eoak,FigoStep,Kind of irrelevant even if that's true. He was fouled regardless.
dx7ef1h,Ptile,Crucial moment in the game and you are going to call a foul for that soft shit?
dx7ejvc,saint-simon97,>softstill a penalty however you try to look at it.
dx7eva6,,[deleted]
dx7f0w7,Greflingorax,He barged into his back and wrapped his leg around him. You might get called for that in ice hockey. No way you'll ever get away with that in football.
dx7fqi9,EAF_Gummy_Bear,"All the angles I saw showed him putting his hands on his shoulders and not barging into his back, with him falling down once he felt hands on him. His leg wrapped around was definitely not 100% clean but not worthy of a penalty either to me.Also that would be a clean tackle even if he were to tackle him all the way down to the ground in football."
dx7gl2w,Greflingorax,"We maaaaaay be talking about different ""football""s if you think he could take him all the way down to the ground like that and have it be legal."
dx7gqhf,,[deleted]
dx7gy7c,Greflingorax,"No worries, haha. It just went over my head. Like most things do. Although in my defense, there are so many different nationalities on this sub that it's often hard to tell with things like this."
dx7elcs,dohhhnut,"a foul is a foul, it would have been called outside the box 10/10 times, unfortunate, but just"
dx7enld,sebas8181,Soft shit: * Foul in a 1v1 agiasnt the GK in front of the goal line. * Pushing from behind. * Kick on the chest.
dx7ez0q,bvb19mA,could have been killed.
dx7g5rt,sebas8181,But the dead one is /r/soccer ????
dx7em47,merkaloid,Soft shit? It's not like he could've headed the ball given the height of Benatias foot
dx7enb7,Yurilovescats,A foul is a foul.
dx7enr3,PM_ME_BAKAYOKO_PICS,"It doesn't matter when or where it is, a penalty is still a penalty.It was soft, but he got fouled from behind when he was right in the face of the keeper, that's a pen every time even though I wanted this game to go to ET."
dx7eoco,Mekfal,"Foul in a box it's a pen. Come the fuck on, Juventus played out of their minds but this is always a pen"
dx7fhzg,JeannotVD,Pool fans whining about refrees even when they aren't playing
dx7fuf9,Mekfal,"Fucking Pool fans whining. Imagine, after they shafted Man city with all the shit calls."
dx7gm3b,JeannotVD,"Amen mate, with some luck you get them in the semis and piss r/soccer even more"
dx7embp,Benfranklinstein,Don't think the time should affect the call at all
dx7eq29,flyingkiwi9,"When the foul occurred is irrelevant. I know that line of thinking is big in American sports like Basketball, ""you can't call that in the fourth quarter!"" But in football, a foul is a foul."
dx7etdu,ChiriacAttack,So you don't reject the fact that it was indeed a foul and are still complaining?
dx7etxh,Bittergarnituur,That's not how rules work mate.
dx7evm9,bromosapien234,"""Yeah, I was going to call a pen there, but ya know, given the circumstances, forget it! Extra time will be pretty dope, after all."""
dx7eyyq,Divolinon,It's true in Engeland you may break someone's leg and not get a card but that's not true in the rest of europe.
dx7f4bp,real_shadowave,"It's a scoring chance right in front of the net and Benatia runs right through his back. It doesn't matter if Juventus or Buffon won't get their fairy tale comeback, it's a penalty any time of the day"
dx7fvsm,nocturn-e,A soft foul in the box is still a penalty
dx7envm,Tim-Sanchez,"Time of the game doesn't matter, area of the pitch doesn't matter, score doesn't matter. If it is a foul in minute 1, and a foul at the halfway line, it's a foul in the penalty box at the 93rd minute at 3-3."
dx7eoqv,RepThePlantDawg420,"Yeah, because if Vasquez wasn't bundled over he puts it in the back of the net most likely"
dx7epfw,duckwantbread,Fouls don't become less of a foul because it's a 'crucial moment' unless you're Mark Clattenburg. Pushing someone in the back with both hands and then kicking them isn't exactly a soft penalty anyway.
dx7eq2j,JonstheSquire,So the rules should not apply in the most important situations? That is a solid argument you have.
dx7esjm,Broatchy,He pushed him from behind and kicked him in the chest as the ball was coming to his foot. He would've scored if he wasn't blatantly fouled. Just cause you jump as you're doing it doesn't make it legal
dx7evb0,AnnieIWillKnow,"Well yeah, it was a goalscoring opportunity as clear as day, and Benatia fouled him to take it away. It's a clear pen."
dx7eww0,Irctoaun,"""That soft shit"" meaning the very obvious push in the back? Yeeeaaah that's a foul"
dx7exsy,TheIIArencibia,it wasnt soft shit
dx7eyq6,beavz,soft? a foul is a foul.
dx7f1gn,perkel666,You mean kick in the ribs from behind player in like 2 meters before net ?
dx7f2rp,Lorenzo_Insigne,So you want Juve to undeservedly go through because the ref didn't have the balls to give a pen?
dx7ewu0,DrHoss,100% agree with you. Ignore the downvotes. The guy could have probably scored if he actually tried to take a shot instead of dive at the first hint of contact. Yeah there's contact but if you're gonna call a foul everytime there's contact then we'd have penalties all day. Look at kompanys goal over the weekend. He how much contact is there between him and smalling! Neither of those are fouls but this is? Calls like this are why diving will never be removed from this sport
dx7eed0,PhzyLicka,What would you said he did that deserved a penalty? I saw no foul.
dx7ehiz,MonsieurAuguste,Pushed from the back and kicked him in the chest
dx7fadp,sebas8181,Just to save the people their downvotes without even watching it as usual around here. [Push](https://imgur.com/3bdcXNw) and [Kick in the chest](https://imgur.com/Ns6stec)?
dx7emju,IAmMrMacgee,He wasn't pushed. He was diving for a header so it looks like Benatia pushed him. Rewatch if you think I'm kidding
dx7fpjj,niner-nation,you're an idiot if you don't think he was pushed.
dx7fw20,IAmMrMacgee,You're an immature twat
dx7emqq,PhzyLicka,You mean bruised his back and stretched his leg out in front of him?
dx7f5m1,Nicsefar,KICKED in the chest? ya havin a fekkin laf arnt ya
dx7ewg5,carismo,and roundhouse kicked him in the head.
dx7eib8,Andtheyrustledsoftly,This has to be a joke? He absolutely clattered him full sprint from behind while kicking him in the chest
dx7ehlm,Yahgar,He very clearly used both his hands to push him in the back. Clear penalty.
dx7ejdk,JakeFakeBreak,Have you ever seen a corner kick?
dx7eps5,Yahgar,"Yes, there should be penalties called for those as well, it doesn't change the fact that by the letter of the law, the defender fouled him in the box and it is a penalty."
dx7exw8,Tmsan,"Refs let a lot of shit go during set pieces that they don't under normal play, not really something valid to compare it to."
dx7ek55,TactXO,That's VERY debatable
dx7eo2w,Yahgar,"Is it though? Both of his hands are on his back, not to mention his foot never even gets to the ball so he has just kicked him as well."
dx7f280,TactXO,"From what I saw, the only reason why the RM player fell is because he was diving for the ball"
dx7f3yd,Yahgar,I would advise you watch it again and again until you see what everyone else can clearly see.
dx7fkm0,TactXO,OR I can keep my opinion and you can keep yours
dx7gurm,Yahgar,Opinion ≠ Fact
dx7f0j4,Mrg220t,https://i.imgur.com/T8G8UJQ.png
dx7entr,PhzyLicka,"What? He didn't even bruise him. No way, dude."
dx7exi1,Yahgar,I can't tell if you're a troll or just that dense.
dx7eijr,rumzii,Then you know fuck all about football.
dx7eqdw,EAF_Gummy_Bear,"There was a mild foul, it was bad enough to be called in the field most of the time. But a penalty at any level is harsh for it, let alone in the last minute of a fucking CL game before extra time."
dx7f15a,PhzyLicka,My point exactly. There is a huge difference between a foul and calling a penalty like that.
dx7eitj,viscagirona,"Pushed him from the back clear on goal, nowhere near the ball, how is it NOT a penalty?"
dx7eith,DocaHyper,"Then you are blind, foot way off the ball and pushed from behind."
dx7ejee,therickymarquez,"2 hands on the back of a player getting ready to receive a ball, foul at all times.It's hard because is such a stupid penalty to make and they came back from 3-0 but it's def a penaty imo"
dx7ekhy,gart888,He ran through a player that had position on him.
dx7ekrj,BIGDirtMan,"I wanted Madrid out as much as anyone else but it's definitely a penalty. No where near the ball, leg across the man. Don't let what you wanted to happen cloud your judgement"
dx7er0r,FigoStep,Absolutely right.
dx7ekyt,Ema919,"This is ridiculous, Benatia got not ball and Vazquez had a clear chance, that was a clear penalty."
dx7emd5,PSMF_Canuck,Other than a hand shove in the back and a foot kick to the chest in an obvious scoring situation...nothing...
dx7elfj,GhostUK11,Pushed him on his back whilst wrapping his leg to attempt to get the ball which he doesnt get
dx7enkw,GhostUK11,If sterling did that though.... yellow card for diving
dx7els6,Bkinzly01,Two hands on his back and had to come through the attacker to wrap his leg around him to try and hit the ball. It's a very tough call but the correct one. That's a foul if it happens in the midfield and that has to be called in the box. It's a super unfortunate way to end the game but unfortunate doesn't mean it isn't right.
dx7elww,doesnt_like_pants,"Genuinely thought he got all ball and no man. Sure, it's not often you see a player wrap his legs around a strikers body and get nothing but ball but I swear he did..."
dx7elzb,mattysimp27,Jumped into his back and kicked him in the chest. I think it's a pen. That happened anywhere else on the pitch and it's a foul.
dx7eoiw,FuujinSama,"He kicked him. He hit the ball but he also hit the player. That's a foul. He wouldn't have gotten to the ball without also hitting the player. I think this subreddit thinks you need to kill the damn player to see a foul, wtf. Illegal contact is illegal contact, doesn't matter if it's ""enough to make someone fall"" or not. He shoved him from the back then hit him with his leg. That's a foul."
dx7ep5f,Winggy,You wont see what you refuse to see... The salt must be clouding your eyes
dx7epo3,Do-I-Need-One,You can't jump into someone's back regardless of strength of contact. Benatia has to know that he was risking that there. IMO it's a soft pen but one nonetheless. One of those if I'm an Juve supporter I'm red in the face but if I'm a Madrid supporter it's 100% a pen.
dx7epq3,Gevaarticus,Benatia leaving his feet and making contact with the player before the ball is always going to be a pen. That was just dumb on his part.
dx7f2v3,chukaluk,Perhaps a trip to the eye doctor is needed friend
dx7favd,Hugh_of_Ilia,looked like Behnatia kicked Vazquez in the chest with his leg wrapping around him
dx7ekyi,ezioauditore_,probably the push in the back and the kick in the chest
dx7el11,Imzarth,both hands on his back and he got pushed
dx7eli8,Tim-Sanchez,"He jumps into the back of him and gets none of the ball. It would be a foul anywhere else.>A direct free kick is awarded if a player commits any of the following offences against an opponent in a manner considered by the referee to be careless, reckless or using excessive force:>* charges* jumps at* kicks or attempts to kick* pushes* strikes or attempts to strike (including head-butt)* tackles or challenges* trips or attempts to tripIf not a push, this is definitely carelessly jumping at a player. You can't just jump through the back of a player and get none of the ball."
dx7elk4,Savage9645,He shoved him in the back from behind...
dx7es6a,Latinola1,Everyone is going to say it wasn't because they are mad they didn't get a remontada happy ending. Still a foul if it was for juve everyone below you would said it was deserved and so on.
dx7f1xm,ginganinja9988,"It is, I was just looking forward to a drama-filled extra time."
dx7fd37,The_Collector4,"Relax he's from Iceland, he's been a fan of the sport for a few years by now."
dx7fncy,ImPradaOfYou,The ref couldn't honestly see it...he had a 50/50 and got it right. But that's not how refs should operate
dx7gprm,hymen_destroyer,"I don't think most people would argue it wasn't a penalty. The end of the game was just a shitshow, a dumpster fire...a lot of crying and time wasting, then Ronaldo scored a penalty against the backup keeper (which is just an awful position for Sczezny to be in at all)...It was like everything I hate about football happened all at once during stoppage time after what otherwise seemed like a pretty good game (I only flipped over from the Bayern game at the 80th minute I admit)As a pretty much neutral fan (although I'm not thrilled about seeing Real advance) it was just an annoying sight. Totally legit penalty though"
dx7ehq3,,[deleted]
dx7f1b6,PM_Me_Unpierced_Ears,"Maybe not a push, but jumping on a dude, kicking him in the chest from behind, after barely pushing him is typically a foul."
dx7erva,a_lumberjack,"You can't just jump into a guy's back anywhere on the pitch, let alone when they're receiving a pass in the six yard box."
dx7f7w7,petersow13,"Agreed man, the one angle from directly behind the goal (that is conveniently not in this clip) showed there was **barely** any contact. Vasquez was waiting on any contact and got it. You don't call that penalty. Not in the last minute of stoppage time in a game of this magnitude."
dx7fj3u,crownpr1nce,WHat about the leg kick in the ribs? Is that not a penalty? Benatia wrapped his whole leg around him going fast at him. He 100% caused him to fall.
dx7hfzp,petersow13,"I'll try to find this other angle I mentioned, it shows how soft it was. It was an angle from directly behind the goal that was shown one time during the foxsportsgo coverage here in America if anyone else has access to it! I was streaming it online so I can't rewind or anything. It shows pretty clearly that Vazquez was waiting on contact, and that the contact was minimal. In that situation, **in my opinion** I don't care if Peter Crouch has jumped on your back and wrapped 16 feet of arms and legs around you, you lung to make contact with ball. You don't collapse like a bag of bricks. Benatia was the only one of the two of them that even tried to go for the ball in the end lol. Not saying there was no contact by any means, just that it was minimal, and that it seems like Vazquez was trying to get a penalty more than he was trying to score. Again, this is in my personal opinion, but to me the referee should have waived it off and let extra time happen unless there was a goal in the next like 35 seconds. May just be me being greedy for epic football, but just my two cents. Cheers!"
dx7ihpa,crownpr1nce,"> I don't care if Peter Crouch has jumped on your back and wrapped 16 feet of arms and legs around you, you lung to make contact with ball. You don't collapse like a bag of bricksThe contact is the foul, not how the player reacts to it. And you're saying Vaquez was 4 feet from goal, in a tied game, and decided to look for contact and a pen instead of trying to score the game winning goal? I dont buy it. It would take a very special kind of stupid to hope for a pen this close from goal.The fact is: Benatia comes in full speed and Vazquez is stationary. He tries to play the ball through him (literally) and makes contact both with his hand from the looks of it (or until someone finds that mysterious angle no one seems to have) and with his leg in his ribs. ITs a penatly no matter how Vazquez reacted or tried to play the ball."
dx7r0bl,petersow13,"I am exactly saying that Vazquez was 4 feet from goal and looking for contact haha. He probably did it because that ball was about to be awkward as **hell** for him to try to score - it kinds looks like he was considering chesting the ball, but that's obviously open to interpretation. Its unfortunately not a special kind of stupid, its the way the game has evolved in this current age. You are exactly right, shoving a player in the back makes the foul, not how the player reacts to it... except Benatia didn't shove Vazquez. Did he touch his back? Absolutely. But football is a contact sport, and in my opinion (and you are certainly entitled to your own opinion as well!) the contact was minimal, and Vazquez exaggerated it to get a penalty. I *love* Messi because he's one of the few prominent players in today's game that **tries to play through contact** like the beast that he is, even at 5'7''. [And he pulls off some *amazing* things doing so](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwF3oxvh3DI), because a lot of times the defenders assume he's gonna go down, and they let up for just a split second, and he's gone. And that's why I don't like the call - I want players to try to play through contact.Don't get me wrong, we've basically stumbled into a conversation about a systemic issue that goes much deeper than this one example - refs need to call fouls that occur even if the player **doesn't fall down**. The way it is now, refs tend to not call fouls if the player doesn't fall and make a scene, thereby giving offensive players an incentive to exaggerate contact. Until refs start calling fouls where players don't fall, while punishing players for exaggerating contact (not just blatant no contact dives) this will be an inherent issue in the sport we all love. Full Disclosure: I'm also biased - I played defense for years, and I was physical, but not dirty. People that dive drove me insane. Some people think there's an *art* to diving and deceiving referees, and I get it. That's just not me. It probably would be if I had played striker, but who knows. [Here](https://streamable.com/tqmh5) is the alternate angle (15 seconds in), but they stop it and don't let it play so its not nearly as clear that Vazquez was barely touched. The replay at speed shows it clearly, but even with the stoppage you can see that Benatia did not kick him. Have a good one!"
dx7i26r,pinkrrr,Can confirm that shot from above the goal shown that Vasquez went down as soon as he felt hands on his back. And i wouldnt call it more than that. Defo didnt kicked him as most people here say.I'm just wondering if that replay will ever make it to /r/soccer.
dx7phwo,petersow13,"haha that was my first thought as well! I found this up top under alternate angles, but of course they stop the view to point things out and don't let it play, so it is harder to see than the full speed angle we saw: https://streamable.com/tqmh5"
dx8wrcj,pinkrrr,[frame by frame](https://streamable.com/gqvw1)
dx94mi0,pinkrrr,"[finally, full speed](https://streamable.com/3cbyk)"
dx7fbtz,,[deleted]
dx7hs1c,petersow13,"haha I think a lot of it stems from me being a defender when I played, so I tend to side with the defensive player in these situations. To me, Benatia did put his hands on Vazquez's back, but not to shove him down, but as anyone would do to help gauge distance and get a touch on the guy. He made a valiant effort to get his foot around get the ball as well. Vazquez was waiting for any contact he felt, got it, and crumpled."
dx7f2um,Rancore__,that would get called 9 out of 10 timessuch a clear penalty
dx7ef63,Andtheyrustledsoftly,"That was 100% a pen, what"
dx7eei3,iKarllos,How is this bullshit? That was probably the stupidest decision making by defender i've ever seen
dx7f57k,TooSwissToWrestle,He'd just finished needlessly clattering through two people in midfield in as well
dx7f946,iKarllos,Funny thing is that he didnt get second yellow here for a foul that caused the pen and Buffon got red for arguing. Really curious what did he say
dx7h57d,shredderrrrrr,"If that's honestly the dumbest decision making you've ever seen from a defender, you need to watch more games."
dx7eki1,JOHN_FUCKING_TITOR,"100% a penalty, unless you're saying bullshit like you didn't want it to end this way, in that case I agree."
dx7eqa3,xxriz3gxx,Yeah
dx7ek7n,BlackSpunk,Its a penalty and a red card. How is it bullshit?
dx7fncv,bigpenisdragonslayer,"It's a super weak pen imo, barely makes contact and then he flops. Yes there's contact but this is one of those situations where I think a red should swallow his whistle"
dx7eg9s,enad1080p,LADS
dx7eqzi,shotgunlewis,benatia knows vasquez is going to score so he pushes him over. it's a foul
dx7eseh,random-guy410,Benatia fault.
dx7f580,Taxonomyoftaxes,"He kicked the lad in the fucking ribs while pushing him down, how is that not a pen?"
dx7efmm,_alexandermartin,It was a weak penalty but it was a foul tbh
dx7egtj,black_fire,what is the dispute that it's not a penalty? Too soft?*genuinely curious
dx7enqv,ProfessorLupinstein,"Questionable penalty, but sending Buffon off was absolutely the wrong call. Ref should have allowed him to be passionate and upset. There's too much at stake to send him off at the last minute."

dx7frsp,niner-nation,UEFA made Benatia commit a stupid challenge ?
dx7eznu,Jeffy29,"White wedding, Ronaldo slit the throat of Old Lady without care. How fucked up the ending was.Best ever QFs? I think so."
dx7ega2,gunsof,"Vazquez is always looking for penalties, it's like 99% of his game plan is an excuse to find someone to push him over or to find a leg to trip himself up over."
dx7e8yq,ocean_deep_yo,Expected
dx7hxa1,FrankCesco,"TLDR of the comments99%: ""clear penalty""1%: i feel sorry for buffon0%: real comments on the match"
dx7l0vp,darsman,You mean on this post showing the penalty shot and call? I think it makes sense
dx7i7ix,zdfld,"What a fucking player. Wins the header to get the penalty, than puts it away perfectly. Really stepped up when Real needed him to, again"
dx7id2b,shoutouttoallmypearz,"He was good the entire match, a lot of the others didn't show up though"
dx7mo3g,brecht_,Fuckin A ! Dudes a stud !
dx7ebtk,Michy_Batshuayi,Honestly as soon as Ronaldo took that breath i felt it would go in. Feel like he just brushed the pressure off with that
dx7fnjw,The-Disco-Phoenix,did you expect him to hold his breath
dx7hatg,JokeSportGuy,As soon as he blinked. I knew.
dx7egsq,HaagenDazs,"Soft penalty still a penalty. Dude was clearly pushed in the back, he doesn't have eyes in his fucking back to just fall at the exact timing."
dx7h6t8,elmieom,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0
dx7irr0,Hezkey,"4k comments and not a single one mentioning how Alex Sandro literally caused the goal. Whole Juve team had an offside line and he was like 3 meters behind making Ronaldo on-side, which also then made Vazquez clean infront of goal. Benatia actually did pretty good to even get there IMO. And also, what an absolutely insane fucking ball from Kroos... Literally perfect."
dx7ph04,cali86,"I don't like Madrid, I wanted them to get knocked out but come on! Benatia is a fucking idiot! He fucked his own team up with the stupidest thing he could do, how does he kick Vasquez chest from behind, WTF"
dx7egqh,ParticlMaximalist,Dear /r/soccer get rekt
dx7f49k,KungFuGreen,Madrid isn't to blame for Benatia stupid ass
dx7fc1j,gonmendonca,"I dislike real as much as anyone can, but that penalty call is spot on IMO.Shame to see Buffon that upset, it breaks my heart"
dx7fcdi,isaacongzy,All of you wanted that fairytale come back but it was a clear penalty. He literally booted him on the chest from behind ffs. Just because it doesn't fit the narrative does not mean it wasn't a penalty.
dx7hh27,Thefifalegend21,Finally someone with some common fucking sense
dx7grig,10mayyy,It was a penalty.. ref actually let Benatia get away with it.. he should have been sent off for a 2nd yellow
dx7eh8m,AhrixMercy69,"i know its heat of the moment and all, but buffon shouldve known better than to yell at the ref like that :("
dx7ei0g,e_muny,Looked like a pen to me tbh
dx7eldn,Josiah1996,I think people who wanted Madrid to lose like myself don't think it's a pen. But watching it again it is and Buffon was rightfully sent off
dx7ewst,thisisjazzymusic,Buffon wouldnt have saved that either...
dx7fn9c,nuho24,lol
dx7fnb4,IdanTs,SWEET BABY JESUS IM DEAD
dx7gezk,russiandollar,surely the defender should also have got a red
dx7gke6,garynevilleisared,That's how you take a fucking penalty. Sad end to a great game though.
dx7ofhh,SunfishWithGlasses,Ronaldo was being abused for a lot of the game when I was watching. Sure some of it was classic Ronaldo play acting but he definitely got fouled a lot
dx7pl88,2Poetic,"Everyone overreacting on that penalty, I'm just like ""Bayern barely made it past Sevilla"""
dx7qvls,HancokUndead,Looks like Ronaldo is trying to score a goal in every possible minute of added time too.
dx7u6rx,NyyTL2020,it was a penalty clearlyidky there is any controversy
dx7uc7e,Rarehero,"I'm afraid that Benatia did enough to earn Real that penalty, pushing Vazquez from behin and hugging with his leg without playing the ball. Vazquez also had no reason to dive. He was in the best position to become the hero of the night, and he couldn't see Benatia coming in from behind. He might have had ""weak legs"", but it was a foul nonetheless, especially from the position of the ref who could only see what looked like a push from Benatia."
dx80y45,Happyzouma22,"Not sure if many may agree but while people are saying he went down before the contact, I don't think vasquez was trying to dive there, it looked to me like he was trying to get his body lower so he could chest, control and volley, and thats when the contact came and sent him to ground., I don't think he would play for a soft penalty considering he was at point blank range there."
dx8dnr4,Lagainsttheworld,It's just the push. It's not like we have video from all angels now.
dx835vm,Arthurs_Boi,"My heart is hoping Buffon decides to come back next season and wins the CL as redemption for the red, but deep down I know this is the end. What a sad way to go out."
dx83dmm,ruthekangaroo,I've been watching since 2010 and I think I've only really seen him get the shit end of the stick in almost every stage.
dx8d48h,Siralosmdk,"Zidane also had a sad way out, but he's still a legend"

dx7e8ml,DizzEthan,Love how he planned to take his shirt off
dx7fcqg,Pdeedb,"really? it was an incredible penalty, and he's an incredible player, but that kind of shit annoys me - it's raw narcissism"
dx7fix9,TheRealLance5123,Saw this coming moment ref called it.
dx7fnwg,gazeebo,I assume the ref not awarding Ronaldo any of the four-ish previous yellows was part of the bribe.
dx7f5ln,indomie_kuah,it makes him calm apparently lol
dx7edd1,wuethar,Well I'll be damned. Oliver made the right call. Great PK by Ronaldo.
dx7fc09,autslash,Insane PK by the man. No Gk would have got to that IMO.
dx7eap3,thelegend_99,"Great pen, no chance of saving."
dx7eg5z,Iheartstreaking,"People saying that was not a penalty, please explain? Looks like the Juve defender jumped on the Real attacker's back before the ball got to him. Is that allowed?"
dx7ejxn,hiro_capone,that penalty clearly came off kane
dx7g5q9,Jmartinr0223,"When will Madrids luck run out? They're a great team, but come on... It's like the universe just clicks everything into position when they're in a bad spot. They could start their U10 team and still win 4-0....I'm done with football, it was a shitty run..."
dx7gs25,MisterVS,They play until the end. Snuck through by playing until the end. It wasn't as if this was an incidental penalty; good setup and goal scoring position and Benatia had limited options.
dx7fl8d,nantesorkestar,Stupid foul and clear penalty.
dx7ecd8,Ro-ftw,Buffon pulled a Zidane retirement!
dx7hecz,the_Bobson,"Meh, no headbutt."
dx7fb1n,Dlurkon427,What a clutch penalty from Ronaldo.

dx7fl3w,arijitlive,"I believe this was a penalty. There will be lot of noise because it was given at injury time, but it was a penalty."
dx7fnew,-SMOrc-,Benatia fucked up hard
dx7fuq8,laserfaces,Worst. Ending. Ever.
dx7hzir,Razegamez1,Penalty but should not have sent off buffon.
dx7jkx1,juancarlosortizramos,That ronaldo would-be assist though... <3
dx7eakf,madcap9,What a fucking penalty!!
dx7efr6,fools_eye,It is a penalty.Don't let the story and the comeback cloud your judgment.
dx7e8xg,Deminero30,Penaldo strikes again.
dx7f2ub,GeekIsBigZ,Lol that was a beautiful penalty though you have to admit that.
dx7f42l,Deminero30,No doubt.
dx7f8dq,Rmonte90,Your right bro. If you were manager you for sure wouldn't have Ronaldo take your pens huh? Probably send varane up there.
dx7gyh4,MeltedBanana,hey man :( leave varane alone
dx7f5ob,xTommy2016x,"You guys are a bunch whiny cunts, that was a clear penalty and Buffon's reaction deserved a red"
dx7gg13,ClassicDaco,"Deserving penalty, sad to see Juve's comeback end like that though.These Quarter finals have been amazing to watch, lets hope the semis are the same"
dx7ej84,Superdanowns,I hate Ronaldo so fucking much.
dx7f36a,RbbT17,"Don't worry mate, me too"
dx7fa6m,Superdanowns,:)
dx7faei,SkyeBot,"The problem is, if the game isn't done yet, they have no business already charging for extras."
dx7fjac,AndrewRealm,"We all do, buddy... we all do."
dx7f942,JMM123,"He needs to show some god damn respect. He got mostly marked out of the game, scores one penalty at the end and runs around taking his shirt off like he's the savior of the world. You just know in his mind he's taking full credit for this win himself. This is why people hate him, so up his own ass."
dx7gop2,BrazilianRider,He LITERALLY scored Madrid's only goal. The game winner. He deserves to celebrate.
dx7gohr,MarkAcquired,"Picture this, JMM123 is playing for Juventus at home. After suffering at the hands of Real Madrid for 90 mins, Juve is awarded a penalty that if scored sends them to the semifinals. With the weight of millions of fans on his/her shoulders, JM123 steps up and converts. Wouldn't he go mental?"
dx7gwxs,Carlthellamakiller,"I know that as a Juve fan you'd have to hate Ronaldo regardless and while your team did play some great defense on him, he was also fouled many times throughout the game which is a fair tactic but probably no so much to Ronaldo. Then in the play of the game he managed to set up what would have been the game winning goal only for Benatia to do what he did. Then after that he had to have the nerve to put away the penalty to win the game and he did. There's no way you can say with all the emotions the fans are feeling that he took off his shirt for pure arrogance, it was all hype imo."
dx7g5w7,zawadz,He threw off his shorts too.
dx7fd9v,Superdanowns,"Yes, this."
dx7fk87,stealthmodemf,You know right that penalty saved rm.Also a certain gentleman had to fake a retirement after he couldn't score a penalty so stop all this bullshit.

dx7ear0,1337ified,Nerves of steel
dx7ekia,StinkyPyjamas,Can't help but feel absolutely no sympathy for Juventus as I remember the diving bastard Nicola Amoruso robbing Celtic of a great result in Turin with a last minute dive for a penalty. Karma.
dx7eueg,etsuited,And they won the final before from a penalty that was a foul outside the box robbing Liverpool.
dx7f50r,Drparrish09,I'm just here for the Barca Bitterness
dx7g7bs,LeChadAussie,"Again and again he proves under pressure why he is the best in the world. No penalty miss for this great player. Unlucky Juve, played amazing but Ronaldo showed why he is the best in the world, simply incredible calmness under pressure."
dx7gix5,Faizan24839,You could shove a dozen keepers in that net and they wouldnt have stopped that shot.
dx7i4yx,FrankCesco,"Didn't know that a match was formed only of the last minute, Juve undoubtedly played a great game and didn't deserve to loose in this way, they should have played the extra time."
dx7i92e,LeChadAussie,"He was a vulture up front today and the word I think you're looking for is 'lose'? Juve were unlucky though, played amazing! Just unlucky they ran into a guy named Ronaldo to send them out"
dx7iiiz,FrankCesco,"He could have been Ronaldo as any other player, without Buffon as goal keeper it's not a very hard thing to score as this."

dx7emc3,Dincht04,by Mehdi Benatia.
dx7f1c4,thebsoftelevision,And Buffon.
dx7ehw5,cube_mine,Still the correct call
dx7f2ue,Commandophile,I thought he meant Benatia tbf
dx7f8ni,CocoBryce,"Meh, pretty soft..."
dx7frbk,nocturn-e,A soft foul in the box is still a penalty
dx7f5x6,LuisRomario18,Doesn't make it an exciting ending tho
dx7htfg,chinookk,"That was super exciting I thought. Michael Oliver with the balls of steel, football legend Buffon loses his head and gets sent off, ronaldo blasts in a gem of a penalty and then celebrates in typical ronaldo fashion, all that in the 97th minute after about 15 minutes of Real Madrid pressure."
dx7inl6,lecollectionneur,Not as exciting as extra time or penalties.
dx7en9u,dsrii,Ruin the game by following the rules?
dx7eq6i,phdre,Foul someone at the end in the box?
dx7ey5x,fahomnom,Yup Benatia really fucked that one up
dx7ex4t,NotAllPedophiles,"Yeah, Benatia ruined the game with that shitty foul."
dx7esvq,ProfessorLupinstein,Right! Wouldn't we rather see Buffon v Ronaldo at the end there? Bullshit that Juve has to send in their backup to face that.
dx7fend,Pdeedb,There's no-one to blame for Buffons red other than Buffon.
dx7fg13,NJDevil802,Didn't he push the ref though? That has to be a red
dx7grjz,ProfessorLupinstein,"I didn't see a push. There was a large group there surrounding the ref, but I didn't see a push. I'll have to watch it again."
dx7etvm,Sandygonads,"Not really anybody's fault. Defender had to try something or it was a tap in, Ref had to give the penalty and sending Buffon off was probably the correct decision."
dx7ewny,HailHelix123,How exactly did this ruin it tho? Fuck off
dx7eeig,Koleraba,Damn hardest i got blue balled in a long time
dx7f87r,lecollectionneur,It was the best game of football I've ever watched up until thé 92th minute.
dx7fbfi,PathToTheLight,World Class cross from Kross and Ronaldo jumps like 8 feet in the air to win the ball and Vasquez on some 200+ IQ shit to win the penalty.Fair Ending to the game
dx7fi89,Kriskobg,"Yeah, by making a dumbass tackle"
dx7fn2m,Rodsoldier,Better to fix the game to make it interesting instead of making the right call ?
dx7ewei,Trailer_Park_Jihad,Shown here by Benatia.
dx7g0n5,jukesofhazard11,straight up penalty. blame benatia LOL
dx7gewu,fabienriley,No sympathy for Gigi whatsoever. You cannot scream in a refs face like that and not expect consequences. Accept the call and give your team the best chance of going through i.e. Gigi being in goal not Szczesny
dx7gw0p,mint4condition,"> Accept the call Lol at the last minute ? After a hard fought comeback ? Of course he's gonna get fucking mad, he doesn't have a slow-mo clip of the call so he's gonna think the ref made a bullshit call"
dx7h3yr,fabienriley,"Yeah, be angry, be frustrated. But expressing your frustration like that, screaming in the refs face and pushing him is going to get you sent off, any idiot with half a brain cell knows that. So why do it? Shout over at the ref, scream and swear and push the floor or posts but pushing the ref? Stupid move. He's not going to change his mind no matter how much you scream and shout. Footballers surrounding refs after decisions is a plague on the sport"
dx7hpt6,JuveGeezy,"Easy to say from the comfort of your room behind a computer screen. Should do this, should do that. No shit."
dx7hsp5,fabienriley,"Although I do agree with you, he's an experienced professional who has played over 800 professional games. He should know better."
dx7j8kh,JuveGeezy,Only flesh and blood at the end of the day
dx7jetn,javk5pakfa,Same can be said of all those people who say the ref is shit.
dx7ghaq,StallionPrime,Why the fuck should he accept a bullshit call?
dx7gmcj,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,"genuinely serious do you not believe it was a pen or do you just hate real and want to see them lose because that's what it seems like for everyone else. It was a clear pen bro, majority of the people here believe it you lot are the small minority"
dx7ho0t,StallionPrime,Fuck you
dx7hy02,fabienriley,"Good discussion, same time next week?"
dx7gnx3,fabienriley,"Because the ref isn't going to change his mind? No matter how much you scream at him, the decision was made so tough shit."
dx7gqh5,mrblue6,How many times do you see a call reversed? Wouldn't have happened
dx7hgn4,StallionPrime,Hes human. Emotions get the better of him soecially after a bad call
dx7hzhb,fabienriley,"He's also an experienced goalkeeper with over 800 professional games under his belt, he should know better."
dx7faiv,TheAuth0r,"You idiots calling it soft or not a pen have to stop. He clearly kung fu kicks Lucas in the side and never touches the ball, the ball had the same trajectory until Buffon grabbed it."
dx7el2i,Osei_OLD,Of course it was Ronaldo with the penalty👌👌👌
dx7evaj,almondania,"That's def a pen, but that sucks soooo bad for the defender. Buffon could have saved whatever shot that was gonna be put on."
dx7fl5q,halfelven23,correct call on the penaltybut that shot is ridiculous
dx7eby4,shrewdy,Christ what a penalty! Balls of steel
dx7ed10,reVenge02,Foul is foul
dx7ev43,Zation-FIFA,Its a hard decision for the ref.Would not like to be him.I accept the penalty.
dx7fcz6,FUTBOLBASKETBALLGUY,"That was a 100% goal chance intercepted by a controversial move, I'd side with the penalty kick TECHNICALLY. But the problem is if the roles were switched would he have the balls to call it and knock Real Madrid out with a call like that? I highly doubt it. That's the problem with officiating in soccer. As long as there is injustice in the way correct calls are being made, the competition is going to remain tainted."
dx7fh5z,dWaldizzle,Oliver got that call 100% correct and should be applauded for doing his job flawlessly in this game really.
dx7fmyl,nantesorkestar,He's a great referee. Buffon deserved to be sent off as well.
dx7gktm,SeyiDALegend,"Those saying it's not a penalty, how did the defender intend to get around the player to clear the ball without contact?"
dx7gr6a,monk3ybusin3ss,"This is a contact sport after all. He barely touched him ffs, trying to go for the ball. Vasquez felt him behind, and ""fell""."
dx7h6ao,SeyiDALegend,It's very difficult to calculate how much contact a player makes on another. Better to avoid contact in the box or you're giving the ref a hard decision to make.
dx86h8q,IndoIreAlco,"Yeah and better to give the ref a decision to make in this instance then let Vazquez have a shot from so close. Also Benatia thought he could obviously get any touch on the ball which would have prevented Vazquez from scoring, in fairness he wasn't too far away. Desperate situation called for a desperate action. Its a penalty but I think Benatie did what he could in situation, he had to make some kind of challenge."
dx7ed9j,marianodan,He's already falling before there's even contact lol
dx7fgwh,Mainzito,"Doesn't really change the fact that he gets 2 hands put in his back... Pretty clear foul, even if he overplays it.EDIT: Also, look at the positioning of the ball, he was definitely trying to head that ball in, which you usually do by leaning forward."
dx7f9yf,taylor-says,Still a foul though
dx7h854,TheMediumPanda,"You have GOT to be kidding me. I hate Real Madrid as much as the next guy, but it was a clear fucking penalty any day of the week."
dx7fpg4,veganfool,He was leaning forward to control the ball with his chest. Not falling over.
dx7eygl,san770,But the contact exists...
dx7ezne,emrys5,Its still a pen
dx8cem2,TaeTaeDS,Fuck off if that was your team you'd say it was a dive and was waiting for a feather
dx7f2xi,ninoxd,"So much this!!! I don't understand how people is saying that it was a pen, barely any contact"
dx7sdye,chak100,Because he is preparing for a header. Benatia pushed with both hands
dx7spmi,ninoxd,"Lol, you can't be serious, he was preparing to stop the ball with his chest, no attempt to use his head"
dx7u3dk,chak100,"What!? I see you are from Chile, I hope you know the term “palomita”, that's what he was trying."
dx7u8r0,chak100,"And you just contradicted yourself. If he was positioning his body to stop it with his ches, he wasn't going down before the tackle"
dx7wgpb,ninoxd,"And you are a madrid fan, nothing to discuss here"
dx7ze6y,chak100,"So, because I'm a Madrid fan, any point a make I moot? Brilliant"
dx7ggk5,BlipBlopBlep,"Yeah everybody in South America is saying it wasn't a penalty, even the commentators. Thing is football is a lot more physical and fought over here so something like that with minimal contact would get laughed off at by the referees. But if that play happened in midfield they'd probably call it a foul, just because."
dx7hf8q,marianodan,"Not everyone, the commentator of the game here (Martin Liberman) said it was a penalty to him but then again he's a Ronaldo fanboy, so.."
dx7higj,BlipBlopBlep,"Well, mostly everyone."
dx7elp8,Carlos1264,"Damn I fucking hate Madrid and i hate them for this moment immeasurably, but that IS A PENALTY.He kicked him in the chest come 9n."
dx7e9pp,DriftingInTheFoam,Feel bad for Buffon but I think Michael was great tonight
dx7gnrw,nocturn-e,He got himself sent off
dx7e9jx,Fivefooteightgiant,No one could have stopped that one.
dx7eary,satanlovesdogs,I TRIED SO HARD AND GOT SO FAR
dx7hfp0,gazoogle,But in the end it doesn't even matter
dx7ecbr,Repairednale,I dont deserve this kind of right before finals
dx7edfg,dustjuice,ooooooooooooooooooooooooooh bby
dx7eehj,8BallTiger,Benatia put two hands on Vazquez's back. Thats always going to be a penalty
dx7egx7,throwsdotes,That was definitely a pen. Fuxk off
dx7ehlp,warragh,How can anyone say that was not a pen? Stay classy Reddit
dx7ehmy,BonelikeDoctor,fuck everything about this but it did look a lot like a penalty
dx7ehti,Messin-About,Are people serious about that not being a pen? That's clearly some kind of foul and it's in the box.
dx7ehwb,powergs,I wanna cry... (penalty was right call tho)
dx7ei5p,SnarlinMarlin,I thought it was soft at first but looks like Benatia did not get any ball at all
dx7ekhj,Azk74,That was a perfect penalty kick by Ronaldo!
dx7emwa,masterofbeast,I listened to the second half on real madrid radio. That was heart breaking to lose that way. Wow.
dx7epf0,FUTUREEE87,"i cheered for juve but it was an obvious fault, lets be real people..."
dx7epyj,jsc__,I felt that way too much for a neutral. Gutted for them
dx7etdw,jesusofnazarith,"That really sucks the official gave Buffon a red there, heartbreaking way to end a spectacular champions league career"
dx7eyoi,wmj31,You hate to see that for Buffon
dx7f0vr,tylergwoo,It's the history of the Juventus.
dx7f522,Alajarin,"Is it just me or does Benatia get him in the chest with his foot? Giving it for the shove is soft though could go either way, but if I'm seeing it right and he does kick him there can be no question."
dx7f5iu,funnybunny22345,Gigi goes down the tunnel after a red right beside zidane who went down the tunnel with a red on his last game and gigis greatest
dx7f7yb,jedisurpriseparty,Kill me
dx7f8ii,Drak09,In a sick way i do love how Real went from being hero for getting PSG out right back to being a villians after this one.
dx7f9xg,Anonanon858,"The way Chiellini, Lichtsteiner, Benatia, Buffon and Mandzukic all take a second to process it when the red is shown before exploding again..."
dx7fath,kinginthenorthjon,Really sad to see Buffon go like that.
dx7fb9o,Batuzpisces,Juventus don't deserve to be knocked out this way but it was a correct call even if the player was playing for the penalty.
dx7fc4p,The__Upvote__King,Yesterday I loved football today I hate football
dx7fijq,ratonbox,That was such a stupid play by Benatia.
dx7fkat,tc1988,"I don't care for Real Madrid, but Benatia came from behind, and Benatia's foot was above his waist. It seems to be a clear penalty to me even though the slight shove shouldn't have knocked Vasquez over."
dx7fmm9,Torih77,"Feel sorry for Buffon, sad way to end it. He did lose it though and had to go."
dx7ftfd,RoachIsCrying,Zidane holding on to his job by his fingertips
dx7fus2,Mendax89,Michael Oliver MVP.
dx7fxj1,benharpas,Lets be simple. He clearly kicks him in the arm. Penalty.
dx7g9u4,mineirodabahia,Dats sad :(
dx7galf,XerxesAristotle,Buffon going out like Zidane
dx7gbd0,Cathal321,Best quarter finals ever
dx7gbl8,xTakusa,terrible way to end a great game smh
dx7guvt,alexsmith451,Really great penalty from Kane there to seal the tie for Real.
dx7gxw2,raf03,"Not sure what Buffon was thinking. Of all people, he should have known better that sometimes the ref makes call for your favor and sometimes against. He should remember his own comments after what he did in Muntari's ghost goal back in 2012."
dx7h838,naturally-wired,Can you imagine if the ref (rightfully) called encroachment?
dx7hk1l,thethomatoman,Not a terrible call but still pretty weak imo
dx7hq7m,WoodbrassPayPal,Anyone got Buffon's red card?
dx7jifa,Coast_watcher,90 + 7 ? I thought that only happened in videogames.
dx7jsqc,MisterVS,Only +3 and penalty was awarded within allotted minimum.
dx7m6g9,aldo__,Thing about this is that it looked like he was trying to chest the ball down to get a shot and Buffon may have had a chance to block it if he did. What a shame it ended to a call like this but all credit to Ronaldo that pen was perfect.
dx7nbsa,Shill_Borten,Gigi retiring from CL with a clean sheet. Classy.
dx7nq2l,endwolf76,"I'm so upset, could've knocked out both the Spanish giants out, and have a really interesting final"
dx7pwgx,lamTheEnigma,I love this fucking game so much
dx7ruuh,bro-ccoli1,"WHAT IS GOING ON IN CHAMPIONS LEAGUE?!?!?! What a match!!! I was stunned by Roma but I did not expect to see the kind of match this was today, oh gigi"
dx7tiy6,InsanityPlays,fuck this sucks
dx7tln6,HamsteronA,Buffon's eyes when he realises the ref is gonna card him
dx8542k,Doct3rPhil,Sad way to end the Netflix documentary
dx8g0ap,jakesonwu,Dramatic at least
dx8bp3a,lordpimmington,Was it a pen or not? I feel like a referee could give it but meh
dx8e7bk,g3ng0,No penalty
dx8eh5j,owndpepe,"Affter 20 years of absolutely nothing with Totti, the exact following year after his retirement, Roma gets a ticket for the Champions League's semifinals, after 34 years.After 20 (and more) years of no Champions League wins with Buffon, maybe the same thing will happen to Juve, who knows."
dx8kkyb,whoistheduckowner,"As much as I love Buffon, I think the reality is that if this was any other keeper then people would have a lot less sympathy for the way he reacted"
dx8v5m0,trinquin,I hate Madrid. Clear Pen though.Glad it happened to all you fuckers posting Take my energy like we're twitch chat.
dx92tin,chili01,Can someone explain how this knocked out Juventus? Even though Juventus was up 3 points?I don't know much about soccer or the UEFA rules.
dx92wlk,S4IL,The aggregate score over two games ended up being 4-3 for Real Madrid.
dx93ei1,chili01,"Ah okay, thanks!What happens if there is a draw/same score?"
dx93lnk,S4IL,"Whichever team who scores more goals away at the opponents stadium goes through to the next round. On the event of an away goals tie, then overtime and onto penalties after that if it is still level. If Ronaldo would have missed the pen, the game would have gone into overtime at 3-3 with both teams scoring 3 at their opponents stadium!"
dx940hm,chili01,"Oh wow, thanks!"
dx9gmi6,Jo17b,Who gives a fuck about an inexistant penalty? That gay dived
dx7el1d,Dylz919,"Everybody trying to say that wasn't a pen, fuckingnnlathetic.Blame benatia for that."
dx7fnnn,Force_Kush,"It's just emotions, wait till it settles down. That comeback by Juve was surreal and it sucks it ended like this, but that was the right call."
dx7eb76,yash1th,That was a penalty
dx7ffgs,electrohelal,"Definitely a penalty, not even subjective."
dx7e8gt,JagrFan88,BULLSHIT
dx7f1b9,stoner_prime,How?
dx7f3ok,lavasmoke,What exactly?
dx7fp8i,Zehmistah,Probably just wanted Juve to win. It's bullshit that theyre not through
dx7egya,random-guy410,"Clear penalty. Stupid from Benatia. Buffon completely his mind there. Great match from Juve, anyway. Didn't deserve such dramatic defeat, but a penalty is a penalty."

dx8ia7f,AjaxFC1900,"Pretty sure Madrid needed him from August to February too, you guys have to get your shit together and sell him, cannot pay an employee that much only to show up at work 50% of the season. This season is the last chance Madrid has to sell him for 175+ mil to PSG"
dx7iocu,HEELinKayfabe,Fantastic refereeing.
dx7eesq,Kazmr,Benatia thought he was in the MMA with that kick to the chest
dx7eqal,Dylkim,I wanna see some Real Madrid hating losers try to argue this wasn't a penalty. This was a clear penalty.
dx7f49h,FuzzedLogic,"Clear pen, with the aid of a replay if you still think that's not a penno there's no helping you."
dx7f6nq,devanpy,"So let me get this straight... RM player has a clear point blank shot to the goal, Benatia comes from behind and kicks him in the ribs, and some people are still outraged that it was called a penalty? As we say around here, that was a penalty here and all the way to China"
dx7fdae,melloyello23,Such an undeserved win. smh
dx7g2i0,poochiethedog,Still lost 3-1 at home.
dx7q4y0,melloyello23,"True, just sucks really. For the first time in a while I was really pulling for Juve. Real has had enough success, they can skip a year. Ya know?"
dx7fdk2,CT_x,Do we all agree it was a stonewall pen?
dx7h8vg,lambomrclago,A lot of morons in this thread think context matters when judging a foul.
dx7fwvy,arcbound_worker,"We should, but there's a lot of folks saying that it was not a penalty, somehow"
dx7e896,EnzoZidane,Penaldo!
dx7ea5z,AlphaLoner,"Really, really harsh for Juve..You've got to feel for them, they gave it everything they had.."
dx7g48s,nocturn-e,How is a rightful penalty and a deserved red harsh?
dx7i7et,AlphaLoner,"There is no arguing that that was a penalty and that Buffon deserved the red, but idk, it just breaks my heart to see Juve lose the tie in the very last minute of injury time after such an outstanding performance..It was a great tie, though, but I kinda feel the better team lost.."
dx7imgd,nocturn-e,"Did Madrid not have an outstanding performance in the first game as well?Legitimately asking, if the roles were reversed and Madrid lost at the last minute after a great performance, would you still feel the same?"
dx7l055,Tobjasz,"Juventus were underdogs, they had mission impossible and after that they were very close to make a sensational comeback. After all Juve lost after debatable penalty. People like cheering for underdogs so stop being dick."
dx7p2z1,nocturn-e,Why should the underdog have to be cheered? It seems like a dick move to want someone to lose just because they're the favorites. It's worse to lose as favorites because you're expected to win. Imagine that disappointment.
dx7f0xm,Heavens_Vibe,"How many deluded melons exist in this sub? To think that wasn't a penalty or somehow Buffon should be let off for getting into the refs face (and maybe hitting him), absolute twats some people.I really feel bad for Juve, but they know what Benatia has done to cost the penalty"
dx7fa0n,SturdyMoose,So many pussies crying over this shit. Clear pen. Fuck off.
dx7fdhq,orionpaper,Clear pen my ass.
dx7fq8u,SturdyMoose,LOL. Benatia literally knees Vasquez in the back. What more do you fucking want for there to be a call?
dx7ecl7,Into_Intoxication,I said yesterday Real Madrid always finds a way in the CL and got slewed lmao.

dx7erh3,drumsurf,Clearly a penalty. Great PK too. And I hate Ronaldo.
dx7evhx,willgeld,"Excellent penalty. But it was very soft, he was always looking to go down because he is moist, he should have just buried it. Good defending. I wish Buffon would have lamped Oliver one to get the useless cunt out of a few game weeks"
dx7evmy,Vaporwave_King,That was a softer penalty than my mom beating me when i was young
dx7ewv6,zmsz,Another 10/10 tap in
dx7eyby,SupervisorLaw,What a penalty! What a call! What a game! I'm lost for words.
dx7ez7h,Kratzie,Hate seeing Gigi get sent off but I'm play with the card there. Need far stronger stance of ref abuse. I just wish we'd see it be more consistent. You don't see the same type of aggressing on referees in other sports because they just don't allow it.
dx7f977,Greflingorax,Sad to see how many people are blinded either by hating RM or wanting extra time. Any other time in any other situation that is arguably one of the clearest penalty calls you can have outside of a defender making a diving hand-save on the line. But due to the situation it seems like people in this thread don't want a penalty for anything short of severing a limb.
dx7fbdx,Alricson,Such an obvious penalty.
dx7fe3p,Faizan24839,Benatia you fucking idiot
dx7ffkq,TheRealLance5123,"Even as a Bayern fan, this hurt bad. Juve fans we know the feeling of bad calls (Offside anyone?)"

dx7frwd,AvrupaFatihi,"Sure that might be a penalty, alltho a very soft touch. But I guess everyone is pissed because there's positions like this happening like 5 times a game and doesn't get called."
dx7fw6r,raysofdavies,"How was this not a red? I was shocked when the commentators said Buffon was off, before I saw a replay of his actions to the ref."
dx7g0ea,nekopanchi,"wouldn't be surprised if Buffon apologises for the red card and accepts the penalty after seeing the replays, he's man enough to admit he's wrong."
dx7h2dc,iamanomynous,"As some who only knows basic soccer rules, why is this good for Real Madrid? They still lost by 2 points.Edit: I get it now. Thanks for the replies. I didn't know about this score aggregation thing or that it was a second match."
dx7hb2v,zzt_zf_thz_blzz,UCL knockouts are played in two legs. Same match up played twice. The overall score is added. Madrid won the first 3-0 and lost this 1-3 which makes it a 4-3 in favour of Madrid combined. Hope this helped.
dx7hale,cord1408,"It's a champions league tie. Matches are played twice, once at each team's home grounds.So the result is determined by the combined scores of both matches, and real edged past on a total score of 4, whereas Juve had 3 goals only. Except the final. Played only once and It's held in a location not home to either. (Kiev this time)"
dx7hd4j,nekopanchi,this was the second leg they went through on aggregate
dx7h64u,Styphelus,"What do you mean they lost by 2 points? They won the first game last week 3-0. This game they lost 3-1 but when you combine both games, they won 4-3."

dx7oo12,tomascamus,"Sorry, Buffon, sorry Juventus fans, I'm not even that much of a Blanco fan but it's a penalty. Not a clear one at that, sure, but you can see Benatia pushing Vázquez with both of his hands on his back. Besides, he misses the kick on the ball later, although I don't think that to be considered dangerous play"
dx7pm55,Ekhna,"I swear on Cristiano Ronaldo's life IT IS A PENALTY, and on Harry Kanes's too"
dx83j6a,senorchaos718,"Arguably, two living legends in our lifetime. The thing that juuuust nudges C Ronaldo above Messi (imho) is how CLUTCH the guy is in key moments. Just. Always. Delivers."

dx7echz,potatosss,How is that not a pen? Not even a Madrid fan.
dx7ehoj,MotherDucker95,Because the sub wanted Juve to go through. It was a clear pen and when the dust settles everyone will see that
dx7epdr,Opie_Winston,Yeah he runs down LV from behind without getting the ball. That's a clear free kick anywhere on the pitch.
dx7eygk,starwarsVrocks,Because it's just like Madrid to have that bullshit happen.
dx7f24d,MotherDucker95,Bullshit being given a clear pen. It would have been bullshit if it wasn't called and anyone who kicked a football in their lives or played as a centre back knows that's a penalty
dx7f6j5,Narekthepotato,I think most are mad cause it's a horrible way to win.
dx7f8ms,MotherDucker95,"It is but fuck it I'll take it, I can finally breath again"
dx7gca8,Narekthepotato,Glad you are fine but I'm so fucking mad right now hahaha. I can feel Juventus pain...

dx7f6bi,Smithman,Nope. He was on the way down before contact. Joke.
dx7eiv7,The_Scar_Of_Zooch,"It was, the reactionary idiots will change their tune when everyone else does as always, they're just going with what they know will get them upvoted."

dx7eos6,Kaneco_,Guess that's why they have like 5 refs nowadays

dx7eq9m,justjamesable,"If only there were some other guys around, able to tell him their opinion.."
dx7erno,cheesynirvana,thats what the assistants are for tho
dx7es4h,HolIowed,yes we don't have more than one ref in a game
dx7eskn,NotFallingInTheTrap,"You know there are 4 other refs, right?"
dx7esmt,Ghostwritten,You do realize end line ref is just there.
dx7esj6,Mekfal,That is possibly the most dumb excuse I've ever heard. They have 5 refs looking at the same fucking place. Wake the fuck up.
dx7ekrc,helemaalnicks,"It looks a little as if the Juve player hits the ball, but it's actually the RM striker who touches the ball and Benatia only hits the striker."
dx7el6k,senorfresco,Can't make a tackle from behind like that. Asked for a penalty.
dx7eleh,SlappyBagg,"Exactly lol goes into the back of him, seems pretty clear cut"
dx7em5b,WakoJako,Drunk? Blind? Dumb? What the fk is your deal here? For real??
dx7emnd,Tmsan,"Right? I wanted Juve to win, but you can't just go shoving attackers in the back right in front of goal."
dx7en39,Winzip115,"What does it for me, I mean, what really leaves a sour taste in my mouth, is that he doesn't even try to capitalize on a goalscoring opportunity... Waits for contact, and there definitely is some but it's slight, then throws himself to the ground. He didnt bother trying to score and wouldn't have even been in that position if he had. It's a penalty but it highlights how fucking stupid the game is sometimes."
dx7eper,GabeNewellsDick,"Everyone is fuming at the ref but he made two completely fair calls. He hooks around the back of someone who's clear on goal, knocks him over, kicks him and misses the ball. I know people wanted the narrative of another amazing comeback but to me that's a pretty clear penalty and there's nothing controversial other than the timing."
dx7epx6,Mr-Pants,Every replay they've shown on BT is slow mo so I'm struggling to see how forceful the push is. If it's a proper push 100% a penalty no debate.
dx7f7pf,DrHoss,Barely any contact and he's going down before benatia even hits him. Honestly he could have probably scored if he tired instead of diving on instinct. There's no way that type of contact throws you across the penalty box if you're genuinely trying to score. Calls like this are why diving will never be eliminated in this sport
dx7gd4m,Rodsoldier,The funny thing is that i'm yet to see a Juve fan complaining.
dx7egkf,JakeFakeBreak,"For real? Minimal contact on a player that doesn't even try to shoot for goal. FfsPlus he touches the fucking ball, no way a decent ref blows that at 93"
dx7elcz,dhurley94,"He definitely didn't dive. The ball was coming at him to score the winner, how would he have known someone was coming behind him?"
dx7ejho,emaG_ehT,Minimal contact on the player. Zero contact on the ball.
dx7em5p,A_Bit_Of_Nonsense,You don't need to be swinging your leg to shoot before it's a penalty if you're fouled lmfao
dx7eplv,D_Ciaran,"My doctor told me to avoid salt, but this is so tasty."

He was clearly not going to just first time a ball at chest height, he was going to take a touch and try to smash it.Benatia could've easily just tried to poke it away on the knock down, instead he fouled him and pretty much guaranteed a goal from Penaldo."
dx7elue,shotgunlewis,delusional. benatia knows vasquez is going to score so he pushes him over.
dx7erwj,JakeFakeBreak,"Motherfucker you are on a football sub, calling me delusional for being a fan is retarded.That penalty doesn't get called 9/10 times"
dx7fr6t,shotgunlewis,"I'm not calling you delusional for being a fan. you're delusional because you're disputing something that's clearly a pen because of your fandom.There are angles where you can't see the push in the back, but if you look at all the angles it's clearly a pen, you can't go thru the back of a player like that. show me not 9, but one instance of that not being called"
dx7g3t1,JakeFakeBreak,"And that's not true, go ahead and look the post match, at Mediaset they are saying that he touches the ball clearly. They have never been biased, go ahead and look at all the angles you want, but don't start to call me delusional on a highly arguable pnealty.Edit: https://imgur.com/a/BfuVr nice penalty"
dx7gjbg,shotgunlewis,"he gets the smallest of touches but you still can't push a guy over with two hands. do you deny that he does? Only highly arguable if you're a juve fanMaybe delusional is harsh, sorry, called it biased if you like. I was reacting to the entire thread moreso than you because the most upvoted comments were saying the call was bullshit"
dx7gs0s,JakeFakeBreak,Man have you ever seen a corner kick?The pushes are part of the game. We went from a kick to his chest to just a push. Keep an open mind and resee the action. In Englad that does never get called.
dx7h21v,shotgunlewis,you see pushes in the back on corners called all the time. the only reason they aren't called more is because there's so much activity in the box that its hard to spot. fam even the top comment by a mile on the clip on the juve sub says its a foul. that would be scandalous if it wasn't called in any situation
dx7f53x,supersaiyanvaki,"You are fucking retarded American. Stick with NBA or NFL, suits you better. He almost broke his back, and the contact was made to stop him from shooting.. That IS a clear penalty. SUCK IT JUVENTUS SUCK IT BUFFON"
dx7f9ao,JakeFakeBreak,"Hey, your doctor said to keep the salt down. Try to calm down go watch some tentacle porn and chill buddy."
dx7ernw,celld,pen is a pen doesn't matter what time it is.
dx7euht,Carsonogenic,The time doesn't change that it's a foul. He goes through his back
dx7ejy5,Saadieman,You dont have to be on the verge of shooting for a penal. See a player who breaks through the last line of defense and gets caught.
dx7ekhc,BelDeMoose,Touches the ball? Please

dx7eoub,cheecheepong,Jese? lol
dx7fh8j,niner-nation,that's Lucas bro lol
dx7ewkz,The_Bread_Is_Wet,I mean the defender had to make that play and Real has dived a bit over the game. Its a boy who cried wolf situation for most of the game and this is a 50/50. * Not a ton of contact. * Went down a bit too easily. * The defender should be allowed to make that defensive play in that situation.Its 50/50 and it could have gone either way but I would have been happier to see it go into extra time
dx7eww3,Wildelocke,"I'm not a fan of either team. But its not a foul to have your right arm contact another player. There is no push. And he got the ball. It's *incredibly* soft, especially given that there was no scoring opportunity apparently (as there was no red)."

dx7egv0,supaboss2015,He's saying For the sending off dude. Not the penalty
dx7enrd,Eltits_DingleEds,no one would've saved that pen anyways
dx7eyi2,StandardDefinition,Uhh what?
dx7f1vn,supaboss2015,He is saying fuck off for sending Buffon off. He is not saying fuck off for the pen. Can you not read?
dx7f440,StandardDefinition,Your original comment had no such distinction
dx7fbq3,supaboss2015,Apologies that was a typo
dx7ej3w,schillin,???? Really? One of the softest pens I've seen
dx7ej0l,gart888,"Yeah... he goes down easily, but that has to be a penalty."
dx7ek49,Dizzeebiscuit,He tackled him from behind and Vasquez had control of the ball. Penalty
dx7f337,Jeffy29,"It was always penalty, I don't think anybody will argue against it, just that it was insanely fucked up. Buffon with Zidane retirement."
dx7efse,Banskyi,"It is, just shitty to have it called in extra time Edit- I meant from the point of view of someone watching the fucking game and wanting to see a better finish to itAlso should have said have it happen*"
dx7ehg5,jetlifevic,Then don't make stupid challenges
dx7ei76,treasy21,If it's a pen in regular time it's a pen in extra time
dx7f43s,Banskyi,"lol I meant it from a neutral viewers perspective, I wanted to see extra time"
dx7ei9w,-AnnoyedGuy-,A penalty is a penalty.....that's a dumb argument.

dx7eimw,falkous,He should not have called it because it was extra time?
dx7f0ke,Banskyi,lol I meant it from a neutral viewers perspective Everyone took it the wrong way
dx7enod,thatdude0125,Benatia shouldnt have made that challenge.
dx7emdc,RJSSUFER,you dont call a borderline pen with no time on the clock. horrible way for the match to end
dx7eine,Lsatter17,It's like that Suarez dive last year. way too soft.
dx7en4d,brownboy73,"He is pushed from the back, blocked by knee in the front when he could have easily made contact with the ball. Yeah right, that's soft."
dx7f2a9,Lsatter17,"I think you can call it either way tbf, but for me that's way too soft."
dx7ejhl,Random_Acquaintance,Very very soft. You can call that in the midfield. But that's not a pen for a last minute in a knockout stage.
dx7eqb7,M4NUN1T3D,Two handed push with his leg hitting lucas' stomach
dx7ewsb,Random_Acquaintance,"Benatia barely pushes Lucas he feels the contact and goes down. Benatia's leg actually looks for the ball, but ends up contacting both since Lucas was going down. Again, I see the foul but UEFA reffs normally look to the other side in this kind of stages at a so soft pen. It's callable, but then there has been 10 other pnealties in boths areas during the game."
dx7eia7,Charlie_Yu,"pen or not is debatable, but the red is a disgrace."
dx7enfc,iNen1,2 goalies wouldnt have saved that shot.
dx7fb4v,Charlie_Yu,It is not about saveable or not. Ronaldo made a great shot. But Buffon doesn't deserve the red.
dx7fhly,iNen1,Watch how he reacted to the ref. He screamed at him AND got physical. We dont even know what he said to the ref. A red is understandable at the very least
dx7ed0e,Ante_Up_LFC,It was a foul...
dx7ecr8,AVirtualDuck,Sucks that Benatia can't control his legs
dx7ehzm,JonstheSquire,Or his arms.
dx7ftlt,Stan_Baniszewski,what? he barely touched him with his hands for like a tenth of a second
dx7fzlj,JonstheSquire,Show me where in the rules it says that it is okay to push an opposing player in the back as long as you only do it for a short time. https://img.fifa.com/image/upload/datdz0pms85gbnqy4j3k.pdf
dx7gqtg,Stan_Baniszewski,Show me where in the rules it says that the referee should award a penalty for every light touch that occurs in the penalty area.
dx7h362,JonstheSquire,"Law 9:A direct free kick is awarded to the opposing team if a player commits any of the following seven offences in a manner considered by the referee to be **careless**, reckless or using excessive force:• kicks or attempts to kick an opponent• trips or attempts to trip an opponent• jumps at an opponent• charges an opponent• strikes or attempts to strike an opponent• **pushes an opponent**• tackles an opponent**A penalty kick is awarded** if any of the above ten offences is committed by a player inside his own penalty area, irrespective of the position of the ball, provided it is in play.It is black and white. A referee must award a penalty for a careless push in the penalty area."
dx7j6z2,Stan_Baniszewski,Fine then. Let's totally ban physical contact in football and give dozens of penalties in every match. At every corner kick you can see a lot of pushes in the pentaly area worse than that.
dx9nhaa,JonstheSquire,I agree with you that there is way too little enforcement of the rules on fouls which occur during almost every dead ball situation when the ball is played into the box. There should be way more penalties called for what is now routine conduct during corner kicks.
dx7g0io,sebas8181,or his arms

dx7ei5i,Ainsyyy,But Oliver was good and is generally good
dx7eeeo,RichieFinn,No Michael Oliver sucks. He always bottles a big game. Was letting Ronaldo dive all night. And gave a very very harsh penalty
dx7esnu,jAlvesrz,One of the best refereeing so far don't know what you are on about mate.
dx7eswy,PM_ME_BAKAYOKO_PICS,"The penalty wasn't harsh at all, that's a clear penalty any day of the week."
dx7elwv,SacrificialPizza,How in the hell is that harsh? You'd be shitting yourself if that wouldn't have been called against your team
dx7ep2r,RichieFinn,Behind the goal angle says it al. Fingertips on his back and he falls like a fairy
dx7eiwz,SPRneon,>very very harsh.lol this was rightfully a penalty
dx7f3mr,OSU31UM20,you'd literally suck ronaldo's dick to have him back. stfu you crying babies jesus christ
dx7fe9k,RichieFinn,Yea good argument mate. Youre clearly 11
dx7ebrl,creative_penguin,"How the fuck can you call that when you have to be certain it's a foul? Absolutely disgraceful. Edit: I completely disagree that that is a foul. Does he touch him? Yes, of course. Is this a contact sport? Yes, of course. I personally don't think there is anywhere near enough for this to be called a foul."
dx7eguh,danny321eu98,Disgrace would be not calling a pen when there was one
dx7ei1j,Nick-Tr,It doesn't matter if it's at the 1st or 91st minute. A penalty's a penalty

dx7epvb,wzurd,I'm fairly sure he was certain sine it clearly was a penalty.
dx7euoo,LdouceT,"Well he must have been pretty certain. He had a great angle, and it was a stonewall penalty."
dx7ehyo,TooSwissToWrestle,"I mean, it certainly was"
dx7ehdq,JimmyJamesincorp,"Fuck Real too, it's always like this."
dx7fkxb,Sandy_Emm,"Why though? It was a pen clear as day, and no one, not even Buffon can get away with treating the ref like that. Ronaldo got a 5 match suspension for lightly pushing the ref 8 months ago."
dx7fno2,JimmyJamesincorp,"It wasn't a pen, the guy goes down without reason, football is a contact sport which tolerates touching without harm, specially in the box.This is a pen because it's fucking Madrid."
dx7gpip,Sandy_Emm,"This is wrong, you are wrong. Vazquez gets pushed from behind and the defender wrapped his leg around him and hit his chest. In any league, in any country, this is a pen. Just because you don't like that it's Madrid won't change the rules."

dx7epo5,Marco772,People are fucking blind lol. How is that not a penalty?
dx7ey2h,sw1rv,"the amount of biased losers is unreal, the referee called it like he would at any other time in any other game which is how it should be. you don't want your sport to become the NBA when the game is completely refereed different in the last minutes"
dx7gmil,yayayaja,Yeah would love for Game 7 of the NBA Finals to end with free throws.
dx7e88c,Revanxv,Juve got robbed.
dx7egxq,lclear84,Imo Juve got tired and fouled like it lol. Benatia definitley kicked and pushed him
dx7gd93,VodkaHappens,"He had just gotten a yellow before, I think the nerves were getting the best of him."
dx7gifr,portomerf,"I agree. I know most people in these threads are going to just be reactionary and post memes, but Zidane actually made good changes and saw out the game pretty well imo. We were having trouble bringing the ball to Juve's box because of the aggressive pressing, but bringing on the extra midfielders and trying to gain more possession was wearing them out big time. We were passing around sideways because we couldn't penetrate, but they were still having to chase and it was leaving more gaps towards the end. If it went to extra time I think we would have scored even more goals. Very similar to what happened in that final vs Atleti where they were exhausted and we trashed them in extra time."
dx7grda,TheMediumPanda,"Nobody mentioned that but it's entirely correct. They last 10-15 minutes they were spent and defended way too deep. Real might have had a poor showing but they're not a chump team. As much as I wanted them to go out, they looked MUCH more likely to score than Juve."
dx7ef3c,,[deleted]
dx7erie,Mildly-relevant,"I agree. Glad to see a ref with a pair of balls to give a penalty if thinks it is one no matter the consequences. The red card looked very justified as well. I honestly applaud Oliver, even though I was hoping for the Juve comeback."
dx7el0x,Schnabeltierchen,Just a really unfortunate outcome at the very last minute and Buffon getting sent off as well even if it was the right decision
dx7eshe,phdre,Buffon's send off is his own responsibility.
dx7f30m,Schnabeltierchen,Wasn't saying otherwise
dx7fwur,ISCOREDwithISCO,So...Juve robbed themselves.
dx7eu2p,SZJX,Vazquez sold it. He was falling all the time instead of really going for the shot.
dx7fxw5,sebas8181,How is [pushing](https://imgur.com/3bdcXNw) and [kicking in the chest not a foul](https://imgur.com/Ns6stec)?
dx7f1dr,Smithman,There's an alternate angle showing he went down before contact.
dx7er90,made4schief,"Yeah, agreed.. just an unfortunate way for Juve to go out after how well they played tonight to claw themselves back into this tie"
dx7f4mw,Kloncs,"Where is the foul exactly? Benatia is going for the ball all the way, and he is barely touching Vazquez, who is already going down before the contact."
dx7fz0v,sebas8181,[Here ](https://imgur.com/3bdcXNw) and [here](https://imgur.com/Ns6stec)
dx7o8mq,PhillyFreezer_,Lol 2 hands in the back and lunged from behind leaving both feet and a boot high. You're delusional if you think it wasn't a foul
dx8ccax,Kloncs,"One hand in the back. His foot is balls high as he aims for the ball. He glances Vazquez with his left boot. If this is a penalty, then they have to start to call the foul every time two players is in an airduel and every time a shirt is grabbed in the box. In an airduel no one ever hits the ball only - arms and legs are waving around, it's impossible not to touch each other under such circumstances."
dx7f385,-JKN-,"I'm not even sure Benatia touches the player, people act as if he comes right through him"
dx7ercg,deepstatehoax2018wow,very rarely called in such situations
dx7fckr,Jeffy29,"It was always penalty but you can't help to feel they got robbed. Such a heroic performance, I was already picturing Buffon lifting the trophy, and then it ended just like that. What an AMAZING game."

dx7u2br,Fromgre,https://streamable.com/ft51kYou can literally see his body shift right when Benatias leg hits him.

dx7edr1,Skrrrrt2000,why are ppl complaining? its a clear pen
dx7ezv0,udiniad,Because they are either a Barca fan or just plainly hate Real
dx7elhl,rbddit,"This is the world we live in now, we acknowledge that players intentionally go down (diving) but beside they were slightly touched it's foul. Contact sport?"
dx7gdvv,Mandalf_the_Guy,The defender has to realize that going for that challenge and not being clean with it has a high percentage of being called a penalty especially the way Benatia went in
dx7gk2y,gazeebo,"And the four times or so Ronaldo intentionally goes down, there's no cards. Dybala in the other leg, cards for everything. Yay fair refs."
dx7fixx,taylor-says,"He could of stayed on his feet,but that's a pen all day long"
dx7fkm6,rbddit,So did he intentionally go down?
dx7fom3,taylor-says,"Yes, because he got fouled. You're trying to be awkward but it was a very obvious penalty, stop watching football if you want to see people Stay on their feet at all costs (even when it gives the ref more of a chance to make the wrong decision)"
dx7gdwq,rbddit,Wait. So touching a players back is a foul? He barely put any pressure on him but because he felt hands he dived
dx7gtg7,taylor-says,"He sprinted into his back, then wrapped his leg round him. Yeah he went down easy, but It's a foul anywhere on the pitch no matter the minute or the competition"
dx7hi53,rbddit,"He tried kicking the ball and his leg went across, by that time he was already falling to the floor"
dx7hl7e,taylor-says,"He TRIED to kick the ball, missed, instead wrapped his leg around and pushed him in the back. Penalty. Every. Day. Of. The. Week."
dx7hpjc,rbddit,"Maybe you're right, if you are it just shows how pathetic professional football has become"
dx7hqkk,taylor-says,"As I said, switch sport my guy."
dx7hxji,rbddit,Nah
dx7hzoz,taylor-says,"Then accept it a pen all day long, or be pissed off with the decisions given every week. Btw that would of been a pen 10 years ago too"
dx7i2dw,rbddit,"I'm not even saying it's not a pen, I'm saying it's sad that it is a pen"
dx7i8x3,taylor-says,"I'm not sure if you play football, but if you do surely you know that if you're trying to chest the ball down and shoot as soon as possible, getting pushed in the back (no mater how lightly) and having a leg wrap around you that doesn't touch the ball will completely ruin your balance and consequently if you manage to get a shot off, you've lost most of your control as you're off balance. If you look at it that way, you should see that a pen is the fair decision as well as the right one"
dx7icoa,rbddit,"But that isn't what happened. He wasn't pushed, he was touched, and his leg went around him to kick the ball, just because his leg touched him as he reached off it doesn't mean he wrapped it around him"

dx7fur6,pedroshoemaker,Twitter is a shit show everyone claiming it's not a penalty
dx7fzls,marv257,"I'd say it's a 50/50 call at most, to me at least 75/25 no penalty, especially with what the ref let pass throughout the game..."
dx7g6zt,pedroshoemaker,I see where you're coming from however you can't just swing your foot across another players chest especially in the box that's just downright foolish
dx7gxdy,lambomrclago,"Every pundit/ex player I've seen in the time since has said its a pen. If he doesn't impeded the player he taps it in, I don't know what wasn't clear about it."
dx7haev,marv257,"The ones on German Sky say it's 50/50 call and if it's not a sure penalty, you don't call it in this moment."
dx7ww0w,lambomrclago,Can't agree with that - unobstructed that is as simple as a tap in/finish that you like. He touched the attacker even if he goes down softly it is a pen.
dx7g67o,unimpeccable,Did anyone see if Higuain was playing this game?
dx7jjpd,javk5pakfa,"He did and he went down as easily as many Real players. Ref gave soft calls on both ends and in the end, a lapse of concentration in Juve's defense costed them the match."
dx7lmba,unimpeccable,I was more referring to the fact that he seems to just not be an offensive threat in big games. I can only recall him getting one snapshot off during the entire game.
dx7n7fm,javk5pakfa,"Which means the other team did a great job muting him. Then again, every team has one or two players that have that special something, which is only shown in tight fixtures like this. Why are Messi and Ronaldo so good? It's less about the goals they scored against lesser teams but more about their ability to capitalize on few chances in big clashes. A normal striker can score one goal with every ten great chances, but those two can score from one if given one."
dx7gy7j,johnyann,It's definitely a penalty. But lets consider it this way. That was not enough contact to take down Vazquez the way he went down.
dx7htug,yslithal,🐐🐐🐐
dx7i7gy,RF7991sen,"I don't think Vasquez was already going down. I think he was trying to control or play the ball with his chest (hence why he was leaning forward) and then the defender hits him from the back. It would have been a foul anywhere else on the field in my opinion. So yeah, I think it's a PK."
dx803pd,MisterVS,Plus you can see him shifting and adjusting his right leg when contact happened.
dx7j63u,1guywithlonghair,"everyone criticizing , but you all realize that it was a fucking insane game . who knows when we will fill so intense feel :D"
dx7kczd,wazoaki,Seeing Buffon crack like that in his last ever game in the CL really really fucking broke my heart.
dx7pffm,Mitchk574,"What a penalty.! The amount of pressure on Ronaldo in that moment and he smashes it top corner. Michael Oliver made the right call with the penalty and the red card imo.I think Vasquez made it look a little more theatrical than it needed to be, but it was definitely a foul. I am a huge fan of Gigi and it'll be a very sad day for football when he hangs up his gloves, but you cannot do that to a referee."
dx7t1vt,LoveRBS,I told my Juventus fan coworker this - it was probably a penalty - but probably should have let it go.I liken it to basketball - in a buzzer beater type situation a foul is usually never called unless it was blatant.So yea the ref was absolutely right. But I think he should have just been wrong.
dx7irgb,the_aamir,"Chellini mocking Madrid players that they paid the ref. such an awful behaviour from him, lost all respect. I hope UEFA takes some action against it. How in the world would RM pay the ref when they already had the lead from the first leg. Or did they made the transaction while on the field. I'm just curious chellini?"
dx7sv6g,TuneyTune92,Get off your fucking high horse. Of course he overreacted - but its rich coming from a madrid supporter. Look at the way your captain behaved last year in the final with the shameful dive/overreaction against Cuadrado. Ronaldo was flopping all day.

dx7h518,Majukun,"the main mistake here is a lack of communicaton between the juve defenders..sandro (i think?) doesn't follow chiellini and the other defender that are rising the line to put everyone in offside,so he ends up with ronaldo that passes him with great timing and has no choice but to follow him,but the rest of the defense line just isn't there anymore to cover the cross and benatia has to attempt a last desperate save.for the penalty i already said mine in the match thread...benatia's leg touches the ball but his hands are on the realmadrid guy's back and that's what the referee saw..whenever it's penalty or not depends on if the ""shove"" before the leg touches the ball is strong enough to damage the attacker (that does nothing to stay on his feet but it is his right to do so if the push was strong enough)..a difficult call to make without var and not easy even with var..an ex referee on a italian show is saying that if benatia touches the ball it can never be penalty,and he has obviously more experience than me..but i think that if the shove happened and happened before the leg touched the ball, there's ground for a penalty.funny thing...juve's chairman released an interview where he said that uefa should hurry implementing VAR in champions league since this kind of episodes change the fate of the entire tournament...but i remember clearly back at the start of serie A, when VAR was something new even for us italians..juve players and managers said that it was a damage for football and that with VAR ""it isn't football anymore"".how opinions change when you are the one damaged...."
dx7hn0i,Zack_Fair_,one day I'll be jaded and stoic enough to accept horseshit like this. But today is not that day. Right up there with the Totti red / denied pen. sad
dx7hzsi,OnePeat,Gigi :( <3
dx7iuur,the_aamir,Football is a cruel game.
dx7ixkl,Edmaster1215,Testing flair
dx7oy87,CreeepyBug,"What a beautiful, emphatic finish. Nerves of steal we are seeing here."
dx7s2tz,MagicStar77,"IMHO the better team won 3 to 0, until penalty."
dx832dr,lak47,Thata a fucking assault by Benatia.
dx863dy,amlc98,Finally people who think rationally. It was an absolute penalty.
dx7ebtu,tietherope,Celebrates like he did anything other than a penalty all match.
dx7f5w3,Emptinessenthralls,"Well, he did score the goal that got them qualified for the semi finals.."
dx7fsyb,Manlad,He did create the chance that lead to the penalty by heading it back across goal.
dx7g2gb,sebas8181,He was the only at RM trying. Cry me a river.
dx7ewnr,brnmc,Well he scored the decisive goal.
dx7erym,dohhhnut,"LMAO fuck off as if you wouldn't celebrate scoring the goal that puts you through to the semis, have people here never played a game?"
dx7gvwu,InBrovietRussia,Fucking Canadians smh.
dx7hhtb,danawasnevermyfriend,No. It's r/soccer.
dx7ewzh,tietherope,"I didn't criticize the fact he celebrated, just the way it was done."
dx7g4pw,dohhhnut,Did you have a problem with Messi taking off his shirt when he won the classico?
dx8qaih,tietherope,"Had it been so he could flex his muscles, absolutely."
dx7f3sz,Tuke17,What? Should he not celebrate scoring a winning goal to semi-finals just because he didnt do much in the game?
dx7gmrh,nocturn-e,Yeah fuck him for being happy he scored a crucial penalty in a close match
dx7f2d3,JokeSportGuy,"Eh their fans will treat it like a total route. Douche team, douche fans"
dx7f16f,striceheron,"It's hard to believe that his celebration was the most infuriating part of the whole situation, but it was. God, he makes it really hard to like him."
dx8dby4,Golden_Draco,How are you this salty it's hard to believe to be honest
dx7e9ag,xDomox,"not deserved, just my 2 cents"
dx7fbuf,alexfrompanama,"You have to play over two legs though. How is this not deserved? Sure, Juventus was better this second half but Real Madrid was even better in the first leg."
dx7etz7,sm0r3ss,did you not watch the first leg?
dx7g5uh,HrtSmrt,Did you watch the 2nd?
dx7pf9a,Manlad,Where they sealed the tie? Yeah.
dx7e8fw,kwa9,God damn it
dx7eu3v,Galgenfrist,*waits for Kane to claim the goal*
dx7f6tp,rainbow0o,I don't think Buffon deserved a red card.
dx7fd8x,LaRemontada,This kills the Juve
dx7fu4u,sm0r3ss,"Hala Madrid, and Forza Juve! Such a great game. Juve clearly deserved more, and honestly both teams deserve the win from performances in each leg. But i do think it was a penalty.. the balls from the ref to actually call it tho considering the circumstances."
dx7gyo5,rohaanahmed11,"Buffon should have headbutted ref, that would have been perfect."
dx7hn3v,ankeiii,"Poor Buffon. Had a stellar career, but last CL game get screwed over by UEFA/referee"
dx7io4o,plsmemberthisone,"""hmmm.. I haven't done much this game.. If I score this I still might not get the headlines. Best take my top off..."
dx7itcu,renome,"""Football is fucking unbelievable."""
dx7e8vg,ripper8244,Fuck this...
dx7eb7j,yungwave,Great penalty. Don't even love football but will be sad when Ronaldo retires.
dx7eqiw,SleepyDani,Messi would've choked.
dx7er3s,NZ_Diplomat,"Feel really bad for Juve and Gigi, but c'mon guys, it was clearly a foul. A soft one, but a foul nonetheless. Can't blame the refs for this one."
dx7ewga,,[deleted]
dx7ezpx,theglasscase,"There's clearly a shove before the ball reaches him, and then Benatia kicks up around his chest without touching the ball."
dx7f99w,seaocean87,Ronaldo is amazing but it's crap like how he celebrated under such bs circumstances that will forever keep me a hater.
dx7fbdg,Red-Tom,He's just put his team through to the semi finals after almost losing. Can't expect him to stand there like a lemon
dx7flco,seaocean87,"Class my friend class, shirt throw and posing was too much. Zidane knows what's up."
dx7fhih,alejpaz,To be fair it was a really good pen
dx7fi5d,likeastar20,+1 Ronaldo is a cry baby on the pitch
dx7f9jc,TomCosella,"That's a penalty. Buffon probably deserved the red as well. Sorry, but after what I saw in the Spurs/Juve matchup, Serie A defending seems to be closer to rugby than football."
dx7frfx,krisburturion,"That was a scintillating 90 minutes utterly ruined by the last few minutes. Real Madrid deserve no respect for this, and if they were capable of shame they would be feeling it now."
dx7iy10,Johnnysmith69,No respect for something Benatia did...
dx7ierg,ThePeoplesBard,Can someone help me out as a soccer noob? Why does everyone in this thread feel badly for Juventus? Didn't they still win by two goals?
dx7ip3m,Yinzumaru,"Because it's a two game elimination, One game on juve home and One in madrid, Madrid won 3 0 in italy so, lost in Madrid 1 3 but in The aggregate score, they won 4 3, hope i helped."
dx7iuy4,ThePeoplesBard,"Wow. Every ounce of my American perspective on sports gets squeamish about this and wants a best of three. My skin is crawling. I don't want to pretend my perspective is ""right""...this just sounds SO strange."
dx7km10,Suboptimal_Clearance,"Its not that strange when you consider it as a total goals competition, with 90 minutes at one venue and 90 at the other. Its gets a bit cloudy when you get to the tiebreakers, but the American NBA/MLB approach of best of 5 or 7 also has its faults."
dx7l6q5,ThePeoplesBard,You're absolutely right. There's no perfect system. I just had to express how *weird* this sounded. I'll try to learn to love it.
dx7jaxh,Yinzumaru,"Idk Man, its always been like this, group stage then 2 game eliminations till The finals that its just One game, idk, im south American, maybe thats why for me its so normal hahahah"
dx7iih8,,"They lost over two games, because the first ended 0-3 for Real Madrid in Turin. Tonight's 1-3 for Juventus Turin in Madrid was not enough and is only half the story."
dx7fo4u,Vegoran,"I wouldn't even be mad if Juve managed to win, but this was a clear penalty. And what an amazing kick from Ronaldo"
dx7fvqg,kurzjacob,In what world is that a clear penalty?
dx7g3at,Vegoran,He pushed and kicked him.
dx7g878,haymaker453,It isn't a penalty by any definition.
dx7g6yc,kurzjacob,He barely makes contact.
dx7gg87,Silversoth,In the one where you don't jump and kick hitting the other player on the arm at shoulder level. Not to say that Lucas Vazquez doesn't let himself drop extra easily.
dx7esgr,onemangoboi,What a fucking shame for football this was.
dx7eton,nomameswe,And they call suarez a diver. That was not a fucking penalty he got the ball as he made contact.
dx7fosf,Tepozan,Clear penalty. You are literally the only person disagreeing here
dx7gomk,LSSN,One of the best penalty kicks I have ever seen. In the 97th minute to decide the tie. Wow.
dx7h7dn,lambomrclago,Everyone saying its not a penalty is delusional. How about you don't barge into the guy with a tap in at the end of the game and you won't concede a penalty.
dx7hh0r,BlondedSeigfried,"UEFADRID, he falls like a feather"
dx7irzv,Chemache,"that wasnt enough for a pen, Vazquez helps way too much"
dx7k328,thedudeabides10188,Still can't believe this ref..... No balls to give Rinaldo a call for diving..the whole game the same shit...
dx7oxr2,Marchinon,Classic Penaldo
dx7eyzd,,[deleted]
dx7guvg,Toavc,"It is from behind, hands on the back, the leg coming around Vazquez and kicking him in the side. Did we see the same foul?93rd minute doesn't matter, he fouled him, stupidly, and was punished accordingly."
dx7fofs,iTLOP,"???? How people are still disputing this penalty call is beyond me, it's 100% a penalty, no doubt about it"
dx7fvbg,,[deleted]
dx7g0ax,iTLOP,"Yeah it is soft, and a very disappointing end for Juventus considering they played so well the whole game. This happens in football sometimes :'("
dx7ffva,cokecaine,Call was good. Plenty of contact.
dx7gas5,noodlebirdbrain,"lol...? let the players decide the game? Who fucking cares if it's minimal contact, it's still a foul in the box you absolute mong"
dx7f9f7,alextastic,Biggest load of shit I've ever seen.
dx7ea9g,Riahisama,What a joke
dx7lmec,bcm311,Milan is the real joke.

dx7eg4h,themubz,What an end. God damn.

dx7ejtw,prraaa,For the sake of football don't upvote this shit.
dx7ejv0,torosFCP,Proper call. Can't being going through the back of somebody to get to the ball.
dx7ek1a,etsuited,"He didn't need to make that challenge. Was going to be on his chest, he wouldn't have had a clear first time shot so I'd fancy Buffon would have saved it anyway."
dx7ek2x,Srecocovic,I honnestly never hate a team more than i do now with Real... Or should i hate bthe ref or The football gods?God i love football..

dx7elhm,idk108,I 100% couldn't have been a player. I would have snapped the ref in half and probably started a riot.
dx7ellf,libertod,for me the penalty is soft
dx7eloh,Heliotex,Oh these comments are going to be good.
dx7em3x,iAruban,"im really not sure if that was a pen, he wouldnt have time to shoot either way since he was trying to control it with his chest while benatia was already super close to him"

dx7en4c,Danielfifa1337,PISS RIGHT FUCKING OFF
dx7en5k,DontKnoName,Come on Snjezni you have to save that
dx7eng3,creativeself_,Hello /r/all
dx7enj2,pjsol,Zidane is red carded in his last match in World Cup and loses to Buffon. Buffon is red carded in possibly his last match in CL and loses to Zidane. (semi final though)
dx7eny5,Outten,That's a pen for me. I understand it isn't the fairy tale most of you guys wanted and emotions running high but come on you can't come in around the back and not even get the ball like that in the box. It's a foul no question.
dx7eo1a,RedMoon14,"I hate it because I wanted Juve to go through, but sadly Michael Oliver made the right call."

dx7ep04,maxoys45,Wtf was Benatia doing.... cretin

dx7es9x,masetheace97,"It sucks that Buffon has to go out like this, but how is anyone bitching at the ref for calling the pen?

dx7etc8,yeldo23,What a fucking pen
dx7etci,coolfir3pwnz,That match was so emotionally demanding.
dx7etg6,sodenj5,Vazquez was sitting on an open goal and literally had the defender climb on top of him. At that point you're just hoping the ref doesn't have the balls to blow a whistle to decide the game. He did.

You have to ban straight red cards, make penalty decisions super stricter, otherwise refs will always take the game into their hands and we miss the whole beauty. I mean, I'm neither Juventus nor Real, but this decision was quite controversial for a match of this calibre. I'm really tired of switching off the tv in such crucial matches. I'll update this post with controversial decisions that have ruined the game for me in CL late stages."
dx7f1fg,Dacros,Buffon should've just punched the guy in the face before walking off. Or headbutt him in the chest. This feels terrible for Juve.
dx7f1jq,LGAMER3412,You got to be kidding me
dx7f1qa,fredewio,"That was a goal if Benatia didn't fault, so either way Real deserved to go through, even if they played quite worse."

dx7f1yj,king_king123,My heart goes out to Buffon and the whole Juve team. That's not how you wanna lose a knockout tie.
dx7f1z1,FallenHorizons,Madrid: just a prank vro lol
dx7f24y,just_for_fun367,"Laughing out loud at anyone doubting the penalty. It was 100% the right call! This sub seems to always be rooting against Real, ridiculous."
dx7f2im,dURRENRM,the feeling when u can unclench after 90mins of ass whopping
dx7f2lc,KAMATCH,"Only half joy with such manner.Rly didnt like the way Ronaldo celebrated after the respect Juve fans showed him, we were losing 3-0 go get the ball to the center and show respect back."
dx7f2pt,melancious,So sad for Buffon. What a legend.
dx7f2vu,Tadamo1,"Didn't really think it was a penalty, could've went either way but because it was literally at the end he should've left it and let the game roll into extra time."
dx7f2xc,donniexc,And that's why there are no English referees in the World Cup.
dx7f331,bvb19mA,Could have been killed.
dx7f38f,BenAMDavidson,I hate football at times
dx7f38i,Trickybuz93,"Once again, the refs behind the goal prove how fucking useless they are"
dx7f39k,HOFSheamus,What a fn foke
dx7f3i0,Lucifer_xD,"Pathetic, what a shame."
dx7f3i4,helmut-schnaugenberg,I'm surprised Buffon stayed this calm after the red. There was no reason not to go full Zidane.
dx7f3ln,Lxqo,I've looked at all the AA angles and must be missing something.. Why was Buffon sent off? For shouting at the ref? Benatia committed the foul. And where did the 8 minutes of stoppage time come from if there was only 3 added?
dx7fdli,rainbow0o,the 8 mins were from the penalty call basically
dx7f3uk,deadkestrel,"Nearly 2k comments in 10minutes, holy moly"
dx7f47d,EC_74,Wait what did Buffon do to get sent off? Did he say something to the ref or am I missing something? Am I blind?
dx7f81w,Hollandrock,Touched the ref while swarming him (from behind)
dx7f4t8,Sjsvb,Lol I wanna die
dx7f4vz,Move_Over_Rosa_Parks,Whenever I go over to my grans and she taps me on the shoulder it usually absolutely blasts me the the floor so I totally see how that was a pen.
dx7f51p,BashTheBlu,What a beautiful sport
dx7f5en,INdragoneXS,"There penalty was there but how to make sure it doesn't get saved, ohh yeah let me give Buffon a red card for good measure. I don't think CR7 would have taken a penalty so nice if he was shooting vs Buffon."
dx7f5ot,GreyMatter22,"As a Real Madrid fan since I was a little kid, what an unbelievable game Juve played away from home. Gigi Buffoon played his heart out, and I wish this tale didn't have to end like that.Last minute penalty is such a sad way to go, for whatever it is worth, nothing but respect to Juventus."
dx7f6a0,SZJX,Well after all eventually on the balance maybe RM still deserved to win the tie. Also the third goal was a Navas drop. But it's just so harsh for Juve.
dx7f6a4,hashtagPLUR,Refball
dx7f6b0,Davetology,"Really soft pen, pretty much 50/50 but of course they had to pick the most controversial one.."
dx7f84k,Conspiranoid,"Does someone have a gif of the first replay of the penalty? Like, I see some people saying he was already falling/flopping before the contact, but I can't really see it, he just reacts to the push to the back..."
dx7f84r,MischifManaged,It's devastating to see Buffon sent off like that especially if it turns out to be his last. But honestly the ref had no choice. Doesn't matter the situation you can't get in the ref face like that.And props to Ronaldo for an unstoppable penalty
dx7f879,PhantomTrouper,"Benatia totally kicked the player. Not a RM fan and I really wish Juve would go to the next round, but it was an obvious penalty."
dx7f9ns,Ashitakaa,Lol I am amazed how people say 200% penalty watching this angle this replay.Give the angle from the back...
dx7fa7a,HerrLanda,"Guys i didnt watch the game, wtf happened? Did Real performed badly, or Juve just gave their best, or both?"
dx7facm,fgdadfgfdgadf,Really need another camera angle to judge it
dx7fbm2,the_man_who_comments,I was hoping Szczęsny would chokeslam Ronaldo so he couldn't take the penalty.
dx7fbw5,MadridFC,"men, what a game, I actually wanted it to go extra time but that mistake from gigi make it impossible."
dx7fc6i,CrazyRed98,Who's got the two hands on back of Lucas video? I need it.
dx7fcc9,ionelp,"If Roma draws Real and win, that will be a very conflicting matter for Juve fans"
dx7ffjx,bbkalaba,Thought benatia sold the push quite well lmao
dx7fh4w,m0cl0v,Good game. Good call by ref
dx7fini,Samytoch22,"If he saved that i would of gone to Madrid and kissed him but no , Ronaldo back at it again with pens"
dx7fjqb,existentialmentalist,So damn close. Might be for the best though cause Bayern would have had an easy final.
dx7fkc6,Urumik04,Of course he did.
dx7fljn,TMaier16,"I know it's heat of the moment, but tbh Benatia shouldn't have gambled and just let Vasquez control the ball"
dx7fln6,BDKallday,What did Buffon do/say for the red?
dx7fm1u,NaughtyProwler,"Want some VAR. There was a reverse angle they showed for a split second that definitely made it questionable. Not saying it's not a penalty, but that decision needs more angles and less on field drama driving the final decision."
dx7fmen,send_me_2,But Juve won second time there since -62 or something?
dx7fpgj,belgianbadger,"I'm so hoping real draws bayern and gets their teeth kicked in. But much as I hate to say it, penalty was the right call."
dx7frug,WinterRise,That assist by Ronaldo!
dx7fsju,Zlatan4Ever,Football is weird sometimes.
dx7ft3s,roamingthought,Does it matter what Buffon said or was the aggressive screaming enough?
dx7fu0m,u-n-i-t-y,there was no substitute for watching this match live.
dx7fvpf,ta84351,shame buffon lost his head. he could've been the hero
dx7fw4q,tahp_master,Poor Buffon
dx7fwrd,Tian_04_,Last game for Buffon and he gets send off the pitch ;(
dx7fy6z,ideasrbproof,Actually think it was Matuidi who pushed the ref and not Buffon. The penalty isn't as clear as it looked but probably is a penalty.
dx7fyce,waynerooney501,I missed the game.... why was Buffon sent off? It looked like a penalty but not sure why buffon got sent off for this?
dx7g75d,hinkqvist,Pushed the ref in rage
dx7fyoa,Mojojojo4eva,Shitty way for the game to end but it was the right call.

dx7hbhn,CarlosFer2201,I'm just sad for Gigi. Ideally (for a Madrid fan) Juve should have been eliminated without controversy and then he would have been applauded out of the stadium
dx7hd1c,poopiepuppy,At least the penalty was not scored on Buffon.
dx7n5tk,KalidouTorreira,"It is a penalty but goddamn, it is a [""the jews did this""](https://i.imgur.com/aiEJH.gif)."
dx7o11b,mods_are_soyboys,why is it even +7 mins what happened
dx7o6w5,SahdBoi,Pentalty was given way ahead. Buffon got red card and Juve made a sub. Also Juve players tried to talk shit to Ronaldo. So yeah.....
dx7p36d,Amusebeard,"Something nobody is saying, protesting is a yellow card by rulebook, isn't it?"
dx7q5dt,sarcastictrey,Rule book? Pfft. Rules don't matter when Ronaldo is on the pitch. I see where you got confused thinking that the refs are impartial during competition. Are you new here? /s

dx7yc86,tnzk01,He pushed Oliver aggressively.

dx83s22,hogtown91,SIIIIIIII
dx89m87,Daimyon,As someone who didn't catch the game that seems like a lot of overtime minutes.Was it legit to have +7 mins or maybe uefa shenanigans?
dx89yn9,Ask_Asensio,There was only 3 minutes of extra time. Penalty was called at 92:30 then the Juve players proceeded to compain for 5 minutes.
dx8c5s0,shsu5687,Why was zidane so calm when the team scored?
dx8d6yf,shsu5687,Maybe he doesn't think the team is playing well actually.
dx8cvtb,pukelennock,"Jesus Christ, what a wonderful penalty!"
dx8gdzc,Boris_CRO,"Guys, never seen a match. Was it a legit penalty or not ?"
dx8h5z0,antonyhayden,Shouldn't the penalty have been retaken for encroachment in the area? 🤔
dx905dy,ScrantonPaper,"Sorry, TOTAL soccer n00b here, but how does one goal vs 3 advance them through the series?"
dx91ilg,gemifra,"This is 2nd leg. In 1st leg, real madrid won 3-0 in away game. The aggregate was 4-3."
dx91j50,cl0wnfiesta66,"Real madrid had scored 3 goals in the first match, so they won 4-3"
dxb4usz,Matt-J-,Don't know any other team that flops more than real madrid and the referee actually bought it. What a joke.
dxb6jgu,ZeRoGr4vity07,"Man just image all the pressure that was on CR's shoulders at the penalty, just insane"
dx7f077,,[deleted]
dx7fr1w,,It's a two legged tie. Both teams were largely equal over the two legs. Don't see why this win isn't worthy of respect.
dx7g92j,kaneki_sasaki,Navas' mistake for Juves 3rd goal? In the end the team which went through is probably the deserving one
dx7gtea,DareiosX,I mean Juve still won the game. But Real deservedly won the aggregate.
dx81dte,ramaxin,They won thanks to bulshit penalty.Not first time happened that referee helps them.Hopefully they get kicked out at next stage cause they don't deserve to play in final.
dx82opg,laterport,Referee is an asshole.

dx7etoc,dohhhnut,"cmon man, i'm not a real fan and that was a pen. No two ways about it"
dx7euid,cbruce11,Bailed out in the 93rd minute (correct call tho). Definitely a choke job.
dx7em3p,TurkeyBakon,You choked and the ref gave you guys cpr
dx7ej4i,OSU31UM20,GOAT
dx7ghjf,Highburysqrrl,"He fell down way too easily - many of your say it was a push, but looked like a touch/feel. Not a penalty."
dx7gocm,lambomrclago,"Obvious penalty - easily a foul anywhere else on the field, if he doesnt foul him he taps it in. Anyone who thinks it isn't a penalty is frankly delusional."
dx7ed1e,ITsLoverBoy,But Uefalona amirite?
dx7f0ol,emrys5,It was the right call tho..
dx7f4vb,ITsLoverBoy,Idk man it didnt feel like one to me. The dude started falling down before there was even contact.
dx7h3qc,niner-nation,it's called going for the header.
dx7hiv9,ITsLoverBoy,Even then it felt very soft for a penalty.
dx7fdnb,Rodsoldier,"Considering it was the right call, yeah."
dx7g7ok,ITsLoverBoy,Fuck you and your facts. I'm irrationally mad.
dx7f463,Mandalf_the_Guy,09 against Chelsea is totally different from a clear pen and deserved red card. Much love for Buffon though sad to see it end like that.
dx7g5he,FOKvothe,"Going against the stream here, I think it's not a penalty. It looks like Vasquez is waiting for the contact, and falls at the minimal contact. I doubt it would have been called if it was an away leg against a lesser team. ."
dx7gnxy,Faizan24839,A clear shove in a goal scoring opportunity. Definite penalty. A soft one at best.
dx7hjhx,FOKvothe,"I don't think the shove is that clear.but angle I saw it from didn't show it that well, so I might be entirely wrong."

dx7fi42,assassinadam41,What are u talking about
dx7e7sg,Himel713,survived
dx8ep8f,YOLANDILUV,this decision from the referee makes professional football look bad. I'm neither a fan of Juventus nor Real Madrid but this is is just stealing an opportunity from the better team
dx9cel3,TomasBerdshit,"The referee is meant to make the correct decision, not favour the team that deserve the match. If that was the case barcelona would win every game due to the referee giving them decisions"
dxadonw,YOLANDILUV,"excatly. the decision he made was wrong because it was a dive. furthermore the referee is meant to guide a match with tact, not strictly obey the rules. > bayern munich would win every game fyp"
dxaf8q0,TomasBerdshit,"So you're saying that you're meant to make a decision based on the situation instead of making the same decision, no matter what the situation is"
dx7emsz,,[deleted]
dx7fknh,johnsom3,I thought he had an excellent game.
dx7fkg8,Mandalf_the_Guy,By calling a correct penalty?

dx7fnv8,labtecoza,> controversial
dx7ex72,Jewbacca1,"Watch the replay again, there's nothing controversial about it."
dx7f56y,Chareq,"It was a 100% clear foul, I really don't get the outrage"
dx7fgyq,Abdepipe,Hmmm. Almost feel like this has happened before... *mumbles something about Bayern game last year*
dx7get5,nocturn-e,"It shouldn't be controversial at all. Regardless how soft it was, it was still a foul, and a foul in the box is a penalty."
dx7en77,zaphodbx,cheap penalty
dx7fbjz,superdankleo16,Quite the opposite it probably cost Madrid a lot of money.
dx7f6xs,GeauxSuperBayern,Vazquez was begging for that pen soft cunt
dx7fbte,SturrCrazy,The travesty that is Michael Oliver.
dx7fshw,BasilandLavender,how dare he make the right call!!!
dx7wxea,SturrCrazy,"It's not a red card offense for Buffon to protest like that. Michael Oliver hands out red cards like nobody else, and this is another example of him getting it wrong. A ref in a professional game should be able to take criticism or opposition from a player without overreacting."
dx7flwm,Adili811416,ban Vasquez for that dive
dx7m3sa,NoorBall,Am I the only one who thinks that Benatia got a ball.
dx7mr7c,william405,"Should have been a pen given the state of today's game but ffs, just try playing to the whistle instead of playing for the whistle. An awkward side kick isn't gonna make you tumble over. I grew up watching this sport and idolizing the players. Now I'm legitimately more impressed with my own athleticism and sportsmanship, only thing that impresses me about these pussies is their technique, take that away and their just dainty little 40kg pussies with amazing cardio. Even if you think that there was no way he could have stood up (there was, he's just a pussie boi) you can't deny that every year more and more players dive, and go down easy, just because there is contact, then they roll around like they have absolutely no fucking shame. It straight embarrassing, not to mention a million other calls went the wrong way this round and acting like there is no need for a solution because you think this call is correct is just ignoring the issue."
dx7pec0,vihor,spot on!
dx7um3q,ortz3,"Can't blame Vazquez. He felt a nudge and went down like all players do. These types of penalties 50/50 whether their given or not. But given that is the 93rd fucking minute and about to go to extra time, if your gonna call a penalty you better fucking be sure that you are 1000% a penalty and its not soft, which in this case was a soft penalty which is why I'm pissed it was given"
dx7ykn4,william405,"Yeah I don't like that it was given for pretty much the same reason you said. I'm not blaming solely Vasquez, its just the game as a whole is hard to watch and get excited for like I use to. Its embarrassing to be cheering for a bunch of grown men who roll around on the ground like they died when they feel a tap. Faking it or not, its just embarrassing, laughable, and hard to watch.My whole life, and I'm sure its the same for the rest of the fans here, I had to hear ""soccer is for pussies"", ""soccer players are babies"" and for the most part they were dead wrong and maybe just cherry picking a couple instances of blatant dives in obscure leagues. But now, they're right, the people saying that are right, I have no comeback for them, I just say ""yeah but I got emotionally invested when I was younger, before it was like this""."
dx7nq3t,hereslemon,what a fucking anticlimactic ending to an otherwise great game. would have preferred it going onto ET at least but fair dos to real
dx7od6g,SahdBoi,Anticlimactic? Literally the most insane ending if you were passive supporter.
dx7rbth,hereslemon,definitely had a deflating ending to a neutral viewer.
dx86uoh,AnirD,If you needed more proof that UEFA is crooked
dx7e8sh,DoubleALight,BULLSHIT
dx7elpz,Bulgerius,"They were just dying to give a penalty, weren't they? Soft foul. Outside of the box, call the foul, in the box it's such a soft penalty that wins a match."
dx7exeb,League0fGaming,"If it's a foul, it's a foul. Where it occurs shouldn't have any bearing on the decision. If it happened anywhere else there'd be no controversy."
dx7f1je,Bulgerius,"Let's be realistic though, it always does. Other refs all around the world will let shit slide in the box they'd whistle for in an instant for one outside of box. When you consider the implications you better be damn sure. The point of view showed the ref had a poor shot of the foul and the benefit of the doubt belongs to the defender. This game was immense, it deserved better."
dx7gb5n,DareiosX,"It was a clear foul. If the ref wasn't sure, he rightfully trusted his instincts."
dx7feie,League0fGaming,"I know it happens all the time. The same happens for second yellows, where refs seem reluctant to book a player for a foul that they'd have no hesitation doing so normally. I would prefer if the bigger implication was ignored more often, to be honest. A foul is a foul.To me, the challenge is a definite foul. I won't comment on the ref's view, but given that I think it was a foul, I can't complain that it was given.Fuck Real anyway though. Juve deserved at least to go to ET."
dx7fsxf,Bulgerius,"Too many games have been ruined in the past because of harsh cards and calls. That's the reason they changed the rule from penalty and a red, to just a yellow if you get the penalty. It was a foul, but a very soft one when you consider it won RM the game."
dx7hsgq,Rockyrock1221,EhhhhIf the situation was exactly the same but it was Juve instead of Real I bet the red swallows his whistle there.I think it was a pen but to call it in that scenario is a bad decision imo.It's 3-3 after 180 minutes. Let the boys decide the game in OT. Not a 50/50 call that wouldn't be an outrage if it wasn't given
dx7fq7y,Rodsoldier,Little tip: don't count on the ref not calling an obvious penal just because you want him to fix the game to make it interesting.
dx7g85c,Bulgerius,"Hard to take a Portuguese fan serious on this one, of course you think it was a penalty. We got screwed hard last year by a last second penalty that was soft as hell versus Juve, so if I wanted a narrative it would to enjoy this for sweet sweet revenge."
dx7gekb,Rodsoldier,I'm Brazilian though.
dx7i3k5,Bulgerius,My mistake.
dx7i6lf,Rodsoldier,"Fun fact(i just want to relive the good times really), my team is 1-1 against Milan. Cheers."
dx7fvvv,0aniket0,Soft? Benetia came flying from behind with legs high! Clear pen
dx7g4p8,Bulgerius,Maybe if you're a little weakling. Those are the sort of fouls that make footballers look like babies. Friendly reminder the women hit 10X harder.
dx7gavr,0aniket0,"Doesn't matter if you're a women/strong/weak/Ronaldo/Messi, if there's a tackle from back with legs high making contact with player before the ball then it's a penalty every fuckin day of the week"
dx7i77j,Bulgerius,"If you want the sport to devolve into who is the best actor even further, then sure. vasquez had a chance to stay on his feet and shoot but he fell the second he was touched. Foul, yes. But he didn't even attempt to stay up. I don't fault him though. Just this season Hakan stayed up versus Arsenal in a clear foul and he was punished for not diving."
dx7fd1h,Thekantona,Not surprised its a Premier League ref who makes such a shit call. Shit refereeing for years now in England.. Hope none of them go to the World Cup.
dx7fy5z,carrick1363,They are not going so that is good
dx8ymy5,Thekantona,Even Fifa think they are shit then. But hey downvoted lol
dx7fd7r,CanInArk,"This call will only go to the Real Madrid's, Barcelona's of the world.NO way any other team gets that call. UEFA can't have both Barceloverrated and Real out at this phase.Extremely soft penalty. Real Madrid and their POS glory hunting fans can go to hell. What an embarrassment for the sport today."
dx7fecq,ihaverocketlegs,Dude that's a penalty.
dx7ibmy,CanInArk,"> e that's a penalty.It's a penalty that only the corrupt teams like Barca, Real will get.No other team gets that call in the 95th minute."
dx7hzjb,Rockyrock1221,Agree 100% It was a pen by rule I agree but Juve wouldn't have gotten that call if the position was reversed
dx7sw50,chak100,"And if my grand mother had wheels she would be a bicycle. You are with whataboutism just to shit in Madrid. It was pen, weather soft or hard (don't even know what the fuck is that, a foul is a foul)"
dx7ysbo,Rockyrock1221,If it was given against your team you would've complained and called it soft. Guarantee
dx7zgl0,chak100,"No, because it was a pen. I would be coursing the player who did the play"
dx7e9jf,vxid_,"Fuck off, fuck this."
dx7e9ss,CityOdyssey2001,Penaldo
dx7eabx,AndyFNG,sad but fair
dx7eciz,CharlottesWebster,That was a really borderline call. Can see arguments for both sides. Hell of a pen too.
dx7eg2u,BubleSchwinslow,Shirtless Ronaldo looking like a demigod after that goal
dx7enat,noise256,We will avenge you Juve. :)
dx7enea,GoonerMS101,"I don't know how anyone can say that wasn't a penalty. Absolutely woeful from Benatia to let Vasquez get in front of him. He made two mistakes which swayed Oliver to call the penalty. Firstly, he used his arms to get a hold of Vasquez and secondly he tried to clear the ball from behind without having a clear view of it (and didn't really successfully manage to connect with the ball)."
dx7ephx,Ssj4Gogeta17,English referees are a disgrace to the game
dx7ev58,afc_foreman,"The player was 100% looking for a penalty, he stopped running towards the ball and didn't even try and head it. Pathetic"
dx7eybx,RyoCaliente,Because he wasn't trying to head it. He obviously wanted it on the ground to shoot it in.
dx7fahu,afc_foreman,"Well his situational awareness is shit then, I'm not saying there wasn't contact but it looked like he was looking for it"
dx7ew5z,spiig,No doubt in my mind that's a penalty. Shame it had to end that way but definitely the right call(s).
dx7f199,Oktavien,I don't really care for either of these teams but can anyone explain to me why this is a penalty? It looks to me like the Madrid player falls down very easy while the Juve player actually got the ball and really didn't impede RM play. Poor call from the ref imo.
dx7f2th,bosnian_red,"Embarrassing in here... Stonewall penalty, jumped in his back, little push in the back, swung his leg around Vazquez's body and didn't even touch the ball. Didn't have much of a choice though since the mistake was leaving him wide open in the first place and he would've scored anyway. Just because we all didn't want it to happen, doesn't mean it wasn't blatant.Also Buffon. Footballing legend, but you can't react like that. Red all day."
dx7favx,jmfbot,"Good to see someone talking sense, some of the opinions flying around here are absurd."
dx7fyq7,bosnian_red,"Ridiculous, everyone is emotion driven and lose all reason. It's a foul anywhere on the pitch, any minute of the game. And the whole argument about ""giving a penalty in the 93rd minute kills the story""... The story was that Real Madrid were shit for 90 minutes but created a moment of quality at the end and created a clear goalscoring opportunity in the dying seconds, Vazquez from a few yards out ready to tap it in. The only thing Juve could do was foul him and hope the ref fucks up (which he didn't) or Ronaldo missed the pen (which he didn't). A story of almost there, but not quite good enough. Not a robbery at all. Being robbed is when an incorrect call kills you after you had the win. Not even yesterday where City benefitted for the first goal but then got one legitimate goal disallowed. On the balance, still 1-0, and even if 2, still a lot to do."
dx7f7fw,Tav19,Honestly I would've given both the penalty and the red as well. The pen was the right call and you can't get up into the refs grill screaming and pushing him like that. Doesn't matter if its Buffon or Jesus Christ himself imo
dx7fa8r,superdankleo16,I really don't think that's a penalty he feels him from behind and starts falling trying to get the penalty. I know it looks like it but playing you know that's minimal contact. I'm really furious it ended like that that's a call you can make at midfield during the game but with 30 seconds left tie game for the champions you should never call such a weak foul.
dx7fej7,slidinggoal,It's funny. If that was Ronaldo everyone would say it's a dive.
dx7fau0,teasizzle,"Gutted for Juve and for Buffon.Both decisions were correct. I'm an advocate of players being punished for dissent, etc. It's sad, but it's just."
dx7fcys,MoSalad,I still don't know if that was a penalty or not. But I can guarantee I'd have bottled it rather than have Buffon screaming in my face.
dx7fgrr,FuckingWrongDumbass,Thank christ youre not a ref then
dx7fkm4,MoSalad,Yep that's the point
dx7feu1,hks2293,I swear if cristiano missed this one I'd have a heart attack for sure. My heart was beating so fast.
dx7k0wb,sportsfan161,Looks a clear pen to me
dx7l5z8,fancifulmagpie,Man maybe that was a peno but that was weak as fuuuuuck. Absolutely zero that pressure from benatia knocks down vasquez without him looking for that penalty. Sucks to see that at the final minute. English reffos heyyyy
dx7nyqo,kieron296,"Credit where credit is due; All that pressure on Ronaldo and there was no doubt he was smashing it top bins. Oliver got the call right and even tho I was rooting for a comeback for the sake of more quality football, It was the correct call. Comebacks like that are once in a lifetime unless its the UCL QF 2018😝."
dx7ot8w,Marem-Bzh,"Well yes, that's a clear pen.I reallt happy that we got our 3-0 revenge. Let's just say we lost to penalty shoutouts"
dx86roe,jlaweber,"In Libertadores it wouldn't be called, and if it was, the crowd would riot and murder the referee."
dx8brnj,En_Panda,"Yea, this match was not played in a third world country."
dx87d1x,GoGoGo_PowerRanger94,"His mask slipped and Buffon showed his true colours there with his attack on the ref, not such a nice guy after all eh Gigi. All that effort, shameless near constant self-promotion and PR to come across well in front of the cameras etc is all a sham, the man thinks he's above the laws of the game. Good riddance Gigi you clown."
dx8j74v,EmanueleZip,what a robbery
dx8sem1,aivind,"I truly cannot believe he was able to score that penalty the way he did it. The pressure must have been through the roof. The Juventus team were messing with him and tried to get in his head. I would have had a mental breakdown if I had to take that penalty, and he just bangs it into the wrong side top corner like it's nothing. The expectations on this guy are fucking unreal, and yet he still somehow always exceeds them. His mental strength and his physique (at the age of 33!!) is inhuman. He's just unreal, an absolute alien and a better player than anything anyone could ever ask for. The day this man hangs up his boots will be my sadest moment of football, but until then I'm just gonna enjoy every single moment of it.¡GRACIAS CRISTIANO!"
dx8znho,dj1200techniques,OK now say it without ronaldo's cock in your mouth.
dx8zr0q,aivind,You seem nice.
dx9c9uj,TomasBerdshit,"Cmon it's time to throw the bucket of tears down the sink, we'll see you in the semis....Oh wait......"
dx7mhem,,[deleted]
dx7mod5,spacecreated1234,so you can't call a real foul because it's in the 90th minutes? i want what you're smoking dude
dx7e98q,tatxc,Bullshit
dx7iwow,Marco-the-Pineapple,"May be an unpopular opinion, but this was not a penalty at all. I dont care who wins the CL, so my impartial opinion is that Madrid didn't deserve to advance off a play like that. Now, playing like they did in leg 1 yes. But it sucks that part of the sport is dealing with bad calls that determine so much. As a side note, I saw a funny thing mentioning how a call like this in the copa libertadores would lead to WW3 haha."
dx7jca4,NinjaKoala,"I don't care about the remaining teams, but you can't push another player out of the way to kick the ball. It's a foul."
dx7kuaz,Marco-the-Pineapple,"I have watched it over and over, and I see the push you're talking about and can see how someone could argue it's a penalty. But I still don't think it was. There was a small push but it wasn't as serious as it was made out to be, but as an intelligent attacker he went down and appealed to the doubt of the situation. Oh well, Madrid are the better team I just feel like today Juve deserves to advance more than RM. if this were a boca game- forget it. I would have to go through therapy after a call like that."
dx7lbkv,Syctris,A small push? They guy pretty much jumped on his back and wrapped his leg all the way around him...
dx7lg25,Marco-the-Pineapple,I guess we just disagree. It was the last few seconds of play and regardless of what happened or who was there he was going to fall and reclaim a penalty.
dx7mno0,dude_whatever_,"2 hand push, swinging the leg, no contact with the ball, and it is not a penalty? Maybe you are not meant to watch this sport at all."
dx7mulm,Marco-the-Pineapple,Okay? Maybe you are not meant to have a discussion about this sport at all.
dx7owdn,dude_whatever_,"Maybe as an argentinian, 2 devastating results in 24 hours made you bitter. I am sure you know this is a penalty, but you wish it was not. Because messi is out, you wish HE was out too, but a last minute mistake by benatia made you go full BUFFON. Tomorrow is a new day, and I am sure you will come to your senses with the joy of a new day. But it will not change the fact that Ronaldo has once again carried his team to the semis, and probably the 3rd consecutive CL title."
dx7pb9a,Marco-the-Pineapple,"You might be right if I cared that much about the UCL or the Spanish clásico. In fact I am going for Bayern, a team made of up players that broke my heart in the last World Cup final. I have loved Ronaldo since the Joga Bonito commercials. I just don't like it when players exaggerate physical contact to manipulate refs. I am open to the possibility of changing my mind but my tomorrow I won't even care. I'm all about the libertadores amigo."
dx7lv4s,Syctris,"I mean if the guy doesn't tackle him, he scores, easily."
dx7m3r3,Marco-the-Pineapple,"The world will never know. I admire the call for what it is, it at least wasn't clearly not a penalty. I definitely wouldn't have called it though."
dx7mqz2,hennyV,"The push is one thing, but are you missing the part where he kicks Vasquez on the side of the chest? lol, we can argue if it would be called on madrid sure but its a clear foul nonetheless."
dx7ft5e,,[deleted]
dx7g123,MarquisJames,Lol yes bc Suarez is never rewarded for his egregious dives. /s
dx7gct2,,[deleted]
dx7h1ix,lambomrclago,"You can't do anything to lose your reputation, especially a reputation earned for being a biting cunt on more than one occasion. Frankly Suarez deserves any bias a ref would give him, he is a notorious asshole."
dx7gz19,lambomrclago,Maybe they awarded it because Vazquez hasn't bitten anyone?
dx7fzvs,onedestiny,Why the fuck would he dive with an open net in front of him? Clear push in the replay
dx7rbc7,rule34exists,KEEP ON CRYING
dx7ial1,ComicalAli,Ronaldo dived all match (at least 3 times on my count) yet didn't get booked. Somehow the cunt ref deems THAT challenge worthy of a peno.

dx7ej5u,FuzzyStorm,"Thats a pen every day, don't understand the ref hate around here."
dx7el1f,vacuumpacked,Shows up when it matters most.
dx7eltc,Cdux,Holy Shit.... I think i aged twenty years.
dx7enmt,IzkaGruba,"IT WAS A PENALTY, and everyone saying otherwise just wanted Real to lose."
dx7epqw,etsuited,Juventus have gotten awarded joke penalties in the competition before so it's rich of them to claim this was not a penalty when it clearly was
dx7eura,theglasscase,"Don't be so fucking stupid, do you really think Juventus players should have just said 'Yeah, good job referee, we've had soft penalties before so fair play!' Fuck off."
dx7exu5,etsuited,"No. But they shouldn't have shoved the ref. Methinks they doth protest too much. Clear penalty, what's to argue about?"
dx7f6ho,theglasscase,You've got to be fucking joking. Do you really think any set of players for any team would have just accepted that decision in the last minute of a game they're winning 3-0 with the tie at 3-3? This is fucking nonsense.
dx7fdr3,etsuited,"They should have taken it with a bit of respect for the decision, yes. That's how most teams do it, you don't touch the ref. It's not something you should ever do in any game. That's not a hard thing to teach players. It was disgraceful carry on, I can't stand the culture of surrounding officials at the best of times, but this was shockingly bad."
dx7eqg8,ugatorf,"I am normally a Ronaldo apologist, and I love to cheer for the ""villian"", but fuck off with that celebration. He might as well as spit on Buffon on his way out too. Probably the only time I wished Ronaldo would have showed some class. Regardless, hell of a penalty take!Edit: And before the downvotes come - absolutely, 100% a foul, but I disagree with the red. I feel for Buffon, and I kinda hoped Ronaldo would show a little bit of sympathy to someone he's publicly claimed to respect."
dx7eqro,Bigballerbooks,Massive Respect to Juventus. The best don't always get trophies.
dx7eqsh,Woody424,Having 2 keepers in net wouldn't have saved that one. What a shot under so much pressure.
dx7eqt5,udiniad,Plot armour saved us again
dx7esqo,DEUK_96,I feel for Juventus but that was the right call
dx7eucv,yammington,"Buffon monged out there, let his teammates down."
dx7euoy,xscientist,"This all falls on Benatia, should have trusted Gigi to make the save."
dx7ev14,DBxLazyscranton,Soft penalty but Buffon has to restrain himself at that point in the game. Getting yourself sent off is the last thing you want to do in that situation.
dx7fcpp,W0666007,"Seriously. They lose their keeper for the shot, and then if a miracle happens and Real misses, they're a man down for extra time."
dx7ev7d,jamesc90,Lmao Buffon
dx7evdy,MrSteglas,"Totally right call, this is football not Les Misérables."
dx7ewbh,Impatrickk,"Fucking robbery. Every year, these things never change"
dx7ewor,BenzamineFranklin,"Right call, valid result, but wtf man. Sad ending."
dx7exev,ibnfazari,The sad thing is ronaldo will win te ballon dor pretty much for this shocking bit of refereeing
dx7exz1,aventedor,"sure they lost, but if anyone on Real says they are the better team they have lost my respect entirely."
dx7ez7b,onthatgas,"It is a pretty shitty way to end a game, but it was a clear pen. And not only was it a clear pen, it would have been a for-sure goal without it. It's not as bad as if it was a minor call on the edge of the 18 yard box or something. Disappointing ending but can't fault ref or RM."
dx7ezlt,Trailer_Park_Jihad,Unbelievable the amount of people here saying this isn't a pen.If this exact foul happened to a Juve player in the Madrid box there would be no problem with the call.
dx7f2b8,MrKearns,"100% a penalty, 0% referee's fault, 100% the fault of the idiot defender. Today is the day /r/soccer exposed its collective brain rot."
dx7f2yt,jtweezy,"I mean, I guess that was a legit penalty, but that's a bad job by the ref to show Buffon the red card. I get Buffon was a bit over the top and made contact, but that's literally the last play he was going to make in a decorated career. Anything less than a thrown punch and the ref should have swallowed the whistle and allowed Buffon to be in goal for that penalty. I think everyone would have understood and been okay with him staying on the pitch.Heartbreaker for Juve though. They fought hard and I was hoping for extra time, but it just didn't work out that way. Perfect penalty by Ronaldo."
dx7ffbr,Hollandrock,"Perhaps you didn't think about it fully, but 'last action ever' assumes the penalty is scored, and to change a decision based on some sentimental notion like that towards a certain player would be ridiculous"
dx7f8dn,jmfbot,"Ridiculous! The red is clear as day. Well done for the referee for not allowing himself to be intimidated by reputation. Matches are governed by rules, not sentiment. Buffon let himself down."
dx7fapp,jtweezy,"I suppose. No dog in the fight here, but I just hate seeing Buffon being sent off like that. I'm sure in hindsight the ref was right to do it though."
dx7f4ng,frolicbeast,"Stupid ending to a great game. Say whatever you want about the penalty call, but I highly doubt that would be a penalty with any other referee or situation. His hands weren't on the man, they've been going down all game with light contact. Not to mention ejecting Buffon over whatever he must've said to the referee. Unreal."
dx7f5ie,radiokontroll,This will be a civil and nice discussion.
dx7f5rn,king_of_blig,I heard Oliver was seen running off the pitch laughing maniacally and muttering the word ‘brexit' repeatedly.
dx7f6e9,Petranul,I'm so angry and I'm not even a juve fun. What a disgrace. Complete bullshit.
dx7f76u,sjokoladenam,"Click the link and pause at 21sec, you can see he is starting to simulate the fall before he is barely hit with the left foot."
dx7f95g,perkel666,Juventus was the best and the worst team in this match at the same fucking time lol.
dx7fi90,xx_reked_xx,And people still think Messi is better lmao
dx7fiej,Mike_ITA,Nice try guys 😉
dx7fn0t,Platgamer187,The weight of the name Real Madrid was heavier than the refs balls.
dx7fn8q,Unto-The-Breach,"Vazquez goes down soft, but you cant make that kind of contact in the box. Foolish from Benatia to put his weight on him."
dx7g2qo,good_fellla,LV is a small guy. Benita pushed him and kneed him on the way down. Pretty big mistake to make at this stage. I was nervous as duck sitting on a couch I can't imagine what goes through these guys heads there on the pitch with so much at stake
dx7q2y1,Unto-The-Breach,"Yup was thinking the same after seeing the reply. LV is tiny compared to Benatia, something which the refs usually take into account"

dx7fuyz,Jaythe4th,Buuuulshit!!
dx7h4xn,yub_1,Why did he get a red card?
dx7jd24,sofian_kluft,Of course Real scores with a last minute penalty...
dx7ltkr,abdullah10,Ronaldo does not get flak for diving; he is 33 years old.
dx7ouk8,hopelessromantic7,Would never be called the other way.
dx7pnnh,0fiuco,he had immense balls to kick it like that under all that pressure. The guy is a robot
dx7vhp0,Yaya_Toyne37,Fuck me the guy's an absolute machine.
dx87yqj,GoGoGo_PowerRanger94,"Buffon's reaction was very hypocritical and rich coming from him. I mean he would of known all about contentious penalty decisions made very deep into extra time, made in the knock out phase of a major tournament... Because he played in the Round of 16 match featuring Australia vs Italy 2006 WC in Germany.In that match a dive by Grosso in the 95th minute(a dive that would've scored a perfect 10) and it resulted in a penalty. Totti scores to make it 1:0 to Italy with the last kick of the match & Italy of course went on to lift the World Cup(essentially by cheating) etc.. Only this time Buffon he's on the receiving end(and he has a problem with it all of a sudden :/)....ending a career that will be mostly discussed by the way it finished. Oh Gigi, karma just bit your arse!. What goes around, comes around."
dx882yj,NoGod4MeInNYC,"I didn't watch the game, can anyone tell me how the extra time was at 7 minutes lol. I can just imagine the agony of a juve fan during those 4 extra minutes. I assume the penalty took 3 min to sort out?"
dx88b6e,falkous,"Because the penalty got given at 2.30 into 3 minutes of extra time, then juve took another 5 minutes aggressively gesticulating at the referee before it could be taken."
dx89dl5,elit69,added time is 7???
dx8ahul,halfelven23,juventus players are protesting and that takes a lot of time
dx89lgd,amphibios,I would feel bad for Buffon if he didn't act like a kid in those last seconds. You would expect for someone with that experience to be more mature.
dx8jk6n,gamechanger1234786,One of the best penalties under pressure. Man is G.O.A.T
dx92pzp,tapk69,Its a very hard penalty to call. Usually this kind of contact happens a lot.

Vazquez isn't even aware that Benatia is behind him.https://i.imgur.com/yemyNTS.jpgWhere is the dive?

dx84qym,get_unoffended,50/50 call. Easily could have been not given. Weak weak shout.
dx7zxkl,TheStryfe,Yes
dx8fukx,divinity_hs,ofc it's not. There are plenty of ppl that think that's not a pen. How do you even can write yes lol. So biased.
dx8mdnt,TheStryfe,It's not biased because no one with eyes questions that it's a pen
dx8o9xn,divinity_hs,ye ye repeat that to yourself
dx8piyw,TheStryfe,Do you not like facts?
dx8zcpw,divinity_hs,fact is 100% true thing. Reddit is shit in suggesting that there's other opinions there. Hint. Try debates. Maybe it'll help you.
dx90n0k,TheStryfe,Except it's facts that this is a pen
dx929gw,divinity_hs,how that's is a fact? fact is 2+2=4.
dx93wja,TheStryfe,And if you have functioning eyes you could see it was a clear pen

dx7e8q1,not_Kyle_Katarn,juventus robbed
dx7el8o,longboardingerrday,Not really. They conceded 3 in the first leg and put themselves at a serious disadvantage.

dx7edyu,iTs_CursxR,"I'm sorry but you guys did not deserve to win that way. If it went to extra time and you guys scored, fine. But this is a load of horseshit"
dx7efzx,Mister_Sassafrazz,Hey man I agree. I'm happy we went through but it wasn't a good call. Not from what I saw.
dx7g5dt,Manlad,"Stop fucking Karmawhoring""Look at me, I'm a REAL MADRID FAN and yet I'm disagree with a call that benefits Real Madrid. Oh I'm such a classy fan. Respect.""We all know it was a penalty you prat. Stop trying to get internet points by being controversial against your own team."
dx7go4j,Mister_Sassafrazz,You can be critical of how you go through my dude. Not everyone has to be a rabid fanboi.
dx7gqwh,Manlad,"Yeah but, assuming you watch football, you know that it was clearly a pen. You look like a bellend."
dx7htc4,Mister_Sassafrazz,"Mate it was a soft pen at most. It would've been controversial if he didn't award just as it's controversial that he did. Get off your high horse with your ""assuming you watch football"" bullshit. We have seen harsher shit not get called and we've seen stupider stuff get called. It's football, it happens. Doesn't mean we can't be critical of it."
dx7es21,Valencia4eva,Ref steals the show once again. Fuck everything
dx7foji,chemcrimp,Pen all day m8
dx7gtig,Valencia4eva,I agree
dx7feo6,AngryWelshSheep,What's he supposed to do? Make the wrong decision by doing nothing? Doubt you'd say this if it were Valencia instead of Real.
dx7gc65,Valencia4eva,"It was a penalty yes, but how the fuck does Buffon get a red?? These refs are blind with power sometimes. At least give Buffon a chance to save his team in the last play of the game. I don't care for Real, but to win in this manner after a hard fought 90 minutes is infuriating. But this is football, so I will calm down now."
dx7gx4x,AngryWelshSheep,"You can't touch a ref. He lost his rag, he saw red. Footballers and managers need more respect shown towards refs. Correctly disciplining players and managers who refuse to respect the referee is a start.I don't like it anymore than you do. But Oliver had to take action otherwise refs everywhere get walked over. And by setting an example by sending off one of the most legendary goalkeeper of all time will send a big fucking message to players that they need to understand the refs authority."
dx7i700,Valencia4eva,"Point noted, but what is the old saying? Soccer is a gentleman's game played by thugs? I don't ever see a football ref gaining the respect shown to rugby referees. With the introduction of VAR, it will only undermine the ref's decisions further. If you want to see football players respecting the ref, it should be shown through consistent refereeing and standards across the entire refereeing body. But that calls into question the standards for each country, as styles and physicality vary greatly. Maybe Champions league should have their own referees that follow their own strict set of standards. Ok, I'm going into a hole, but you get my drift.Sad ending to a good game, but at least I have my health."
dx7fz8t,kilaude,"How does he steal the show? It's a penalty. It's also a clear red card for Buffon, as much as I like the man."
dx7gm73,Valencia4eva,"He steals the show by flashing a red card to Buffon before the deciding play of the game. It was a clear penalty, but to do something that dramatic screams grandstanding to the home stadium. If it were a yellow and Real still scored, I'm sure no one would be shocked, but this is grandstanding. This is egoism."
dx7fm26,RagingSam,"The second Vasquez felt Mahdi's hand on his back he went for the fall, unfair really..Gutted for Buffon too..Thank god no English refs in the WC..."

dx7edaw,FlyingBlueWhale,"Penaldo, divaldo^^^/s"
dx877kg,IgnoreMyName,Am I missing something? Juventus has 3 points correct? And Ronaldo's team has 1? So why does everyone say Juventus lost/out of the Champions League?
dx881en,iChopPryde,"This was game 2, I believe the first game Real Madrid won 3-0 so Juventus was winning 3-0 which made it a tie. Ronaldo scored making it 3-1 so total score is 4-3 and Madrid goes to the next round as it's a best of 2 matches."

dx7idzl,TottenhamDan,This should be the top comment
dx7f24x,goregego,you know it was a corrcet call but you don't want it to be
dx7v80a,marko911,"not a correct call at all, in that context of the game with that amount of contact to whistle for penalty...thats unheard of...vasquez was making a meal of the initial contact too he does it constantly in la liga gimme a fucking break i dont want it to be, if that was the case only barca fans would be outraged but look at the reactions worldwide"
dx7gj7v,nocturn-e,You can't give a clear penalty?
dx7f89j,PM_Me_Unpierced_Ears,Why not? Give reasons why you can't give the most obvious penalty ever?

dx7fztm,niner-nation,why exactly ?
dx7eq0w,Philostotle,Ronaldo should have been sent off in the first half for his hatrick of dives
dx7syn5,chak100,I agree with you on that. Really pissed with that attitude
dx7ezjd,Danjiks88,"You just do not decide a game like this singlehandedly. Was it a Pen. Dunno, depends on the ref to be honest. It was rather soft. Was it a pen in this situation. Hell no. That was an absolute joke. Refs are not there to hand teams wins."
dx7f3rr,FlawedGenius7,What difference does it make what situation the penalty call occurs in?
dx7fkot,Danjiks88,"Oh c'mon. Don't tell me same Penalty call can be made in the 1st minute or 90th. If they take a player down by sliding tackle all clear yes of course. But a soft call like this..... Please. Especially in a game like this. You just don't do that. I'm not saying as to whether it was a penalty or not, but unless it's like 100% obvious you don't do that in the 93rd minute. Let the teams play and decide who's better not take matters into your own hands"
dx7tcz0,chak100,"A foul is a foul, doesn't matter the minute. Perhaps you can ame Benatia for a Poot decision"

dx7lqgg,dude_whatever_,"That my friend, is a clear penalty."
dx7na0w,DuckThor,"Watch the original replay, not all the others. That, my anonymous internet nobody, is a hard decision to make when the player throws himself to the ground on the 93rd minute."
dx7o2py,dude_whatever_,"Why and how would vasquez throw himself to the ground? 1 on 1 with the keeper, chance to be the hero, he can not and does not see benatia coming, and is pushed to the ground plus a kick swung at him. You gotta be kidding. It is a clear, stonewall penalty."
dx7q4cs,DuckThor,I just read your comment history. You are a sad fanboy. Too bad.
dx7q8di,dude_whatever_,"If I was a fanboy, believe me I would not be sad.Stick with the context, rather than reading history.This is a penalty regardless of my or any one else's comment history.Cheers soccer enthusiast"

dx83i8t,Krampus1313,"of course real gets lucky in the 7th min of 3 min stoppage time, of course its penaldo...So sick of Madrid and Ronaldo"
dx8d3hy,Siralosmdk,"Penalty was called on 92:30, don't cry and just defeat us (or try) on the semifinals/finals"
dx8fpdv,Krampus1313,"don't worry, you're not as strong as you think you are. Hopefully you guys get Liverpool and I would love to see them trash you. Unfortunately with our injuries I don't think we have enough for you."
dx987bt,blahblahcomewatchTV,Which key players are injured?
dx9unot,Krampus1313,"Coman and I don't know, the best Fucking goalie in the world"
dx9uuk6,blahblahcomewatchTV,Oh I thought there was a recent injury. Coman is gonna be missed. But you guys reached the semis without Neuer. And tbf the best goalie in the world conceded 5 goals last year from Ronaldo. I don't think Ulreich would do a lot worse :)
dx89rnz,Divinebum,Love you too bby.
dx84wzw,BrianDawkins,Please beat them
dx7el0h,Kloncs,May he never call a game again.
dx7f8yj,sm0r3ss,what? the ref was fantastic this game.
dx7fp5i,fatb0,Kys
dx7fpd2,Shotten,"Yeah! Lets punish referees officiating extremely great in a High intense game, clear pen."
dx7fzzf,Kloncs,"Like I said elsewhere - if this is a clear penalty, then they have to start calling every single shirt pull too. It would be devastating for the game."
dx7fnoc,-Darth-Jar-Jar,Why? that was the correct call
dx7fsji,Kloncs,"If so, they have to start calling every shirt-pull that happens in the area. The contact is minimal."
dx7g3jt,-Darth-Jar-Jar,"Without the contact Lucas would have had a header from 2 meters, Benatia jumped on his back and it hit his chest"
dx7g2uw,HrtSmrt,"Hear, hear!"
dx7n59d,Dion14,"Man, i will never understand why people actually like Real Madrid. Literally all the douchebags play there. Ronaldo taking his shirt off while he was falling like a bitch all game. I mean the whole world wanted Juve to win except for Real fans and it has to be in this way... I will probably be downvoted a lot but man idc anymore"
dx7zssc,tnzk01,"You were the kid in school that watched the other guys take all the girls home, weren't you? Calling them douchebags and shit."
dx972u8,Dion14,Hhahaha made me laugh. but no i was in the middle group :D
dx8dmuj,Golden_Draco,Lmao you are pathetic
dx9749s,Dion14,go run on a pitch or something
dx7nsqn,SahdBoi,Its only game... why u have to be mad?
dx970c7,Dion14,"Not mad just really curious how you can support douchebags like Ramos, Ronaldo and marcelo"
dx97eik,SahdBoi,Ok Ramos maybe he can be a cunt sometimes but did you not see what Ronaldo did in the first leg? He was booed all damn game scores a sick goal and thanks the away fans. He is booed every damn game and abused every day and he's a cunt?And how can you call Marcelo a douchebag? He plays this game with all his heart. What he dived a couple of times who doesn't these days. I don't like the diving but it's something we have to live with. It's embarrassing for both the players and fansMy point is they are not douchebags ok thnx
dx7ewvf,SUCKMADIIIICK,"where in the fucking developed world is this a penalty when the fucking attacker is going down before the contact(which happens while he fucking cleares the ball) even happens? fucking scum, tonight football got tarnished once again ,fuck those greedy fucks not allowing VAR"
dx7fjiq,tablet1,That's a clear penalty everywhere
dx7fs29,SUCKMADIIIICK,"can you tell me why? hes clearing the ball and the attacker goes down before hes even touching him, do you have a way better angle?"
dx7eowq,LewsTherin177,"Penaldo 1 - 0 Barca/City/Juve.Suck it, losers."
dx7ff0t,festeziooo,What a childish comment lol.
dx7fsbb,LewsTherin177,"A lot of people on this sub have a history of:1. Not acknowledging Ronaldo as the undisputed 🐐, which he is,2. Calling him Penaldo,3. Being salty AF when we win, so this is dedicated to them."
dx7g0a1,festeziooo,"Not sure about ""undisputed GOAT"", pretty sure plenty of people would dispute that, even, dare I say it, outside of this sub. Most of the ""Penaldo"" comments I see are said as jokes after he scores a good goal. And if you can't understand why people are in general disappointed that another underdog loses in the last minute to a penalty (even if it was deserved), then you don't really know all that much about being a fan of a sport."
dx7gakb,LewsTherin177,"> Not sure about ""undisputed GOAT"", pretty sure plenty of people would dispute that, even, dare I say it, outside of this sub.A travesty if true.> Most of the ""Penaldo"" comments I see are said as jokes after he scores a good goal.I don't know, I've had long conversations with Barca fans who genuinely believe it.> And if you can't understand why people are in general disappointed that another underdog loses in the last minute to a penalty (even if it was deserved), then you don't really know all that much about being a fan of a sport.I'm a Madrileño, born and bred, so yes, I only care about Real."
dx7ggvd,festeziooo,"All of these things are entirely subjective to your specific opinions about your favorite team. You haven't made good arguments here. And based on your post history, you like to bait people that will have equally baseless opinions and getting into shouting matches with them."
dx7itlg,LewsTherin177,"Not trolling, tbh. And I don't ""like to bait people."" As I said, it's been a frustration how much stick Cristiano gets on here."
dx7kvec,festeziooo,I think this is manufactured stick. If you go to his goal from the first leg it's pretty much just a circle jerk for how crazy it was. Just my opinion though. Enjoy the semis.
dx84nph,get_unoffended,"I have no idea why this reddit's consensus is that is a clear-cut penalty. That is a weak penalty at best. Hands on him for a split-second, barely a shove. I could easily see it not given if it wasn't at home. Everyone here saying it's strong refereeing but really it was a 50/50 call and he went with the home crowd."
dx8bmgw,ElCaminoInTheWest,"Contact with hands and foot. Clearly enough contact to at least unbalance the striker. Didn't win the ball. Prevented a clear goalscoring opportunity. I can't see any way that's not a penalty.If that was your team, and the ref didn't give it, you'd be absolutely furious."
dx8a3ol,Ask_Asensio,[He doesn't even get the ball](https://twitter.com/Mundo_MadridCF/status/984236692180815872)
dx7f8de,JayNN,Classic referee helping Real Madrid - we're getting used to it by now.
dx7e8pe,ahmralas,That was not a fucking penalty
dx7edga,spudlifting,How is that not a penalty? lol
dx7ei6m,MarcusRashford97,Cause lucas started diving before bentia touched him.
dx7epju,spudlifting,Looked like he was bending down to head the ball. Didn't even know a player was behind him until he got shoved and leg wrapped around him.
dx7gs51,nocturn-e,What are you even watching? He clearly set his feet to either head or chest the ball then got slammed in the back.
dx7el8d,ahmralas,Exactly
dx7er4w,nietzsche_niche,"hes falling before contact. if he wants to fall on his own accord that's fine by me, but it isnt a penalty."
dx7eymg,spudlifting,No he isn't. https://i.imgur.com/vxh00xq.jpg
dx7f5xe,nietzsche_niche,"ah, the smoking gun. a single frame from an angle that doesnt show contact."
dx7fdkh,spudlifting,"You're right, in the next millisecond between the foul and this frame he clearly sensed a player was about to touch him and dived on the floor."
dx7flaf,nietzsche_niche,"millisecond? you think benatia gets around him and gets his leg up in a millisecond? And that, in that time, an athlete cant start moving downwards? its like your understanding of how the human body moves is based on QWOP."
dx7jqhq,spudlifting,"It was a fraction of a second. I don't know why you're so upset, I wanted Juve to win too but it was a clear penalty."
dx7kkbc,Flux_7,"He's upset because he supports Barca, his team and deity got shit on yesterday, so he was probably hoping the same thing would happen to RM."
dx7eu0b,FaudelCastro,He wanted to head the ball most probably
dx7en04,Julians_World,Never a penalty
dx7fhxr,Styphelus,Always a penalty! Right call. Too bad it happened right at the end.
dx7ea4t,iTs_CursxR,Fuck this bullshit. Real Madrid you cunts you guys don't deserve shit
dx7fgqm,zzt_zf_thz_blzz,"Let's just be honest, you just hate Zidane, don't you? ;)"
dx7gebo,iTs_CursxR,Yes :)
dx7ijo9,kriztean,"Michael Oliver ruined this match with a single decision. Yeah ok penalty. But red card just show his poor match management. Is the last bloody minute of the match and he gives a red card to the keeper, who was not involved in penalty call, because he touch him. Is bloody noneses. No wonder the are not UK referees in world cup.Fucking cunt"
dx7kh82,Suboptimal_Clearance,"Its a bit odd since Oliver declined to show a red card when Joe Hart headbutted him, but I think the ref got it right today."
dx7ipci,javk5pakfa,If Buffon cursed at the ref that is a RED CARD by the book.
dx8a2ih,kriztean,"The referee is asked by FIFA to have criteria. Many of the rules are about appreciation. Surprisingly, Howard Webb explains it clearly in (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e651_BJR9ds). The referee should manage the match, that's his job. His job is to navigate the nuance of the rule book. Buffon didn't put any other player in danger in the pitch (unlike Zidane in the WC for example). There was not bloody need of a fucking red card. Michael Oliver made a mistake and ruined a great match.edit: words"
dx7jisa,ThatBlackKid69,"No, that's the ref being a pussy, was scared Buffon was gonna bash his head in. I would have if I was Buffon."
dx7jz43,javk5pakfa,Read the fucking FIFA rule book before commenting any further.
dx7k9rx,ThatBlackKid69,There is a slight difference between Premier League and Champions League...
dx7l768,javk5pakfa,[Here.](http://www.thefa.com/football-rules-governance/lawsandrules/laws/football-11-11/law-12---fouls-and-misconduct) This is from the FA website. [Here.](https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_12_fouls_misconduct_en_47379.pdf) This is from FIFA's website. Both have cursing as a red card offense.
dx8q8g0,ThatBlackKid69,Aight cheers.
dx7kvsh,ThatBlackKid69,"Regardless, you don't know if he cursed him or not. Ref is just a little bitch."
dx7l92y,javk5pakfa,"But if Buffon cursed, then it was a correct decision! The ref would have no excuse to give Buffon a red if he didn't charge at him and yelling stuff."
dx8shkc,ThatBlackKid69,"It's still a very shit situation, for some reason I can't help but to believe Juve were cheated out of this game. But it doesn't matter now I'm over it."
dx7exh4,WakoJako,People on reddit really are blind wow.. HOW in the world can u call that a pen people.. The cheat even went down before the absolute minimal of touches.. football lost today. Bad bad game from Real only saved by cheating.. damn football sucks sometimes..
dx7tzw6,chak100,"Vazquez was preparing for a header and without knowledge of where benatia was. Benatia procedes to push home from the back, without an attempt to stop. It's really common to hate Madrid, but at least be reasonable"
dx7eacw,Hugh_of_Ilia,FUCKING PENALDO
dx7exeq,Trentinho,"Red deserved but not the penalty. Vasquez was always going down, might as well have been a feather in the breeze. I hope he never gets a big game again. He's notorious for bad calls like this, particularly soft penalties. Those of you calling him brave are simply wrong, he took the easy way out to hand Real the tie. Weak refereeing by Oliver."
dx7fao0,hardyblack,"Man, I fucking hate Real Madrid."

dx7fl8o,DavyH5,How is it rigged then?
dx7fjpj,Rossandliz,So many United fans are also Madrid fans. Their plastic would have melted of Madrid lost.
dx7edh6,johannesthiem,Neither a penalty nor a red card. Fuck off Madrid..
dx7ez8a,ikbeneenalt,TIL you can kick people in the ribs
dx7fgcu,johannesthiem,"Didn't see a kick, just a push. But even without a kick you are right that it's a penalty, just some emotions in the moment.I'll will still defend buffon though, that should not have been a straight red"
dx7fnzp,JustAdc,"He pushed the ref from behind, clear red. And was more than probably talking shit to him, tho that I cannot confirm. But the shoving alone warrants a red. Sad but true."
dx7fw49,johannesthiem,Not shown in the video that he pushed the ref. Maybe I missed it or I just didn't think it was that serious when I saw it. And if you say buffon deserved a red in that scene so did the whole juve squad
dx7fr2u,ikbeneenalt,Yeah I have no clue why he got a red. Though I have no idea what he said
dx7g021,johannesthiem,"True. If he really insulted the ref, the red is obviously deserved"
dx7gd3a,nocturn-e,A foul in the box isn't a penalty?Pushing the ref isn't a red?
dx7gjv8,johannesthiem,"As I said in another answer to my comment. I do see the foul, those were just some emotions in the momentAnd I did not see the pushing, maybe I missed it."
dx7xhwd,alltheseworldsryours,"Let's be clear; referees who live in the spirit of the game DO. NOT. MAKE. THAT. CALL.They just don't. And they don't rob all of us of Buffon vs CR7 FTW.What an absolute disgrace. But English referees see themselves at the center of the narrative when at home/in the British tabloids, so what do you expect?Eduardo Galeano is spinning in his grave...we had soccer in both sun AND shadow tonight.EDIT: Couldn't give two shits about your downvotes...what I've said is absolute truth...the referee placed himself at the center of everything tonight, when the natural flow of the game would have placed, at minimum, Buffon v CR7 at the center. Red card for WHAT? For being upset at a 93rd minute soft-ass penalty? Man, GTFO..."
dx7y6kh,tnzk01,Dude shush. It was a clear fucking foul. Benetia just lost his head at the last second.
dx84s3q,get_unoffended,Absolutely and utterly ruined the tie.
dx8441o,Facel_Vega,I agree with you too. It was a soft penalty. You don't just don't make that call at that moment.
dx7fd2t,berghh,Real Madrid and corruption. Name a more iconic duo
dx7hs6s,UneasyInsider,Barca and corruption?
dx7rseb,lucash7,"So Ronaldo and his ego get gifted the win with what was (imo) a questionable call, typical CL/ref. God how I cannot stand the guy; gifted player no doubt but his ego...here's hoping someone besides RM win this year or we'll never hear the end of his “I'm the greatest” schtick. Heck, I'll take Bayern over them (*shudders* as a BVB fan id never hear the end of it admittedly...) .Yes yes, I'll probably get down voted by all the Ronaldo/RM fans, so be it. Cheers. Edit: spelling"
dx7z9ie,tnzk01,"Why was the celebration for his sick goal last week humble?He has an ego on the field, but he got the adrenaline rush when he converted the penalty because it literally bailed his team out. That's why he's celebrating like a mad man. He wants trophies. He wants to be a winner. Fuck with my latest comments I must sound like a Ronaldo apologist. Some of you guys though just don't understand a winning mentality. Go watch a kid's league then where everyone gets a trophy and motm is rotated so the little fat child can also feel like a winner."
dx7sajm,BrewMaiden,Agreed.
dx7pljh,justinjj1,Soft as baby shit penalty. Football is not a non-contact sport. Barely touching someones back and then kicking the balls is not a fucking penalty.
dx7qy5r,fagers91,*Stoke City*
dx7xm6m,Ask_Asensio,Kicking someone chest and not touching the ball it's now called soft lmao
dx7s084,TuneyTune92,thank you

dx7hwvr,cyanide1403,"English refs need to stay away until they get some proper training, stick to refereeing Aldershot FC for now mate."
dx7elze,NotClayMerritt,There is a reason no English ref is going to the World Cup this summer.

dx7f66z,ivnstts,Bullshit penalty
dx7f85r,salutcemoi,WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWOOOOOOOOOOO
dx7fysl,thisisdropd,"Not a good move from Buffon. Had he kept his cool, he might've saved the penalty and the match will go into extra time. With the momentum in Juve's favour, they could pull a miracle. However, with his sending off, even if the penalty missed they are at a numerical disadvantage."
dx7gknj,Lumaty,I think he pulls out of the challenge and vasquez was already bending over by chesting it down.. but I'm probably biased
dx7jc85,javk5pakfa,"Unlike most of the folks on this sub who have the luxury to review the footage a thousand times, the ref had one second and that was it. Vasquez took advantage of it definitely, but it wasn't the wrong call."
dx7uytp,TheAndredal,was that really a penalty?
dx7v6a9,TheMessiah24,"It was a clear foul, but not all fouls are called as penalties. Otherwise, there'd be a penalty every corner kick."
dx7vkew,TheAndredal,"alright, it was hard to see from the angle they showed"
dx8dhh4,Siralosmdk,"I'm sorry, but you are not right. From FIFA rules:A penalty kick is awarded if any of the above ten offences is committed by a player inside his own penalty area, irrespective of the position of the ball, provided it is in play.Page 36https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf"
dx7vdal,koko949,"i was watching this game earlier while i was eating lunch and noticed that the scoreboard said 1-3 but RM still won and then at the bottom of the screen it said something like ""4-3 based on aggregate""can someone ELI5 what ""based on aggregate"" means? the score was 1-3 when i was watching. was there a prior game played that was 3-0?"
dx7vwxy,Rezey,"Aggregate - over two legs. Real Madrid played last week away and scored 3 goals. Juventus came back in the second leg away and matched Real for an aggregate score on 3-3 until this penalty which made the total score between both legs 4-3, going to Real.Away goals also count for 2 goals when there's a tie in the aggregate btw."
dx7w0hl,koko949,thank you!
dx7vsj9,Rarehero,"> the score was 1-3 when i was watching. was there a prior game played that was 3-0? Yes. That's how the Champions League and the Euro League work. Two matches, scored goals win, away goals count extra as a tie breaker (say 1-1 in the first match, 2-2 in the second, the team that scored more away goals advances)."
dx7vxdi,koko949,"ahh okay, that makes sense. thank you!"
dx93m7w,dragonjock27,"UEFA: Good job, ref. We can't afford to have both Barca and Real Madrid miss the semis. Here's your cash.Buffon should have knocked that refs teeth out"
dx93ot3,dragonjock27,"God, I fucking hate Real"
dx87ogk,olaysanjose,unpopular opinion I don't think it's a penalty (in hindsight) if someone stops and waits for the contact
dx8d1i1,Siralosmdk,"He didn't know the defender was behind, how can he wait for the contact?"
dx9v9iu,olaysanjose,"didn't know? that's a stretch. just think he went down super easy, not surprised or angry just the way of the game now a days. personally think the best option would have been to step forward and attack the ball for some sort of side volley...waiting and waiting right in front of the goal you've got to know the defender you've been fighting with is right on your heels. he waited until he felt that and went down right away"
dx7ecs7,CelphT,The jews did this
dx7lxwl,BatmansBumBoy,"Buffon let himself down a bag full. No sympathy for Juventus with how their players acted after the penalty decision. It's annoying in the other hand too how the best teams around have to dive and use theatrics constantly, making the most of every challenge to swindle the referee. Leaves a bitter taste"
dx7fd9l,CementAggregate,Real Madrid and Ronaldo just became the laughingstock of Europe
dx7ff31,FuckingWrongDumbass,But they went through? On a deserved penalty call?
dx7fmk1,CementAggregate,After blowing a 3-0 away lead.
dx7fx2m,_ae_,"errr, how would they be the laughing stock, after almost blowing a 3 goal lead, when barca actually did blow a 3 goal lead the night before?"
dx7g5s6,CementAggregate,3-0 AWAY lead.
dx7gg03,_ae_,"never said it wasnt, just curious how being close to blowing the lead makes them a laughing stock, while the team that actually did blow the lead, against an arguably much worse team, doesnt become the laughing stock?"
dx7gpd3,CementAggregate,"If we start nitpicking, then we can put all three teams on the same pedestal.But to me this cemented Real Madrid's position. No team should ever rely on a bad dive for a last-minute referee save after leading 3-0 on away goals.This isn't the first time. The referee saved them last round while they were 1-0 down with Kroos offside on another soft pk call. Then the blatant Modric dive."
dx7fo50,Sertorius777,That is not a deserved penalty call. Vazquez stops and goes to the ground as fast he feels Benatia coming. If that were to happen in the other box it would have never been given.
dx7l5sz,FuckingWrongDumbass,"Completely unrelated, do you play in real life? At a high or low level?"

dx7erkj,zaphodbx,last year was the same. and it doesn't count for me
dx7fncj,AndrewRealm,Just like Ronaldo's 2017 balon d'or doesnt count either.
dx7e82s,electrohelal,FUCK YEAH
dx7edck,Tiagoff,Fucking ruined one of the best games in recent history
dx7ljnh,Roscoe8182,"idc what minute that was, that was not a penalty. Lucas Vasquez goes to ground incredibly easy with minimal contact. The ball was below chest level there to be won. Ridiculous decision"
dx7nf4x,Menessy27,and he didnt win the ball and kicked him in the side so im not sure why that matters
dx7mhmg,hennyV,"Despite the dive, Benatia went through Vasquez to get to the ball. He had no play on the ball without making making contact with Vasquez first."
dx7wr7p,Tomahawkk2468,Shouldn't have been a penalty. It's so obvious that Real have been paying off referees in the UCL for the past couple years
dx7ybic,tnzk01,I don't know what's more obvious : Benetia committing the foul on Vasquez or your severe case of wrongitis.If you ain't blind YouTube forever has that moment Benetia lost it.
dx7zywd,TheStryfe,You couldn't be more wrong
dx89n1t,skunkrider,"Is there a massive infectious brain-sucking virus going around, or why does everybody say it's a fair penalty?Are you all out of your minds?Benatia doesn't touch him, except with the foot, *from the front*, and the attacker still tumbles forward.Since when did Football become a contactless sport?I'm getting too old for this shit."
dx8dja9,Lagainsttheworld,"Have it ever occur to you, that you might be in the wrong, and everyone else is correct?The push is fairy obvious from every angel."
dx8bp29,En_Panda,"How stupid are you? ""Benatia doesn't touch him"" So hands in the back doesn't count I guess.You say that Lucas is already diving before Benatia touches him? Lucas was trying to chest the ball, that is why he leans the way he does."
dx8frps,divinity_hs,"you're idiot. ""how stupid youre are"" - you can ask yourself this question. I think it was penalty, but why do you need to write people such shit for DIFFERENT OPINION on controversy penalty."

dx8e7jk,skunkrider,"It's not about leaning, it's about the feet tripping, which happened even before Benatia touched him.> How stupid are you?Not stupid enough to fall for a shameful dive."
dx8e9o9,En_Panda,So now all of a sudden he does touch him?! Did you change your mind when Benatia actually admited he pushed him?
dx8edfh,skunkrider,"Reading is difficult, eh.> Benatia doesn't touch him, **except with the foot**."
dx8eiur,En_Panda,"Well he did, and he admitted that he pushed him. So your argument fails pretty hard. Or I guess you could know better that Benatia himself..."
dx8ak2b,sizzlelikeasnail,Since when are you allowed to kick a players chest? Look how much force went into it. The push knocked him off balance and the kick sent him flyinghttps://streamable.com/ft51k
dx8b6ot,skunkrider,"Look! The attacker's feet are already in dive position a moment before Benatia touches him.Dive, and no penalty."
dx8fcg8,nafraf,"What the fuck is "" dive position""? Vazquez is focused on controlling the ball and doesn't even see Benatia behind him. He loses balance the moment Benatia puts both hands on his back."
dx8c812,sizzlelikeasnail,He's lowering himself to chest the ball because the header came to him at an awkward height. You can visibly see that your post is untrue. Pause it right before Vazquez's eyes widen and his head moves forward.If it was a more regular pass he would've just done a header and been done with it. However the chest would've worked too if Benatia hadn't thrown off his balance by pushing him. Also realise that this is slow motion. It looks like there was a gap + there wasn't that much force. In real-time they basically happened together and with more force.
dx8e9yx,skunkrider,"> If it was a more regular pass he would've just done a header and been done with it. However the chest would've worked too if Benatia hadn't thrown off his balance by pushing him.Nonsense. You can head a ball that is lower than your head, but he doesn't seem to have the technique for it.> Also realise that this is slow motion. It looks like there was a gap + there wasn't that much force. In real-time they basically happened together and with more force.Did you proofread what you just wrote? This is even worse nonsense.If B happens before A, A cannot have caused B. Whether you watch in real time or slow-motion doesn't matter."

dx7fmy4,gvanmoney,10 years ago and that's not a pen

dx7f7bm,TheCoMA,"relevant flair, the decision was correct"
dx7eprk,TheyComeCrawlingBack,THEREWASNOFOUL.JUVE GOT ROBBED. FUCK THIS. FUCK THE REFEREES. I'm not even a Juve fan.. but this game was a game that would add a page to Italian football history. Now it's just a fucking stain.
dx7etmw,Dylz919,Not a penalty? What qualifies as one then? Maybe if he had shot him?
dx7extm,TheyComeCrawlingBack,"He plays the ball, end of story."
dx7f4h5,Dylz919,You may want to rewatch that. That's a clear penalty.
dx7erhg,alexmtl,"There was clearly a foul. Everyone has a different opinion.Think about how yellow cards are given on challenges. If you tackle and don't touch the ball, it's a foul. He didn't touch the ball, so it's a foul in the penalty box -> penalty."
dx7evpi,TheyComeCrawlingBack,"I mean.. why would you state ""There was clearly a foul"" as if it was a fact and follow that up with ""Everyone has a different opinion"" ?"
dx7h4p3,alexmtl,That's my opinion? I'm going by the rules of what a foul is. He made the player fall and he didn't touch the ball -> foul
dx7go9x,nailsinch9,"So let's see... Madrid gets their asses kicked at home...uh huh. ""Earn"" a bullshit PK with no time left from a dive. Yup. Ronaldo, who did nothing all game, steps up and scores from the spot and gets all the accolades. Check. And an English ref behind it all. Totally makes sense."
dx7gw4u,mrblue6,What part of that doesn't make sense?
dx7h09e,nailsinch9,Exactly. It ALL makes sense.
dx7hrj7,dj1200techniques,Los madridistas son mas bajos que una cagaleche. Dont even acknowledge him
dx7le8m,Soren_Camus1905,Juve deserved more. Fucking Madrid go away
dx7lkik,Siralosmdk,Did you really watch the match? Real Madrid did much more in Torino than Juventus did in Madrid; how come they deserved it more?
dx7upec,ortz3,Yeah we were the better side from minute 5 until we got the red card in the 65th
dx8xmg0,Soren_Camus1905,"I just meant Juve deserved more, given what they had accomplished in the match they at least deserved extra time. It's not that I thought Juve were the better side over two legs, I just thought the way went out was a bit harsh. And also, i'm tired of seeing Madrid."
dx7mun9,Flacko115,You lot got worked for 90 minutes today. Absolutely abysmal. Your “goat” spent half the game crying on the ground. Didn't deserve to go through

dx7sh8u,TuneyTune92,LOL yes
dx8c0bc,Siralosmdk,"Possession, shots, passes. Juventus was lucky (helped by the defense) and scored 2 goals in two shots on first half. I recognise Madrid played a very bad game, but Real Madrid played much better in Torino than Juventus did in Madrid; that's undeniable."
dx7gcjj,bhodrolok,Hardly a penalty & never a straight red! Bad end to a great game.
dx7ge55,DavyH5,Clearly a pen and a red lol. Lucky benatia didn't get a red too
dx7e8ls,Zlatan132,11 in a row!
dx7fbos,karagiosis79,"This was a disgrace...no contact on Vasquez. I've NEVER seen a player get a straight red for verbals. And it wasn't just any player...Gigi Buffon, the Juventus captain, the Italian captain, the man who is the first to congratulate the other team after a loss. What could he have possibly said to warrant a straight red."
dx7flbg,andaru01,Wasnt just vocals he put his hands on the ref multiple times. Just cant do that
dx7fs5g,MikePap,"Why the red card though... as an experienced referee you know that a player will handle that way that specific situation , no matter what he said to him , we've all seen much much worse . It seems to me that Oliver wanted to be the centre of attention sadly ."
dx7g4vc,onedestiny,Um agression from a player and also you have no idea what buffon said to him
dx7g3l3,thalne,man what a way to ruin a great game of football.
dx7egun,danielvandam,"So fucking lucky, Real always get away with everything every year. Pathetic from the ref"
dx7hozy,UneasyInsider,"In the kindest way possible, you are fucking retarded."
dx7f1mc,starwarsVrocks,It's all of the refs for Madrid games. Feel pressured to make calls they shouldn't.
dx7f2ma,hawkeye224,"Yep, you can say that some of this luck might be earned, but still no other team has pretty much 100% luck percentage like Real.. that's why I freakin' hate them. I respect their skills and their fans though.."
dx7fwax,Manlad,But it's not luck when the penalty was deserved.
dx7ebbi,Volitient,fucking cunts
dx7g437,RealPunyParker,OF COURSE Madrid will get a penalty at 90+7 minutes to let them go through.Why the fuck did i ever doubt this would happen.
dx7g612,DavyH5,Not like it's an undeserved pen though
dx7gcj5,RealPunyParker,Soft but yes.It is.
dx7gc1y,EArobbedme,"I swear anyone who thinks that is a pen have never played football. The softest shit i have ever seen in my life, how can ruin a game like that with that shit."
dx7ghwf,DavyH5,"Man he quite clearly pushes him in the back, not sure how that's unclear."
dx7gvob,EArobbedme,"People saying it's a pen cause he kicked him now it's pushed, the guy was chesting the ball in the box benatia did nothing wrong. I'm sorry Ronaldo diving alll game long and you ruin a game like that. fixed 100%"

dx7ffy2,orionpaper,Champions for a reason? Ref is the reason.
dx7ge1x,gazeebo,Immunity to cards and free penalties. Is that like a subscription package?
dx7fhm1,Falcon9535,Oh fuck off you pompous plastic twat
dx7fzgw,Shinkopeshon,"Out of all clubs in the world, Real is the least deserving one to get this kind of luck. It was a soft foul but an official *could* call a pen and while others wouldn't have, I can't blame him for doing so. However, the red was too much. Sure, Buffon exploded (not justifying it but let's be real: Who wouldn't lose their shit at a last-minute pen call?) but a yellow would've sufficed, given the circumstances. The red was just kicking them when they were already down. I mean, come on."
dx7ghk2,monk3ybusin3ss,Real players were falling like little bitches the whole game. How surprising that it lead to a penalty in the 93rd.
dx7gm45,jyb5394,So were Juve players. They were rougher than Real today.
dx7gm31,Louieando,"Real Madrid played horrible, yet the questionable penalty will remove all that especially since Penaldo scored it."
dx7h092,tijdverdrijf,"Ref needs to be 100 % certain and I don't believe that he could be, shouldn't have given it. Off topic: It's incredible that Ronaldo got through the match without a card for simulation"
dx7hkpy,Styphelus,Why not? He was right there to see it. In slow mo it looks like it could have been a soft touch but as it happened it looked more severe. He wasn't expecting the push and he was in an obvious goal scoring position.
dx7p6eh,tijdverdrijf,"It's like offside calls, the linesman has to be 100% sure of his call, as we saw yesterday, with the trickerhappy linesmen against city, who clearly went on feel rather than what he actually saw. If the ref was sure that he was in an obvious goal scoring position, surely he would have given Chiellini a red card instead of a yellow one?"
dx7hdlw,pumbasimo,That was not a clear penalty. Granted you can't see everything live (thinking from the point of view from the referee) however the player went down too easily. Notice om how the defender running back didn't stop in his motion - if it was a clear barge surely that would have reflected in his movement.It's salty to think that:1) Games like City and Juve today are still susceptible to a large extent to refereeing influence2) Players are ready to abolish their morals in the name of victory. How can you celebrate a win like that?
dx7hi1v,trees-for-breakfast,Lucas Vasquez is a weak little man
dx7pnun,sarcastictrey,Shaq said it best - “People paid good money to come watch these athletes play and they [the refs] try to take over the fucking game!”
dx7t67z,Grammatonn,It was a penalty though. He knees him in the chest.
dx7v6fn,sarcastictrey,"Knees him in the chest? Really? That's a stretch. I do agree it was a foul, but you gotta swallow the whistle on that one man. Let the players decide the game. It's not like Real was gonna lose if the game ended. If they were better team, they would've won in extra time, no? I believe they were better side, but they should've had to earn the win in extra time, not get the game handed to them in the final seconds on dubious officiating."
dx7zffb,tnzk01,"Look at it another way :if Juve had it in the bag, Benetia wouldn't have made a rash tackle and Buffon shouldn't have lost his head.No dubious officiating. Simply dubious mentality that Juve fucked up in the last few seconds."
dx80q8f,sarcastictrey,"Fair enough, I can definitely see both sides. Again, I'm not saying it wasn't a foul. I just hate it when games end like that in any pro sport. I still don't think Gigi warranted a red, but he's a pro he should know better. I didn't think Isco was offsides earlier, so I guess it worked out, however unsatisfactory the ending."
dx7xl58,Grammatonn,Are you fucking kidding me?Lucas had an easy tap-in and he was fouled.
dx806ph,TheStryfe,Cept that quote doesn't apply here one bit
dx7tzhu,Lagainsttheworld,"As clear as a penalty can get,"

dx8c55v,GoJeonPaa,Wow didn't think a Madrid fan would agree.
dx8ekei,owndpepe,He didn't
dx8msin,GoJeonPaa,But he showed me a stream of the dive? So i thought he agrees.
dx8odop,owndpepe,He was ironic
dx8qan7,GoJeonPaa,"I know bro, i was too."
dx8r0ti,owndpepe,Jesus I'm stupid
dx7g3am,StallionPrime,Real madrid fans arent real football fans. Bandwagoning cunts. Mostly american and salvadorians
dx7gjph,BashTheBlu,Ayy lmao
dx7emic,slacksabbath,Fuck off and leave your shirt on you absolute cunt.
dx7jw6t,javk5pakfa,His goal and he gets to celebrate in whatever way he desires.
dx7fjp1,OGmaloney,Of course Penaldo had to take his shirt off and run to the crowd after scoring from 6 yards out... such a cunt.
dx7ghch,,"Seeing as he was on 2 goals and 1 assist in his tie, I think he's entitled to run to the crowd after scoring the game winning penalty.Especially when the opportunity presented itself due to his massive leap anyway."
dx8gpt2,OGmaloney,"Ok but it's just that, a penalty... do you think if Benzema or Isco or whoever stepped up and took the PK that they would take their shirt off and act like they are God's gift to earth?"
dx8gv72,,I doubt it. But they aren't anywhere as good as Ronaldo. It wouldn't make sense for them to be as confident as him. He regularly gets Real Madrid through tough matches and he did it again. Messi took his shirt off and waved it infront of of Real Madrid fans ffs. It's not a big deal. People have different ways of expression passion. Plus Ronaldo knows getting a yellow doesn't matter because they get wiped in the semi finals anyway. Marcelo has done it too btw
dx8hgtf,OGmaloney,"He barely even showed up in this game.. it took a penalty (which I agree was rightfully a penalty) for him to win the game. Where was he before the pk? All I'm saying is, he played sub par the entire game, stepped up and took a penalty (which literally any other player on that team could take). It was nothing special, we all knew he was going to score on Szczęsny."
dx7heor,Gliese581-c,"If it was the other way around, the pen wouldn't have been called, nor 7 minutes would be given. Every year something like this happens with Real, it's sickening. Last year vs Bayern was bad but this is just as bad."
dx7i5qk,nybreath,"Pretty sure the pen was awarded around 2.55 on extra time, once awarded a pen has to be shoot."
dx7hhpe,Psych_0ut,"Putting the penalty aside. The only reason the game went to seven minutes was because of the penalty no? Honestly I can't remember so correct me if I'm wrong, but I swore there was 3 minutes of time added and it went to 7 because of the foul, card, fighting and all of that."
dx7hl32,,"You forgot the fact that Juve had to substitute their fucking goalkeeper in those ""seven"" minutes."
dx7hiw0,,7 minutes? Did you even watch the game?
dx7j9mp,Miloren1,"Benatia barely touched him and the Madrid guy just dived when he felt there was contact. Football is a sport in which contact is something that happens all the time, if you think that was a penalty then you think that every time a player is touched is a tackle and thus a penalty. That's just lack of knowledge about the game"
dx7ld6a,mbaban,"[""barely""](https://streamable.com/ft51k)"
dx7m3gg,m0dthispny,Love what you're doing here haha. You show ‘em!
dx7kfd9,CR7_Bale_Lovechild,"Benatia is at least six inches taller and at least 30 lbs heavier than Vasquez, who was light on his feet as he tried to control the ball. It doesn't take much m8. He clearly shoves Vasquez in the back with both hands, and misses the ball with his foot. It's a poor tackle from behind. Foul. Penalty."
dx7k28w,sportsfan161,Doesn't matter if he barely touched him he fouled him so it's a pen
dx7k5gd,Miloren1,How can you foul without contact? LOL
dx7k88e,sportsfan161,There was contact his leg got him as he was about to shoot

dx7fnhn,WilanW,"It was a clear penalty, but the red card for Buffon shows to me that referees have no feel for the emotions of the players during a match. It's the 90th minute and you give a potential-game deciding penalty to the home team after a 3-0 comeback by the away team in the QF of the Champions League. Just give the pen and finish the game."
dx7gya9,Timmeyy_,He has to take his shirt of doesn't he? Such a stupid way to get a yellow. Was really rooting for Juve tonight. Two Italian teams making amazing comebacks against two Spanish superpowers would have been an incredible story.Props to Real Madrid
dx8226y,EZ-Pizza,Please excuse me for being a clueless American who only really watches the World Cup...How did Real Madrid win if they were down 2 goals? Does Champions League play by goal differentials or something?
dx829a9,Sexyman469,"It's by two games. One game in Madrid, one in Turin. They add the two scores together. First game was 3-0 for Madrid, this game was 3-1 for juve. Aggregate shoe is 4-3.Also if they're tied on goals, they give it to the team with more away goals"
dx82on7,EZ-Pizza,"> Also if they're tied on goals, they give it to the team with more away goalsAway goals over the course of the whole tournament or just the 2 game series?If Ronaldo didn't get that pen, wouldn't it have been an even tie?"
dx83u7x,Sexyman469,"Just the two game series. And if they didn't get the pen and it was 3-0 at the end of regular time, they would go to extra time (two 15 minutes halves).If no one scores and they're still tied after that, it's a penalty shootout"
dx84p6v,EZ-Pizza,"Ohh, duh. Idk why I completely forgot about penalty shootouts lolThank you for the explanations!"
dx828v3,chrimbo,"This was the second game of a two-leg tie. In the first game, Real Madrid won 3-0 away.In this second game, Juventus made a miraculous comeback and scored 3 away goals at Madrid's stadium. On aggregate, this made the score 3-3 across the two games, and in the final minutes, Madrid were awarded a penalty and scored, winning the whole tie."
dx852gp,BrianDawkins,Champions league playoff games are in series of 2. One home one away. Goals get counted for both games and whoever has the most after 2 games advances. The final though is only 1 game
dx8d07c,Vasilevskiy,"Real carried by officiating, shocker."
dx7e9sm,GarciLP,"Not a penalty. Juve was absolutely robbed. A disgrace, utter and complete disgrace."
dx7ekha,ShadowDandy,"Same to bayern last champions, its just Real UEFA until CR7 or messi retires"
dx7fu6u,Faizan24839,"Even as a real madrid fan, a part of me was wishing he'd miss that penalty."
dx7fysd,MarquisJames,Lol wut
dx7g2dn,Teronomik,Not sure why everybody says it was the right call? This was definetily Not a pen. He got baerly touched. Not worth a penalty He really wanted that. Sad das...
dx7g6ii,Bisark,Benathia touched the ball... clearly. You can't give this kind of pen at 93'
dx7htok,,[deleted]
dx7i924,Dubsified,Its a clear as day penalty. If that was the other way around you would be freaking out had it not been called. Once you look back you will see. Its easy to blame the ref for a defensive lapse by Juventus.
dx7ilfm,shoutouttoallmypearz,He hit the ball with a flying challenge from behind in the box and brought the player down. Can also see that he gets pushed in the back before the defender even went for the ball
dx7iryi,,[deleted]
dx7j6gw,nybreath,"""If it hits the ball it isn't foul"" is a very old myth, but anyway, Benatia hits the ball well after he pushed down the player. It is hard to say how hard is the push, but really you, as a defender, cannot ever push with you hands on an attacker's back, if the referee whistles you have to blame only yourself. I don't think this is as clear as many says, but this is a very fair pen, I would have given this too if I was the referee."

dx7ksce,2STRONKK,delusiona
dx7upv6,OAKgravedigger,Juve were robbed
dx8023v,TheStryfe,Said absolutely no one
dx80mhl,OAKgravedigger,Benatia was on the left side of Vazquez trying to play the ball instead of Lucas trying to just crowd around to draw contact. It's such a soft call
dx80sxx,TheStryfe,"Wasn't trying to play the ball he was completely behind him, pushed him with two hands on his back, it was a clear pen"
dx81562,OAKgravedigger,"> pushed him with two hands on his backIf you watch the actual penalty (and not what you believe happened) it's clearly seen that Benatia does not even extend his arms (not even 45 degrees) so how can he be pushing him if he's not extending his arms to push? Even Hellen Keller could see Benatia didn't push Vasquez down but to position himself, without using force, to get around Vasquez's goal side"
dx8179w,TheStryfe,Exhibit A https://imgur.com/gallery/7uElB
dx81d05,OAKgravedigger,"And his arms didn't extend forward against Vasquez, Stevie Wonder can even see that"
dx82fn6,Sexyman469,"Dude two hands on the back, knee in the back and kick in the ribs.https://streamable.com/ft51kIt's a penalty lol. It doesn't matter if he was trying to play the ball. Most fouls are players trying to get the ball."
dx81lxe,TheStryfe,"But they did, they started extended when he pushed, and he made full body contact before ever touching the ball. Textbook foul"
dx8284m,OAKgravedigger,Yet Benatia's hands don't follow Vasquez to ground like they would when it's an actual foul and not going down at the slightest bit of contact
dx82l8d,TheStryfe,"Lucas was already off balance and didn't know he was about to be pushed, easiest combination of being off balanced and falling. Two hand push in the back plus the high kick to the chest is a foul anywhere on the pitch"

dx7et5y,JustMetod,This is why Ronaldo will never be near Messi. Even if he scores 600 goals in one year any remotely decent human being wont give it to him. To celebrate after this is inconcievable and it means he has no human decency left in him. Truly a new low for this little prick.
dx7ffui,_ae_,"Curious about what you say about Buffon? Insulting and pointing fingers at the referee? Clearly shows complete lack of respect for another human being, let alone an authority figure. to ever consider him as a role model is beyond retarded.its almost as if people get carried away in the heat of the moment? crazy, i know.the new low of human decency. celebrating euphorically by taking off his shirt when he just scored in the last minute to qualify his team to the next stage of champions league.Mate, if your angry at a certain situation, take a couple deep breaths, and let some time pass before you post stuff, it avoids posting dumb shit."

dx7ejnv,SZJX,Fuck that. I'd really want to see RM win a CL while being on the receiving end of ridiculous decisions. All their recent CL wins have been totally BS. Hopefully they'll be dumped out immediately in the semis already.
dx7ekao,Holymani,Another team robbed. Just like yesterday with BULLSHIT calls. Fucking pathetic to watch. VAR can't get here faster.

dx7eoxv,tek9knaller,"lol called it like 40min ago on discord, Real to advance with extra time penalty or offside goal as always. Ridiculous."
dx7eozg,GeauxSuperBayern,Only Real gets this call
dx7epa3,fuckingjets,If this weak shitis a penalty how is Casemiro's handball and hit on Morata last week wasn't? Fucking bullshit
dx7epjn,HeungMinSon,This is fucking pathetic. Nice one RM lmao.
dx7epmi,GumerBaby,Not a Pen in my opinion.

dx7esgl,Gerf93,I don't know what I expected. Nothing can stop Real from winning three in a row.
dx7esr1,BobsTea,Definitely a penalty and there is not a goalkeeper on earth who would have saved that. Harsh on Juve. They were unbelievable and should be proud.
dx7et44,dkearns49,"Whole play was set up by Ronaldo heading to his teammate instead of going for the hero goal. Excellent vision & absolutely ruthless finish. Very tough for Juve, but it looked like the right call"
dx7eur1,MurphyFtw,Michael Oliver is a terrible referee and Real Madrid could go down under a slight gust of wind. So irritating to watch even as a neutral.

dx7ey3f,deludedDudes,A last minute penalty by Ronaldo was definitely the best way to shut up a lottttt of folks....shameful card for Buffon though
dx7f08r,ruthekangaroo,Nothing will shut me up about those pathetic dives. Absolutely disgusting.
dx7fmey,deludedDudes,Id agree some of them were dives early on but last one was a foul as well. I wouldnt deny that Lucas was waiting for the push but that deos not stop it from being a foul
dx7g6s5,ruthekangaroo,How does Lucas being fouled(he was) suppose to make me shut up about Ronaldo's shitty dives? Is that suppose to vindicate him?
dx7gqlf,deludedDudes,I didnt say anything on shutting up about the dives ....just for those hating the match and last minute specifically. Totally agree with you about Ronaldo dives though. Nothing vindicates his lack of effort towards attacking gameplay and focus on dives
dx7f5t5,Kwabena7,yea just diving all match to then get a lucky penalty and act like the goat right? invisible the whole match lmfao
dx7f12t,zorkek,"I think the call was correct, it wasn't a clear penalty but still. Proud of what Juventus did tonight, at least the showed that they are almost level with Real Madrid, even with no Ronaldo. It would have been a dream to have 2 Italian team in the semi with those great comeback... Anyway, Forza Roma!Also, really the worst career ending for Buffon between this and the (non) WC quali, gotta feel sorry for him"

dx7fg9l,antukirs,The ref added too many minutes to extra time imo.Could see why no English refs in WC...sad for Juve
dx7fk9n,SimpleSamples,(Penalty + Call)Call?
dx7fu4p,Fsociety07,My hats off to buffon. The man played a hell of a match. Was a bit disappointed he red carded himself. IMO he should've taken on that pen with pride!!
dx7g1xp,sAnn92,Parece Boca.

dx7on89,baaka_cupboard,"Can't deny, we gave a better show than Real did on their own home ground."
dx8md05,Kermanshahh,"Ronaldo is literally the best player to have ever existed, but why did god make him such a cutie too. I'm so jealous!"
dxa6ntc,webtuti,people can say many things but it was clearly a penalty
dx7eapr,Mantis_Toboggan27,Eat shit /r/soccer
dx7ggcf,EArobbedme,Ronaldo dives all game and the ref ruins the game like this i'm done.
dx7goyo,lambomrclago,That was a penalty.

dx7hdaf,halfelven23,"dude, if we got a penalty from welbeck against milan, this is 100000000% a penalty"

dx7hmld,halfelven23,"well, how much you care does not actually matter"
dx7hsgf,EArobbedme,"This was such a great game and fucking michael oliver ruins it, it's a crime lock him up no joke."
dx7wpeb,lambomrclago,"If the small amount of redditors that saw this post agree with me you'll have to believe the majority of anyone who saw what I saw believe what I believe. The defender clearly interfered and knocked him over, it's just a penalty - regardless of how shitty it was in the context of the game."
dx7ef0r,zagreus9,Michael Oliver you imbecile
dx7hj61,niner-nation,yeah how dare he make the proper call on a stupid challenge by Benatia.
dx7eq1m,opacino,These English refs need to be banned from Champions League football for 1 season. Pathetic.
dx7js88,littlemessi101,That was disgusting from the ref. No way should that had been a pen imo.
dx7lbnw,mbaban,[This](https://streamable.com/ft51k) isn't a pen ?
dx7k0qg,CR7_Bale_Lovechild,but you're wrong.
dx7l5xy,Syctris,Yeah.. he pushed the guy over in the box by jumping on his back and wrapping his leg around him... How the fuck is that not a penalty...
dx7ea5d,Tiagoff,Fuck this shit
dx86i3e,hodl_,Why was there 7 minutes of extra time ? Rigged competition

dx8kkr5,icezzzgod,"Why is it disgusting? Buffon can't do what he did, so he got punished"
dx9c9b3,aarosakura,"everyone does this, buffon is the only one to get sent off. You have to be consistant across all of football for this to be ok."
dx9cv4u,icezzzgod,someone doesnt know the rules
dx9dvoj,aarosakura,"I do, it's just that this never gets punished like this. Just happens to be that the ref decides to actually punish this in the 94th minute of a massive champions league game."
dx9e834,icezzzgod,"Just because everyone parks in a no parking zone, doesnt mean it's allowed, a police can come by any time and give a ticket to everyoneSame rule applies"

dx9g6fc,aarosakura,"Then those cops aren't doing their jobs properly. I think this is my point, there has to be consistency. If you're going to throw the book at one person you have to throw the book at everyone."
dx7eka3,Tmistro,Are you joking ? It's a clear red...
dx7epi9,TrippyMane,Lmao disgusting sending off? Buffon is their captain and lost his head completely you can be the oldest or best player in the world but if you charge at the ref the way he did red is deserved
dx7i5fm,aarosakura,A ref should understand how to handle players. This happens all the time and he happens to decide it's a good idea to give him a straight red at this specific point? Sure.
dx7iq7y,TrippyMane,I think he handled it perfectly any Madrid player doing it how Buffon did it gets a red and I have no complains at all. If anything red handled it beautifully. How about Buffon learns to handle it better and not lose his head. For fuck sakes the guy has endless experience
dx7kpya,shun-goku-satsu,Lol this is such BS... Referee had pity and gave them the pk.
dx7l72y,mbaban,[This](https://streamable.com/ft51k) isn't a pen ?
dx7n6o2,BashTheBlu,This should be it's own post if it isn't already. It's a proper penalty call.
dx7lz0o,m0dthispny,Great angle.
dx7mcxl,shun-goku-satsu,"He goes for the ball! What about the red card that was not given to kroos during the first half after that kick to khedira. Since barca failed, the Spanish were freaking out. They really wanted one of their teams to reach semis lol"
dx7mqub,mbaban,He goes for the ball ? If i shoot someone in the head but say im going for the wall behind them that would still get me behind bars you know. 1. He pushes him from behind way before he even moves to the ball. 2. He kicks him on the fucking ribs barely even touching the ball. the ball doesn't change direction at all. 3. that was basically a goal if it wasnt for Benatia doing what he did. 4. whataboutism now ? video of that incidence please.General life advise: don't let your bias affect your objectivism. I loved Juve's story as well but that was a 110% pen.
dx7p843,shun-goku-satsu,Lol Madrid fans TRIGGERED. I hope they get bayern in semis and get knocked out
dx7pcwd,mbaban,"Really ? After trying to engage you in an intelligent conversation, this is the response ? Sigh, whatever my dude, hope you are a young one otherwise this would be just sad"

dx7elzs,ALLGROWWITHLOVE,"Go fuck yourself Real , had 3:0 scorecast Juve to win and of course they concede a penalty in last 20 seconds of the game fuck my life."
dx7eqqj,Theingloriousak2,That penalty was easily deserved
dx7et3o,Inigou,We were never going to lose
dx7f5o7,JJaysNotHome,You did lose. You went through but you did lose lol
dx7f6s9,ImissDenisirwin,That is NOT a penalty!
dx7fkeh,GeauxSuperBayern,Vazquez jumped before he even was kicked or touched embarrassing
dx7g662,pintvricchio,Fucking travesty
dx7gmhu,deadlygr,we ve seen way worst pens than that but its a shame we didnt get to see et in a great game football its a really hard game sometimes to me its a 50/50 decision kudos to juve for playing a great game
dx7otwf,Losbalancos7,WHOEVER DOESNT THINK THAT IS PENALTY SHOULD JUST KILL THEMSELVES HATS OFF TO JUVE BUT WHEN YOU PLAY AGAINST RONALDO TAKES ONE SECOND ALL GAME HE WAS THE ONLY ONE TRYING TO HARD TELLING THE FANS TO MAKE NOISE JUMPED REALLY HIGH FOR THAT BALL GOT IT CLEAR PK AND HIT IT TOP CORNER FOOTBALL CAN BE UNFAIR SOMETIMES
dx7i6ix,ComicalAli,Its a foul and a dive.
dx7ih5d,akaneuer2,Cant be both
dx7ivjh,ComicalAli,Yes it can. He went down too softly. He felt the contact then decided to hit the deck. Blatant dive.
dx7jqm6,akaneuer2,"You said it, he made contact. While in full sprint he pushed Vasquez in his back"
dx7vqad,PeanutButter000,"Why tf did he celebrate like he just won the world cup, his team played like shit and they needed a penalty to be bailed out, hopefully they get knocked out in the semis"
dx7ykp5,tnzk01,He celebrated like a mad man because he converted the penalty and bailed his team out. Says right there in your post. Notice how he celebrated last week on his best goal ever? Humble pie. Mentalities are different for winners
dx8btp5,RedDevilNumber1,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NksLn_VUjlIDid I travel back in time? Was this last week, I wish it was"
dx7z7dg,SirMothy,Fuck Michael Oliver and fuck UEFA for not using VAR. Shit like this is bad for the sport
dx80kgi,Dubsified,VAR would have only made this decision easier for Oliver. It was a penalty. Genuinely curious as to why you think VAR would help here?
dx7zwsm,TheStryfe,How would VAR have helped here?
dx8dodx,Lagainsttheworld,VAR would make it a even clearer penalty.
dx7emzo,sacrednumber_108,That wasn't a penalty and should have only been a yellow card for Buffon.
dx7fg08,Styphelus,How was it not a penalty? Clear chance to score and gets pushed from behind.
dx7ftlv,sacrednumber_108,Just a gentle push.
dx7gs6o,Styphelus,"In a goal scoring opportunity. Gentle or not, he pushed him and prevented him from scoring. That's called a penalty."
dx7heqh,sacrednumber_108,He did not push him. Yes there was a contact but he did not push him either with his hands or with his legs. Just a normal contact. Lucas dived.
dx7ir0u,Styphelus,He ran him over. Look at it at normal speed. This video has a good angle of it. http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/the-match/60/post/3450289/cristiano-ronaldos-late-penalty-sees-real-madrid-survive-furious-juventus-rally
dx7fb3e,orionpaper,Classic Ref - Madrid combo. Penaldo offcourse.
dx7gmcv,Facel_Vega,Very soft. Which is why you just don't to call it at *that* moment in the game.
dx7tr00,WardenJack,Most disgusting moment in CL football ever. Only a total wuss would give that penalty but what can you expect from a 33yo english wimp.
dx80385,TheStryfe,So you want the ref to deliberately make wrong calls?
dx7k9ze,New-Object,Last year the refs robbed Bayern; this year Juventus. Only RM fanboys cannot see this but the rest of the World knows...
dx7ktio,nafraf,https://streamable.com/ft51kHOW IS THIS NOT A PENALTY
dx7kihv,spacecreated1234,you can literally see with your own eyes that it's a penalty benatia doesn't even touch the ball

dx7fnwa,ARsenicjuice,"I'm absolutely furious right now. I know I'm drugged up on emotion but this is just blatant injustice. I don't have an issue with the penalty as it's the correct decision but Christ, Oliver. How small do you have to be? You just gave a decisive penalty in the tie, and you can't comprehend that Juventus are understandably going to be upset? Your decision's going to stand, just let the players vent and then get on with it.Sure, I'm for the position that players can't physically/verbally abuse the match officials, but have some fucking tact and critical thinking and basic fucking sympathy. I'm completely with Buffon on this."
dx7h54d,lambomrclago,"The context doesn't matter, a penalty is a penalty. So many people in this thread acting as if you can't give the penalty because of the timing in the game and the circumstance, a foul is a foul and that's all that matters."
dx7h9d9,ARsenicjuice,I'm not disagreeing with you; Oliver made the right call and it was definitely a foul and a penalty. It's the red carding I have an issue with.
dx7wses,lambomrclago,We probably will never know what he said - you'd think Oliver might have a decent idea having reffed for so long with lost of languages. Unfortunate but Ronaldo probably would've scored against Buffon as well. He had a great game until that moment.

dx7epyu,matty0196,"I find this too soft, not enough in it for me but I guess that's how it is nowadays."
dx7eumk,herolurker,"mate the guy is coming from behind and wraps himself around Vasquez, what else do you think its gonna happen?"
dx7f9ne,matty0196,"I just think its sad when all these fucking strong athletes just go down so easily but I don't think my comment came across right. I would like football to be more physical than it is. However, in the current climate it is a pen and the defender is a fool to even try that. I guess I'm one of those awful people who whine about how the physicality has sort of gone from the game, I really need to pack it in."
dx7fguq,herolurker,"While that has changed.But it doesn't change the fact that the defender fucked up, there's nothing he can do, and it even looked like Vazques was not gonna make it, and he gives the penalty away.But, fuck it, there was chance Ronaldo could miss or that the keeper would defend, but they would play extra time 11x10, which again after 90m its almost a death sentence."
dx7fq32,matty0196,"Nah, you are completely right!"
dx7eqku,HailHelix123,Nothing but respect for the ref. He was a hell of a man there
dx7eqlu,DavvaBG,"Unpopular opinion: correct call, Buffon should get suspended for his behavior after getting the card."
dx7eskj,Muslim_Pulisic,"Lmao @ people saying it's not a PK, possibly a red for Benatia too everything considered"
dx7f3kp,seamushoo4,Can't give a pk and a red...
dx7fw1y,Muslim_Pulisic,"Yes you can? Maybe you're thinking about keepers only getting yellows if they try to play the ball, but considering Vasquez was right infront of the goal (i.e. clear goal scoring opportunity) and Benatia clearly fouls him he """"""could"""""" have been sent off, but I guess the ref had some pity. Benatia had a yellow already btw"
dx7etcr,mantistobogan300,Fuck off ronaldo. Right call tho
dx7etsv,fredewio,"What are people mad about??? that was a clear penalty, and Buffon only had himself to blame there."

dx7eujd,pastamonstarasta,Robbed

dx7w0bb,JoeIbanez,I didn't watch the game. Why was that penalty taken 7 minutes after the game was over? What happened?
dx7yf5m,tnzk01,Buffon got sent off after having a go at the ref. They had to bring Woj on. Juve players surrounding the ref and Ronaldo to throw him off.
dx7ec58,jeezijonne,That's not a fucking penalty wtf.

dx7odf7,The_Last_Prince,its not a penalty
dx7r2ed,,[deleted]
dx8fwrp,divinity_hs,"real player is on his knees even before contact... so fucking pathetic dive. Okay, maybe not a dive, but not a penalty."
dx7sd3r,TuneyTune92,https://www.football-italia.net/119796/benatia-it-wasnt-penalty shows a different view. Point is a still image doesn't prove anything. The call was 50/50
dx8as5g,sizzlelikeasnail,Even that image shows it's a penalty. Ffs even making connection with the ball (Which he didn't) doesn't change the fact that you can't kick a players ribs with that forcehttps://streamable.com/ft51kLook how he was sent flying when the kick connected
dx7rpdv,The_Last_Prince,Bro no need to send me a picture i saw the video from different angles an i still believe it was not a penalty .
dx7u2jg,Lagainsttheworld,That's just your bias working. As clear as a penalty can get. You'll get it sometime later.
dx7e8k7,MadridFC,Activate plan C sub R part 7
dx7g2rt,Squeezycakes17,"fuck the ref for sending Buffon off, ridiculous decision"
dx7g88n,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,"not really, he was shoving him and yelling in his face?"
dx7gkvg,Squeezycakes17,"context is important my bro, a strong and decent ref would not have done that"
dx7h3t1,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,What lol
dx7geaj,Louieando,Wouldn't you do the same to a stupid decision like that?
dx7ghng,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,but it was a pen? lol
dx7grlp,Louieando,Clear as day it was not
dx7h1d2,ljsdfsfsdfsdf,"okay bro, you believe that lol"
dx7hsb0,Unculturedswine55,What i hate is that any physicality in football is punished now. Never a pen if the cunt doesnt dive
dx7hwlz,,"Benatia gave the ref a choice. No matter how 'soft' the penalty was, that was just stupid. Especially in the 93rd minute of the game."
dx7n88w,pinchcrimp,Man I really fucking hate Ronaldo.
dx7e8f4,SkumbagGrunny,HOLY SHIT
dx7ect5,,[deleted]
dx7esnz,Elgin_McQueen,"Maybe that's what the ref gave, the announcers don't know. I'd maybe have said it was both though."
dx7ed0v,Fara940527,Why did Buffon get the red if he never made a foul? Sorry I'm not seeing it? Was it what happened after the foul??Edit: thanks everyone for clarifying. Doesn't show Buffon pushing the ref in the clip hence the confusion!
dx7ekef,sarefx,He charged at Oliver and give him few pushes from behind.
dx7eu5c,tnzk01,He pushed the ref after the call was made. He really lost his head.
dx7eve1,Elgin_McQueen,Yeah for after the foul.
dx7ffk5,KevinK89,Of course it was because what happened after the foul.
dx7ed8g,mattgoody99,Scum
dx7edpe,teagwo,UEFADRID
dx7edpo,Poomandu1,Disgraceful
dx7eevz,chimaloo,"Disgrace of the century, Penaldo and UEFA-Madrid do it again"
dx7ef29,jrey0707,absolutely horrible way to decide a uefa quarter final.
dx7ef8g,mortizauge,Uefadrid
dx7efhl,AssuredlyAThrowAway,Ref played far too big of a role there. Shameful and a disgrace.
dx7efmx,-TheOldLady-,Biggest load of bullshit I've had to sit through in a long time. What a fucking waste of a good football match. A damn shame
dx7egs5,Tadamo7,"Real Madrid slipping uefa that couple million now. Edit: definitely shouldn't comment straight after a game again, bloody hell I needed to calm down. Not deleting this so I can remind myself not to be an arse after a football game."
dx7egu7,jadenyuki21,"Real being helped by the ref. hmm, i've seen this before"
dx7elnb,EddieBravosBong,HE DOESN'T WILT. HE DOESN'T GIVE UP. HE DOESN'T PANIC.GREATEST. OF. ALL. TIME.
dx7es2b,grendel_loki,I CAN'T BREATHE
dx7fgaa,Milimetar,What a bunch of horseshit.
dx7fgjj,red-helsing,Hala uefadrid.. 😏
dx7h0zd,zefo_dias,Couldn't think of a better end to this game.
dx7la12,DPinder92,0 saves in a ucl qf. Good to see szezny hasnt improved! 😂
dx7mpli,Amusebeard,"It's not a pen. It looks like it in slow mo, but the contact was not harsh enough to be a pen."
dx7mrhd,Flacko115,Plus Vasquez is already on his way down. Harsh call imo especially in the last 30 seconds of a huge game
dx7p8k1,ggggal,How does it matter which minute is it and how many seconds are left to play? Is it a penalty in 33rd minute and not in 93rd ? Lol
dx7qbg8,Flacko115,"I think that time does dictate whether different fouls should be called, yeah. Any avid football fan would say the same. To put it more simply, you'd be upset if that was called on you guys, especially in that spot"
dx7qx7g,ggggal,"Why do u think that? Foul in a foul, match is played 90min, u are saying if last 5min of the game should be without rules"
dx7rfuu,Flacko115,Never said that. Of course fouls should be called in the last 5 minutes. That was a pretty soft call foul though as Vasquez was always looking for the call so the ref should've been more lenient. Pretty harsh to let that decide a game in which the winning team did not deserve to win
dx7rz01,ggggal,"He was looking for a goal and its only benatias fault that penalty was called, only he could have prevented it."
dx7tldt,Flacko115,"Wasn't looking for a goal at all, never makes an attempt to kick the ball. Vasquez was falling from the start"
dx7op4h,hotpants69,They should have blown the whistle look at the time 93:00 after plus 3 added... Foul occurs at 93:02 shame
dx7tf5x,Rarehero,"The extra time is not binding. While refs are expected to respect the suggested extra time, they are free to extend it, and they are supposed to let a dangerous attack play out. If Benatia had cleared the ball, it'd been over a second later."
dx7ucbh,hotpants69,But then why didn't they add another 3 minutes for all the time wasting
dx7v05s,Rarehero,"The set piece has to happen, and if takes 20 minutes to calm things down and play the set piece. That's the rule. And the ref decides if he wants to add time wasting during extra time to the total game time. Since the time wasting was caused intentionally or by bad behavior, he did not add it to the play time, which is the usual behavior.By the way, suggested extra time in the WOrld Cup final was two minutes. The total time was almost 94 minutes, with a free kick from Messi that started before the suggested extra time was over, and that was executed in the 93th minute. American soccer might do things differently, inspired by the other big American team sports, but this is not the standard in Europe."
dx7w7b2,hotpants69,Yeah I was unhappy about that one too. I think the whistle should be like hockey
dx7x6vf,Rarehero,"Hockey is a lot faster though. So is basketball. Football/soccer is more compareable with American Football, and what are the rules for this in American Football? The attacking team can complete their one last attack or field goal attempt even if the times run out, right?It is very similar in football. The attacking team can usually complete their attack if they do it quick, and set pieces are executed even when the extra time is up. Football is more ""fluent"" though and the play can go from one side to the other without interruption, while in American Football the match is over when the time is over and the final drive or field goal attempt was played."
dx7pqsk,WatchTheGood,Because you blow the whistle while there is a cross from a dangerous position??
dx7ubfm,hotpants69,Nah but that's what happened this isn't ea FIFA. And yeah times up
dx8k3ph,petorius,It means a minimum of 3 added minutes. It can be anywhere between 3 and 4 minutes plus any time added on from the time they announce it.
dx7ebxe,Pontus_Pilates,"Well, the ref wanted to give the softest penalty possible. Mission accomplished."
dx7f8fv,DavyH5,Lol it was clearly a pen
dx7ecdo,Freysey,Spain saved by the refs.
dx7edda,neLendirekt,THIS IS NUMBER ONE BULLSHIT.
dx7edjs,Crazed8s,Why even play if there gonna gift it to Ronaldo?
dx7efcd,minidivine,That was bogus.
dx7erd7,archjones,PenaldoAmirite?
dx7e89r,SleepingWithx,CRISTIANO RONALDO!!!
dx7eok7,ShadowDandy,Penaldo*
dx7k7x8,M0NETY,The hypocrisy in this sub is comical. Last season Suarez leg is clipped from behind but it's “a disgrace”. But this is a “clear cut penalty”.
dx84m31,BrianDawkins,Penaldo gets a gift yet again. Can't write this shit
dx87bl1,juancorleone,"What are you 12? Anyone who uses Penaldo to describe Ronaldo is clearly a Messi fanboy or hates Ronaldo. The guy literally scores all kinds of goals , but how dare he score the penalty which his team was rightly awarded"
dx7eb71,Fort_When_Tea,RIGGED
dx7ec9m,Rainy778,Cheats.
dx7eci3,stingen,Didn't even look like a foul to me.
dx7edog,persianbird9,That was BS... Cannot believe Real Madrid got a get out of jail PK like that!
dx7edyj,yesnomaybe01,Terrible decision from Oliver. Never a pen.. Madrid have been diving all night.
dx7efku,JimmyJamesincorp,Fuck this cheater team. In my mind this one won't count for real if they win it.
dx7ej6e,,[removed]
dx7f6pa,JJaysNotHome,Grow up
dx7filx,DavyH5,For making the right call?
dx7fmem,ProtonVolcano,Blow me
dx7gflg,DavyH5,Lol salty
dx7ffkc,nervaickarma,"No way that's a penalty, Lucas doesn't even attempt to play the ball. Couldn't wait to fall down and once Benatia touched him he was going down. Benatia went around, horrible call."
dx7ecet,throwaway987747472,Fuck Penaldo
dx7mh65,joeykittens,Weak mentality.
dx7opn8,flavianpatrao,Cause coming from 3-0 down to where they were is weak? What a joke
dx7vp0d,joeykittens,Don't act like cunts and you won't be treated like one. Shout out to chiellini
dx7s06b,Bladewing10,Why's he taking his shirt off? He's about to lose
dx804az,TheStryfe,He just won it
dx8gehr,bslawjen,Real are through and Juve are out bruh.
dx7gn5k,NikolaR10,My hair has fallen off reading comments from United States fanboys ....YOU DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT A PENALNTY IS ...IT WAS CLEARLY NOT A PENALNTY!!!and even if it was penalty...you can't give a damn PENALNTY on the 93 mark and also not showing RESPECT to BUFFON by showing him a red card ...What a tiny brained Referee...
dx7gqgp,Faizan24839,Clear shove in a goal scoring opportunity. Penalty. Buffon shoved and screamed at the ref. Clear red. Both the right decisions regardless of the circumstances.
dx7h4la,NikolaR10,What SHOVE? He barely touched him and he fell like he was shot with a Sniper from behind ....Even if he yelled at the ref he has the right to do it...He is the captain and also players like this you have to think twice giving red card ...But maybe you don't know anything about Football Culture
dx7h9kl,Faizan24839,"The game deserved a better ending, I agree. But honestly, that was a clear penalty, he clearly shoves him, and in a position like that, it's a penalty, I'm sorry but that's the rules. And yes resistance is expected when you give that call, but no player has the right to get all aggressive like that."
dx7h8p6,halfelven23,why the fuck you need to show respect against that kind of attitude dude?
dx7kqoa,NikolaR10,What kind of attitude it was ? Isn't he supposed to defend his team and moreover when you are shown injustice like that you think you would remained calm? Referee has to understand the circumstances ...he can't just have wahtever decision he has in mind without response from either part its not dictatorship....
dx7h0at,Yieldway17,Your sarcasm attempt is not being detected well.
dx7i94n,RibenaKid,Alternative title: Buffon did a Zidane and then Ronaldo penaldoed.
dx7irih,javk5pakfa,Ronaldo did his job: scoring when chances present.
dx7knea,RibenaKid,"Absolutely. I didn't mean this as a jab at him, quite the opposite. I don't know many players who can take this kick with as much confidence."
dx7lghw,javk5pakfa,Lol I feel like you using the noun Penaldo didn't fit your intention :P
dx7sqsj,RibenaKid,"Like Kitnado pointed out, it's no longer a diss at this point :)https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8bkfcn/post_match_thread_real_madrid_13_43_agg_juventus/dx7hso1"
dx7gbeo,GL4389,[Controversial Opinion] But that was not a Red Card.
dx7gcwb,DavyH5,Why not? He's screaming in the refs face and pushing him around.
dx7gfbg,Y4nn1c,you don't know what he said
dx8bf4k,TheElite3740,Never a pen. Disgusting fascist club.
dx8cwfu,Siralosmdk,Te falta cantar eso de 'i inda indapandansia'
dx8ez1o,TheElite3740,shut up
dx8h3pg,Siralosmdk,Al carrer en cuartos (otra vez)
dx7ec86,Jacques_Le_Chien,Not a fair call
dx7eb3j,adamfrog,"no more contact in that than ronaldo did 3 seconds earlier, ref got it wrong"

dx7efub,KiimainenKameli,Bullshit call. Lucky cunts.
dx7egmf,ShadowDandy,You cannot win even wirh 3 goals up without penalties?

dx7fu1v,ShadowDandy,They loose fairly at least
dx7ejwj,Growlithe123,Barcelona wasn't lucky enough to have a bullshit call like that
dx7ebqm,Stramanor,Ref helping real to another semi-final 😭😭😭
dx7ekr5,smallboss98,nope
dx7ejo6,Revanxv,"Spanish team and getting bailed out by the ref, name the better duo."
