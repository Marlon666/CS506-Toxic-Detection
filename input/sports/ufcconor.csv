dwwzd8n,Frostyvoice,But what's his weight?
dwx06xs,jeric13xd,155.1 Edit: just got word that he's 155.0 after that walk to the cop car
dwx0ek1,_Trigglypuff_,Dana sent a blank check to meet his bail.
dwxgepc,ARRRBEEE,Conor may be the best troll of all-time. He legit had the deputies in booking at jail enter his weight as 155 lbs. See for yourself:https://twitter.com/Th3Micktorious/status/982289032020414464LOL

dwxrg3z,_Griggs_,Hahahahahaha
dwygljt,ultimate_n0,">is this person not proficient in English Why not just say “Is this person proficient in English? It seems like really vague wording to me. Maybe the government is trying to cover up some incidents that occurred when arresting non-proficient English speakers just like they covered up the moon landing and 9/11. Look it up, that's all I'm saying. Watch the YouTube videos. #lookitup"

dwxwj6j,iBrowze,It also says: Proficient in English: No
dwxwzvn,xKiller_Dx,"They use a weird choice of grammar there and it creates a double negative. It says ""Is the person not proficient in English: No"" meaning he is proficient."
dwy2nrb,iBrowze,Oh my bad. I misread it then.
dwy3kwv,ArthurGainness,Not proficient in English: Yes
dwxi8rh,seitung,No fookin' accent!
dwxxcsc,McTitties420420,"Imagine fucking up as hard as he did yesterday, but still having the presence of mind to say you weigh 155 even when the police ask.I'm upset he hurt other fighters, and think he handled himself like an entitled ass. You don't throw a dolly through a bus window period, but you *especially* don't throw a dolly through a bus window **when you have no idea who is in the bus**. He could have killed someone. Just imagine if the dolly hadn't hit the space in between the windows. Imagine if it flew straight through, and the dolly itself cracked someone with a smaller stature like Rose or Borg in the head. There could have been serious, serious injuries. What an absolute dick move. But...The guy is still one clever motherfucker."

dwxhz95,chrisnmarie,Birthday is wrong
dwxhyto,definitelymyrealname,The cops don't weigh you when they book you. They just take the weight off your drivers license or ID. Who knows how long ago he filled out the info for the ID.
dwxt9i9,ChrisMelb,Most countries don't have weight on your ID or licence anyway.
dwyeub0,definitelymyrealname,Really? Odd.
dwxqvau,MuscleGoat,"I got weighed in before and after the cavity search. Hmm, maybe your cops are just lazy. Don't give a fuck about the validity of an official state document that decribes the citizen's weight."

dwxvkho,Original_Cliche,"is there a reason it reads ""Is this person not proficient in English?"" The only questions that is about language proficiency results in a double negative where everything else does not."
dwycnll,ediks,"Orrrr, just got it off his drivers license? That is normally what they do."
dwydcjt,Jaded_and_Faded,whats the significance of this? I get that is the weight limit for his division but why is it a troll move to be listed at that? Does it mean he did a weight cut as if he was going to step in to fight?
dwy6ad0,BiteOfTheJames,"Is this person proficient in English: NOEdit: oh fuck, I'm the idiot that's not proficient. I didn't not not catch the double negative."

dwy3be0,xxsilence,"""...**not** proficient in english"" So a no means he is proficient. It's weirdly worded."
dwy5e3y,pdxfoodeatingperson,You're right. I'll leave my comment up in shame.
dwxnx0x,PM_ME_UR_SECERTS,Ufc is getting alot of bad media attention for this. I doubt Dana will do anything for Connor now.
dwx6rmu,iTzNiKo,"Yo if he's actually sitting at 155 rn, it wouldn't surprise me if Dana set this all up to have Khabib and Conor fight. All the controversy would sell the shit outta this fight."
dwxfdis,vnw_rm,"I doubt Dana set it all up, however I wouldn't put it past him to try to capitalize on this. He keeps saying shit like ""this is way past firing, this is criminal,"" which gives me the feeling he's not going to fire him and is trying to save face for the moment. Then when Connor doesn't get thrown in jail he'll get his big fight with Khabib and Dana will be able to say something like ""well the law has done its part and they've determined Connor doesn't have to go to jail. These two can settle their differences in the the ring now."""
dwxlh0x,Boltslakersdodgers,As a business man he should absolutely capitalize on this
dwxrzom,IrnBroski,"i mean, that is the perfect word for this situation.*capital*ize."
dwxwpi6,I_Think_I_Cant,CAPITALize.
dwxxeu6,IrnBroski,"fuck, you win."
dwxpvzj,AndrewWaldron,"As a non-fan, this is this kind of stuff that pulls us in. Not doing this would be a business blunder of the first order."
dx0sph3,tkdn2,Even more so when he is in show business
dwxp5b7,WeirdEraCont,He set it up
dwxv7js,demetrios3,You think Conor McGregor agreed to get arrested and a criminal record just to help Dana promote a fight?
dwxm27e,Scootmcpoot,If it's included in the embedded it's absolutely a business move. Has nothing to do with fighters but use it to sell the ppv.
dwxpivp,NealHandleman,"> which gives me the feeling he's not going to fire him and is trying to save face for the moment.which doesn't make any sense. it seems like a clear to deflection to avoid firing when he knows he should. I mean if its so far beyond firing than it should be a given that he's automatically fired right? >""well the law has done its part and they've determined Connor doesn't have to go to jail. These two can settle their differences in the the ring now.""I'm pretty sure mgregor violated whatever agreement he has with them. he should be fired and the only reason he's not is cause dana wants to make money off of him."
dwxo596,jquest12,Oh Bellator is frothing at the mouth for Dana to do something stupid like cut Connor
dwxptcs,Sc0tty2hotty,yeah he can go to bellator and not fight there too
dwxoi3q,Scootmcpoot,They couldn't beg him enough. At the end of the day conor wants to fight the best guys.
dwy05tr,Intanetspexialist,"Lol, as if"
dwy077h,Scootmcpoot,He stayed in cagewarriors?
dwxstdh,higuita1,Someone remember this comment so it becomes a bestof later.

dwynicb,Myles-Davis,"Save this comment so when this happens, exactly like you described, you can feel very good about yourself."
dwzieu2,Folsomdsf,">Then when Connor doesn't get thrown in jail He's already been thrown in jail. You're talking about sentencing, not jail. You wait in jail while accused(if you don't bail out), you are sentenced to jail for under a year and prison for over a year later."

dwxlv5t,poopsicle88,"Damn you're clouding the waters don't confuse this for me!! I don't think Dana is that pr savvy, I think connor is. But people got hurt so I think either the beef was real (in which case khabib kinda got chumped imo) or it was a stunt that got out of hand. Or chiesa is faking?!!! Dude cmon He's saving those pics for his court case I wonder how much he will get"
dwxqm8x,dadeblunts,Whats more likely. Some conspiracy or tribalism
dwxv6um,MsSoompi,Didn't thug rose start blubbering?
dwy4og1,woht24,Look into what.. The lack of photo?
dwxb4wq,fakeyero,"That doesn't discount that it could have been planned. Conor may have gone too far with it and hurt people he shouldn't have, but those things can both be true."
dwxyhtb,2BigBottlesOfWater,Yeah I heard Namajunas is legit pissed about it all
dwxeco9,BreeWyatt,"according to Ariel he received zero stitches and was the lowest ranked fighter on the bus that Conor ""attacked""."
dwxlf2u,Tyko_3,"How bad where they hurt? If I where a fighter and the promoter gave me a check to take a chairshot to the head or something similar so that the eventual fight would draw more I'd be ok with it. I mean, Fighters get hit for a living... Hey all this sounds strangely familiar somehow..."
dwx829j,Counterkulture,"If he's close to 155, I'd be a lot more suspicious."
dwx86k0,NextTimeDHubert,He has so much lawsuit leverage over Conor now a near-term UFC fight is guaranteed.
dwxao5x,BigDaddy-69,No way. A Conor/Khabib superfight would have its own ridiculous promo to drive PPV sales. This shitshow probably got a lot of people to cancel their PPV.
dwxlfx5,I_CAN_SMELL_U,"No way, this country loves this shit. Hell Ireland does even more, this would drive up sales."

dwxxj6f,sagradia,"In my opinion, that would be rewarding bad behavior and sending the wrong message. Athletes should be scared to lose their livelihood by acting dumb, not rewarded for it."
dwxz0bm,eastcoastgamer,"If you think this was all planned, you're more silly than the frame of mind Connor was in when he did this. Even before the UFC was huge, Dana was against bullying and this type of behavior."
dwygm83,MikeOx_Girthy,April fools
dwxbqhv,An0therk,He'd surely fail any drug test. The lad has more white powder in him than a beanbag
dwxeua4,entheogeneric,But those have beans in them..
dwxbf6x,Light-Hammer,Artem looked too scared when Khabib confronted him for this to be a work.Conor got coked up and came to defend his rusifu.
dwxgs3k,HaHaWalaTada,Agreed. This is too much manufactured drama for a sport that actually settles things with a fight. This was when keeping it fake goes wrong..
dwx3uez,Nome_de_utilizador,Make the walk to the cage straight from the police car and let khabib murder him
dwxa6au,TearShitDown,"""you think Im just gonna sit here and let you kill me Khabib?"""
dwx5cx2,manubfr,It's Towelgate all over again!

dwy85fo,CurtisJaxon,"This is a really common criticism of that song.I think we all felt that way upon listening. I did hear another interpretation of that line on reddit somewhere that was actually a tad interesting...Basically they suggest that Logic was using the line sarcastically (intentionally making it an out of place line) as a nod to this weird culture we've created around discussing serious mental illness like depression, anxiety, and OCD like they are every day trivialities. So it's like a sarcastic cry of ""ya I'm depressed who can relate? Wooo"" ugh... I wanna die, ""same"" omg I'm so ocd.... etc.. etc..No clue if he was going for that with the line but I thought it was an interesting take regardless."

dwxv95r,dispatch134711,Mmmm isn't Matt Hughes kind of more like a piece of shit as referenced in his own autobiography?
dwxvmjn,SirCharlesEquine,This stuff being said about predates the book. Hughes was regularly called a cocky asshole simply for being blunt and saying an opponent had a weakness. It was ridiculous.

dwxn43i,DuelingPushkin,I know. I was just ignoring it for the humor since things like ATM Machine and CAC Card make me chuckle.
dwx2n7z,findingnemoo,Yeah Rogan loves to say this about Jones and it's annoying. Like you don't need to be a jackass to be a GOAT/Champ.
dwxk3oc,iamtomorrowman,"you do need to have singular drive to the exclusion of almost everything else being important to you, to be the best/GOAT for many years. Michael Jordan sucker punched one of his teammates in practice, but it is what it is."

dwxc7mp,I_m_High,I dunno the most talented athletes I've known have all been psychopaths. Some just do a better job of keeping it together and building a public persona. One of my college teammates punched his own fucking mother and you can still watch that dude play every Sunday during the fall

dwx0l55,TheyCallHimPaul,I think Schaub should step in for Pettis and fight Khabib. I'd like to see Khabib make him fight ghosts again
dwx0mdc,Jolmer24,Rogan has been trying to condition the narrative to bring Jon Jones back two times now. I wouldnt be surprised if he a least attempts to lighten the blow to Conor here.
dwx18ja,TheyCallHimPaul,"Well let me just preface this by saying I'm definitely not Pro-Bones and haven't been for a long time. But I have to say, this shit is worse than Bones. Yes, Jon is a piece of shit person. I personally believe he has cheated in the past, and there's no getting around the fact that he almost killed that pregnant lady in the accident. But that's exactly what that was, an accident. Caused by his own negligence, yes, but an accident. For that to be on par with what Connor did, he would have had to swerve to purposely hit that lady. Because Connor's actions were premeditated with the intent to hurt people. And not only hurt people, but hurt athletes. Hurt his COLLEAGUES. Connor could have ended multiple careers with that shit he pulled. This is definitely another level than Jones."
dwx5f0h,NPE37,Jones intentionally left the scene of a car crash. He never checked on the victim or called an ambulance. That was an intentional decision and in my opinion far more dangerous than what Conor did. That's not even getting into the fact that Jones intentionally decided to drive his vehicle intoxicated not caring that he could legit kill people through his actions.
dwx31l5,blahbotblahblah,Yeah it was just an innocent accident. Just like the first accident in NY.That Bones Jones is so accident prone when he drives under the influence. Such a loveable klutz.
dwx35f9,TheyCallHimPaul,"Like I said, completely his fault. But he didn't do it with the intent of injuring people he's just a fucking idiot"
dwx3ou3,blahbotblahblah,"He intentionally created a dangerous situation that could kill innocent bystanders, and nearly did. Twice."
dwx42t0,TheyCallHimPaul,I guess just agree to disagree then. I agree that Jones is shit and there's no way in Hell he should be allowed back into the UFC. But neither should McNuggits
dwx701k,Forumbane,I just imagined a future where Bellator becomes bigger than the UFC of the back of it's 2 new superstar signings - Jones and Conor. (they give him a new 165lb title shot first up)
dwx7hi9,TheyCallHimPaul,And a special undercard fight with Mike Goldberg vs Big John
dwx685z,dork_of_the_isles,"nothing will be worse than jones hitting a pregnant woman, running, returning for no other reason than to get his drugs and cash, then leaving again"
dwx7b5f,TheyCallHimPaul,"I guess what I'm trying to say that in terms of future fighting career and in the eyes of the UFC, Conor is in a worse position"
dwx9loz,weedavysoup,No.
dwxil2l,SixStringerSoldier,"Jones fleeing the scene while intoxicated wasn't an accident.He hit a PREGNANT WOMAN with a fucking car, and decided to run away instead if helping."
dwxru6z,CaptainAirstripOne,"That's true but it was even worse - he ran away, ran back to get drugs and money he'd left in the car, then ran away again."

dwx2ahq,TheyCallHimPaul,"Apologies, I'm all 6's and 7's today"
dwyuj11,Feedbackr,Imagine if the thrown dolley didn't get stopped by the frame of the bus and instead went clean through the window. Highly probable. That would have caused serious fucking injury.
dwx1i82,Jolmer24,It is worse than Jon for sure but I was getting the impression that the Brendan/Joe Hype train for McGregor was to even more levels of Goof Hype than for Jones.
dwx1nss,TheyCallHimPaul,"Oh i definitely agree with that. And plus Dana's obsession with him. But man it seems like for the first time ever, Conor has made more blood go to Dana's head than his dick. No one will be backing Conor with this shit"
dwx1u1p,Jolmer24,"Its not a good combo I think. Hes held up a competitive division for over a year. Hes acting like he can control the organization. Hes had his antics with the Diaz presser, the Bellator slap, and now this. Theres a lot of die hard just bleed UFC fans who will excuse this shit, and I am sure wed all watch Khabib v. McGregor at this point if they did it but to new fans or outsiders this looks fucking awful and might turn some people away from the sport. That has to be running through Dana and the owners minds more than anything. You have to consider the future growth of the sport not just the present bad blood PPV points."
dwx21gu,TheyCallHimPaul,"But that's exactly the point. Dana already fucked up with all the chances he gave Jones. If he's looking to keep the integrity and longevity in the sport, he needs to ban Conor. How would it look for the UFC if they showed that you can do whatever the fuck you want and still make a fuckload of money."
dwx2o4t,Jolmer24,"Im not sure whos downvoting you. I dont entirely disagree but we know they wont ban Conor. With enough distance they are going to try and do this Khabib v. Conor fight now. I think what bothers me most is that they basically let him run the show. They cant let any individual become bigger than the organization. Its important that theres some consistency in how they do things. I think theres a good middle ground between what they are doing right now with all these interim belts and nonsensical title shots, and a more tame linear way to the belt."

dwy0r69,CubonesDeadMom,"Joe Rogan is not going to praise him for this, idk about Shaub though. He might laugh about it but that's not the same thing"
dwzegr3,achilles165,"Schaub will most likely hop on his dick pretty soon, but I always got the feeling that Rogan low isn't too fond of Conor."
dwx19oi,ergoegthatis,I don't think you know Rogan all that well. He doesn't support this nonsense.
dwx0ehz,melihs11,"Schaub already did in a video on twitter. i mean he didn't condone what Mcgregor did, but he did say something that i can't remember about defending McGregor"
dwx0jnu,Jolmer24,Im waiting with bated breath. I have been able to give those two a pass on a lot of this silly shit because they get caught up in the hype but this is legit inexcusable horse shit. I really REALLY hope they have some perspective on it.

dwx57wm,BlackCatsAreMagic,"Who said anything about barring people from employment, you illiterate fuck?"

dwx68us,BlackCatsAreMagic,"If someone doesn't want to be labeled an illiterate fuck, they should learn to read. Not a single person suggested barring people from employment."
dwxb2hk,WolfgangvonWolfhaus,"Ariel tweeted:""An NYPD source said that McGregor has been cooperative. He has a lot of fans on the force. One told me McGregor was seen shadowboxing as he was awaiting his arraignment."""
dwxqgmv,TheRadBomber,Never has a champ with less title defenses as Conor established himself as such a legend.
dwxu0ek,SplitFigure,"His meteoric rise through the rankings, charisma, and business/media sense established his legendary status long before the lack of title defenses came into play."
dwxujy1,Johnnyinthesun1,He literally started a documentary about himself before he joined UFC. This guy is the real deal
dwyieqr,TheRadBomber,For some. I'm an old school fan and used to get downvoted for saying the UFC gave him a favorable ride to the belts and I stand by that. But even not being a Conor fan I've enjoyed the entire shit show and followed every moment of it. Shadow boxing in jail while UFC 223 crumbles is just a fucking brilliant gotta give him props.
dwyis7c,SplitFigure,I think the UFC just used the shine he brought as best as they could (who could blame them?). What really got me to like him was my respect for his skill in the cage and how much of a true master he is with publicity. The man transcended the sport and people will never be able to talk about the history of MMA without mentioning him.(Wasn't a fan of his until around the 2nd Diaz fight. He crushed my soul with Aldo.)
dwyjkpr,TheRadBomber,"Thing with talking this around here is people getting almost militant in their defense over Conor. I think he's a great striker but the UFC gave him such a favorable ride to the belts. Conor was getting a shot after fighting Siver and Poirier was his only top 5 opponent prior to Mendes who was a if I recall right. Then he got the shot at 155 without having a single fight a that weight in the UFC where other champs in the past like with Anderson Silva didn't get that. Conor earned his belts, him and the UFC used each other. But I don't think he's earned his legend status as a fighter without defending a belt. But I can't say he's all talk cause obviously he's not. It's weird but I sum it up as his mouth has earned him more than his fists in a way and it bothers me."
dwylbnn,SplitFigure,"Fair enough. I can understand your perspective. I doubted Conor's abilities time and time again specifically because of how fast he was propelled through tiers of opponents. ""He hasn't been tested by XYZ""....I do think the shot at 155 is more to do with the changing climate of the UFC (business and big fights first) and the timing of Conor's rise. I think if the UFC was where they're at now when Silva exploded, things would have been different. Then again, Silva doesn't have the same presence outside the cage as Conor, which brings us back to your original point."
dx266cu,artem2018champ,"You are being unfair. First I agree that Conor isn't a legend in terms of his resume. But he is very close and if he knocks khabib and ferguson out, he gets there.I highly disagree with you that his mouth earned him more than his fist. Literally everyone including Conor haters will say that Conor is exciting as hell to watch. It's because his striking is arguably the best in the ufc and he knocks people out. His featherweight run is legendary and will not be matched in a long time, if not ever. 6 1st/2nd round KO and 1 dominant victory and the 13 second KO of the p4p #1 GOAT who was a champ for 10 years. That's the fucking fist talking right there."
dwy2vu3,Heknarf,"He got choked out by a gatekeeper who took the fight on like 10 days fucking notice. I have no idea how he survived that. On top of that, his redemption against that embarrassing loss was a fucking decision.."
dwy6ye4,HokemPokem,And then he battered him in the rematch. Your point? Strike that. I know what your point is and I don't care to waste my time with it.
dwy1idn,post_button_account,Bobby Fischer had 0 title defenses. Many still rate him as the greatest chess player ever.
dwzitbw,Folsomdsf,"Here's the thing, at the time bobby fischer had actually already defeated the people there WOULD be a title defense against. He also beat them in MULTIPLE types of chess. Standard, Blitz, etc. It's like if McGregor could also win a kickboxing championship, a boxing championship, and an MMA championship in the same year. Oh and Fischer vacated his title after FIDE voted against his wanted match. And the person who he was scheduled to play.. again.. he had beaten already in a long form. Oh and that person? He also played them 20 years later and mangled them.that and chess has tournaments, not so much just a world title floating around."
dwzk7w2,post_button_account,I mean I am not arguing against. I am just responding to the title defenses point. Also if we are shit talking....Fischer ducked Karpov.
dx02m8h,Folsomdsf,">Fischer ducked Karpov.Ehh they played informal matches more than once and you can argue either way but I don't think Karpov would win the 75 world championship. The problem was the current champion despite being probably one of the greatest players of all time was also very mentally ill so we'll never know. If they had played in 75, I give the wing hands down to fischer as Karpov wasn't quite Karpov at the time. Look at how he played in 78 for instance, he fell apart."
dx02wdh,post_button_account,Meh. I dont think Karpov would have beaten Fischer either. But this is why title defenses are important. So that people dont question your legacy later. Though I guess Fischer had a good excuse. He was cuckoo.
dx04ky1,Folsomdsf,"Yah, around 72-73 he went from 'stable but a bit out there' to full on batshit insane. and /r/mma where we come to discuss fucking chess ;)"
dwzka6f,TheRadBomber,Nobody would be getting giddy over Bobby Fischer playing shadow chess in his cell
dwxuioy,BlackHamTown,>meets weight >holloway out>marketable story of beef between conor and khab>seen shadow boxinghow is this not 4d chess for dana to have him be a surprise fighter in 223.

dwxss5s,MrArtless,"This is probably CTE. A lot of pro football players and boxers become violent and crazy, it literally isn't their fault."
dwybrcq,itzfritz,"I get the 'C' (cocaine), but what do the 'T' and the 'E' stand for? :)"
dwxxtg9,OneADayFlintstones,"Regardless, people got hurt."
dwxwhdo,Gnash_D_Lord,"I would say throwing a chair through a bus window is quite literally your fault.I get where you are coming from with CTE. But actions need to have consequences CTE or not. The only difference here is the person is a multi-millionaire A list athlete.If this was a sub-par college student no one has heard of the NYPD would be having a field day, as they do."
dwxt7s4,lemon_battery,"Then put them in an asylum. If it's ""not their fault"" then they belong in an asylum for the rest of their life."
dwxtif4,MrArtless,You sound like you don't understand how common this is. A preposterous amount of football players and fighters end up with domestic violence charges. My friend played for the Cardinals for like 2 seasons and he occasionally has CTE fits where he goes crazy for a short period of time and becomes violent. He doesn't mean it afterward but he does harm to people. Mike Tyson and Mayweather deserve to be in an asylum for the rest of their lives?
dwxty32,lemon_battery,I would say most professional players suffer from lack of discipline more than anything. Anyway regarding your friend. Why should it matter if he means to hurt other people? If he still does it. We have the insanity defence for a reason.
dwxucyu,MrArtless,"The insanity defense is really hard to argue successfully, it's basically only for people who are raving lunatics 24/7. It matters because he's a really really nice guy, not violent by nature, but he freaks out sometimes. You'd have to see it.The research clearly indicates that the types of injuries these athletes receive do untold amounts of brain damage that we don't really have the ability to measure at the moment. The most common symptoms include violence. It's not unreasonable to say McGregor is fucked in the head by now and deserves some understanding."
dwxufi5,lemon_battery,Is your friend on any medications?
dwxuujr,MrArtless,I'm not sure I haven't seen him in a couple years. He was on mood stabilizers of some kind but we never talked about it much.
dwy17sb,mightyboognish32,Professional athletes are some of the most disciplined people out there.
dwyqard,Lymphoshite,Only in regards to their training.
dwyrgf3,mightyboognish32,Professional athletes are less prone to being criminals than non athletes.
dwys00t,Lymphoshite,Which is completely irrelevant to what I just said.

dwxwotg,,"Alright, I can't reason with someone who refuses to acknowledge the positive attributes Connor showed in this situation, like sticking up for his friend and being cool with the NYPD. If you're only going to acknowledge negative things of course you will only have a negative perception."

dwxsvz5,,"Can you tell me what I said that's not true? It isn't just for kids adults follow the rule too. No one who does what everyone else does and follows all social norms ever inspires real loyalty or devotion, or is remembered in history for that matter. Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, those guys weren't squares who acted nice and followed the rules all the time."
dwxt343,Swaggifornia,"If you really think Conor mcgregor launching a dolly at a bus window and injuring 3 people, none of them being the guy he was actually mad at, being an individual who breaks from social norms and marches to the beat of his own drum, rather than a cokehead who keeps proclaiming he's the best while not defending his title and in general an asshole, I don't know what to say."
dwxtyan,,You don't understand the appeal humans have for the duality of man. The fact that he flew 2 thousand miles to defend his buddy violently and is having a good time with cops appeals to people because it relates to both the good and bad in them. They excuse the bad because the good trumps the bad. Some people think more deeply than “hurrr dur Connor hurt somebody he's bad”.
dwxuoig,samwri25,"I don't like Connor or what he did, but I do get what your saying, he appeals to people, he's charismatic, he's exciting, he's different. And I'd probably like Connor if it wasn't for shit like this"

Is that some kind of code for ""Im going to ignore how much of a piece of shit this guy is because I think he's cool""?Yeah take some pictures with cops, really fixes up the people he hurt. Really excuses him. He is redeemed. Not to mention his buddy's fighting career is over, good job he did for him. But I guess the meathead cops can relate to a criminal who will probably escape justice, just like some of them."

dwyecel,Daemonicus,"> Depends on which celebrities, and the reasons behind doing so.Yeah, not quite.

You express enthusiasm for the latter to people you do and do not know, so what's wrong with doing the same for the former?I happen to admire McGregor. He is an icon. He knows what he's about and what he stands for. He's got grit. He's got skill. He's got dedication. He's intelligent. He's a decent human being (despite his purposeful public facade) and a badass.

And the only way to do that is with through Nielsen PPM meters. But please, continue to explain (incorrectly btw) how I'm wrong."
dwx851f,BlackCatsAreMagic,Are you streaming through the UFC's website or a third party illegal stream?
dwx8i46,ablackguy22,i done said bout 50 times im watching a free stream lol. i said im not paying for the ppv.
dwx8pbc,BlackCatsAreMagic,"""Me seeing an ad does absolutely nothing if the UFC can't prove that I saw the ad."" is what you just posted. Either your purposefully muddying your responses so nobody can prove any specific thing you state wrong, or you aren't dealing with a full deck. Either way, I'll explain it for you in common man terms.Essentially, with ad tools and digital media, advertising becomes bidirectional. The result is more effective and targeted marketing investments. A good web marketing campaign requires specialists who know how to develop, publish, and monitor it, and it almost always yields the expected returns. That's why worldwide ad spending is going to reach $674 billion by the end of 2020 by eMarketer estimates.It may seem as though everyone has something to sell you. Publisher, advertiser, affiliate…everyone finds you fascinating! When I hear about marketing and read articles, I often see a lot of confusion about the entities involved in digital marketing. Let's cut through the confusion with a few brief but clear definitions.The advertiser (or merchant) kicks things off. This company wants to create an advertising campaign to promote its brand, product, or service. The advertiser pays for the promotion.Then there may be an advertising agency to act as an intermediary. In many cases, the advertiser doesn't have the knowledge and experience to create and lead an effective marketing campaign. Creativity and know-how are key, and ad agencies provide those. An ad agency can manage a marketing campaign from planning to publishing and beyond.The last piece of the puzzle is the publisher (or affiliate), an individual or organization that places advertising on digital platforms. Increasingly, big publishers provide full service in advertising, taking on the role of the ad agency as well.You may have heard the term affiliate networks as well. Affiliate networks are virtual spaces where advertisers find publishers and vice versa. Advertisers sign up, load their campaigns, and chose which affiliate program is most suitable. Publishers, in turn, join a network and offer their inventory in exchange for revenue.A variety of payment models exist. With pay-per-impression (or cost-per-impression, CPM), the advertiser pays a fee each time an ad is displayed, regardless of whether the user clicks on it.Another model, pay-per-click (or PPC or CPC) has the advertiser paying the publisher each time the ad is clicked.Finally, pay-per-action is a performance-based model. The advertiser pays each time an agreed action is performed by the user — signing up, say, or registering for a newsletter, buying a product, completing a survey, and so forth.Given the simplicity of the payment models above, it might seem easy to cheat the system and generate fake traffic. That is partly true, although anti-fraud systems mitigate the problem.One of the simplest methods for generating clicks is paid-to-click, which actually is not a scam: Real people really are rewarded for clicking on ads. This “easy money” scheme is fairly well known. People get drawn in by promises of getting big money for doing almost nothing — just clicking links a few hours a day. In reality, you would have to click all day, quickly and without breaks, to make even a few bucks.Another method involves automated scripts, such as ClickJacking. By using this technique, criminals can trick users and “hijack” clicks on some objects, routing them to another page.Then there is malware that can make botnets capable of generating traffic on infected computers for pay-per-click campaigns. Trojan-Clicker is the most prevalent click-fraud malware. This code remains in system memory and attempts to connect to specific Internet resources, such as online ads. That damages not only the digital marketing system, but also the users who unknowingly take part in the fraud.Edit: You can downvote this if you like /u/ablackguy22, but it still doesn't change the fact you are being sold as a product by your streaming service."
dwx9cdm,ablackguy22,"How you just gonna copy paste from Kaspersky as your own.At least two other people downvoted you as well lol. You're being dumb right now. If I'm watching an AceStream, they aint getting money from from a banner ad. And either way, I am not directly supporting the fighter by watching an illegal stream you dork. Me giving a $0.000002 for a click isn't the same as paying $70 for a UFC card, now is it? The guy hosting the stream was going to purchase the card regardless, me watching it does nothing to put more money into the pockets of the UFC or the fighter. You're being obtuse to the nth degree."
dwxck3r,BlackCatsAreMagic,"Because you seem to be illiterate, and don't seem to be able to comprehend information without it being explained down to you."
dwxcym5,ablackguy22,"LOL you read an article for all of 2 seconds, didn't comprehend it all and still posted it when it had nothing to fucking do with what we're talking about. But you have the gall to call me illiterate. I mentioned 3 fucking times I was watching a free stream and you STILL had to ask if I was watching on the UFC site or an illegal stream. Literally nothing you have said so far proves how me watching an illegal stream is supporting the fighter. But continue living in your delusions, please."

I agree they tried way too many plot lines, but honestly even just the alien from another plant thing was just too much.They should have just read the script and said NO and been done."
dx74eqh,DiarrheaMonkey-,"Ever read Ready Player One? When one character is defending the movie Ladyhawk, the other retorts that it was like ""Highlander 2 bad"".I mean, shitty plot lines:OK, now they're all aliens;MacLeod has designed a shield around the earth to protect it;but that shield is causing the environment to suck;there are rebels trying to destroy said shield;Macleod is for some alien reason young again and falls in love with one of the people trying to destroy the shield;all the Higlander stuff.And of course you gotta have Sean Connery in it, so he comes back to life for some reason.If it weren't the sequel to a pretty decent '80s scifi movie, it would definitely qualify as 'so bad it's good'. As is, it's an abomination."
dx7gqr5,maddrb,"I've never actually read ""Ready Player One' - I need to make that happen :) I agree entirely... Abomination is a great description!"
dx7hgmz,DiarrheaMonkey-,"Yeah, the two newer sci-fi and fantasy stuff always referenced in /r/audiobooks are Ready Player One and The Dresden Files. I tried both and The Dresden Files were kinda so-so IMO, but Ready Player One (which I'd put off because it sounded like a video game story) was actually a great throwback/nostalgia oriented story of people in the near future competing to learn about video game/DnD stuff familiar to people that were born in the late '60s to '70s. I was born in '80 but I still knew a few bits of the arcane stuff the characters had to research.More importantly, it's also well written, compelling and has a strong human element."
dx7idkx,maddrb,"That explains why there was so much throw back stuff in the movie. I honestly think they tried to cram as many references in as they thought they could get away with, which was a lot. I'm looking forward to the Blu-Ray coming out so I can waste insane amounts of time trying to identify all the references. I was born in 70, so lot of those are familiar in one way or another :)"
dx7jwdx,DiarrheaMonkey-,"I haven't seen the movie, but I can tell you, some of the references are seriously arcane. Like the exact way to beat Pac-Man, after it glitches because you got too far. The ADnD references I generally got because I played 1st Edition 16-20 years after it came out."

dwx4mbl,tigojones,"He'll plead down to a lesser charge before he gets to court, get a fine/community service, act like he's been proven innocent, and be talking bullshit again in no time."
dwx7frp,TheSmackDownHotel,Pretty much the case for any rich celebrity.
dwxmwfo,Tha_avg_geologist,"Pretty much the case for most people considering the charge is only criminal mischief lol. I remember yesterday on here everyone was actin like this dude was getting deported losing every single penny he's ever made, spending years in jail etc. Gotta love the internet."
dwxpde5,go_comatose_for_me,He's still going to get sued for a bit.
dwxphjv,GiggidyGiggidy777,"Yeah I was wondering about that, are the guys he injured not going to press charges or something??"
dwxq79l,go_comatose_for_me,"Right after I wrote ""sued"" I started thinking. They need to get money to pay for training camp and all that. Conor can probably afford to pay them their due and skip court. As much as a Conor hater as I am, that would probably be the best thing for all involved."
dwxsgbh,TimeTravlnDEMON,Wait does it not say he's being charged with assault with intent to cause harm? It looks like that to me.
dwxvi5s,nomofica,That's exactly what it says.
dwxw0ia,TimeTravlnDEMON,I thought I was going crazy with the people here saying he's been charged with criminal mischief.
dwxwfz4,nomofica,"Nah, just a bunch of McGregor sympathizers trying to downplay the situation."
dwxvjrk,nomofica,> considering the charge is only criminal mischiefNo it isn't. The charge is literally stated in the OP. Assault with intent to cause physical injury. That's significantly more serious than criminal mischief.
dwy6cmz,drfeelokay,"I'd be a little rough on him if I were the prosecutor. From the outside, it looks like he brought a planeload of foreign nationals into the US in order to menace someone over an insult, arranged a conspiracy to illegally gain entry to a building, injured multiple innocent bystanders, and disrupted an event intended to entertain millions of people."
dwyc5zh,tigojones,"I'd love it if they just threw the book at him. Just a nice, big ""Fuck you, you're going to jail!"" I just don't think that'll be likely."

dwxxzc5,Drogalov,You think he's fighting there again? He'll dine out on this for a couple of years before he even has to think about it
dwwzfq6,deathmouse,I guarantee this will be turned into t-shirts and posters. Kinda like that Sinatra mugshot you see plastered everywhere
dwx03z8,kneeco28,"Sinatra was arrested 80 years ago for having consensual sex with one of his unmarried girlfriends while he himself was married. The charges were ""seduction"" and ""adultery"" lol. Context matters. The story is a large part of what makes the photo iconic."
dwx1hmc,stay_fr0sty,I think you are giving far too much credit to his hardcore fan base. The people that get so rowdy in commercial flights that they actually have to turn them around? Couldn't imagine they'd care about the nuance between Sinatra's and McGregor's arrest.That mugshot is already on t-shirts...I guarantee it.
dwxrhsd,LisbonTreaty,You're right. McGregor's Mugshot t-shirt is already up. https://teespring.com/shop/mcgregor-mugshot-with-backgro
dwx1lo9,kneeco28,I'm not saying it won't be a thing. I'm saying it won't be analogues to the Sinatra situation at all even if both involve mugshots on t-shirts.Conor also isn't at all analogues to Rosa Parks even though he was arrested due to a bus incident.
dwx6xpz,GingerSpencer,"Nah, it was a mugshot of Sinatra and that was cool so it went on a t-shirt. The story is meaningless."
dwx5ly2,joebleaux,"I'm sure most people who see that mugshot don't know the story, so I don't think you are right on that one."
dwx4lu7,hughie-d,Che Guevara t-shirts are my answer to your scepticism.
dwxjuuf,_NoHayBanda,Che is an icon for great reasons. But I agree that many people wearing his image done understand why.

dwxp8ar,iblamejoelsteinberg,Go say that anywhere in Miami.
dwxqqdj,robot_swagger,>Che is an icon for great reasons. But I agree that many people wearing his image done understand why. Don't forget rolling tins.
dwxnxfk,BoringPersonAMA,No one knows or cares about the story behind Sinatra's mug shot. It's cool because it's Sinatra.
dwxrmuj,BrandonfromNewJersey,I dont know about you but flying 20 of your ghetto mates in a private jet to go attack a busload of UFC fighters with the main target being a man with close ties to warlords and gangster oligarchs and walking away without a scratch on you and most likely a slap on the wrist from the cops is definitely a better story than sleeping with someone while married.
dwx20p8,IIllIIllIlllI,unmarried girlfriends? Why is their relationship status relevant? Did the fact that they were unmarried make it worse?
dwx25np,kneeco28,"It was 1938 dude, people were messed up (they still are, but we've made progress). Maybe seduction only applied to unmarried women and sleeping with married women was a different count of adultery? Who the fuck knows."
dwx2fgr,IIllIIllIlllI,I thought you knew. nevermind.
dwyixid,helzinki,Supreme gonna make a lot of money on this.
dwx0glu,Mammuthuss,Could he be barred from entering the US now?
dwx22hy,moonshiver,Yes. Connor v Khabib in Dagestan!!!But he's a celebrity so he'll probably be fine.
dwxi5pw,84JPG,"I'm not sure the US does that to famous people who can afford expensive lawyers, Justin Bieber can still enter the United States whenever he pleases after getting arrested a couple of times."
dwxn08n,dragooner00,"I think the difference is a Justin beiber didn't assualt someone with intent while being trained and in the country on a work visa. Essentially an immigrant just assualted multiple US citizens with intent. If the New York DA wants to fuck connor, they are absolutely capable, also there is tons of video evidence."
dwy0u61,ImSendingYouAway,"> Justin beiber didn't assualt someone with intent [Eh, fucking street racing and resisting arrest okay then?](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/09/02/bieber-arrest-timeline_n_5755652.html)> while being trainedWhat does that matter? Bieber is trained to be a douchebag, so what?> in the country on a work visa. And? It's okay if you're a tourist?"
dwy0zf5,dragooner00,"It's pretty common knowledge that martial artists in the US can be convicted of assualt due to training. And no it's not ok if you are a tourist. I'm saying he's more likely to be removed and prevented back into the country since he did his crime on a work visa, not as an American citizen, and the crimes he committed we're against a US citizen. That's how a person on a visa gets their access to the states revoked."
dwy7lk9,GalwayUW,Being charged with assault with weapons because you train is a myth.
dwx384a,howyabiys,Highly unlikely
dwy6mbi,drfeelokay,What makes it unlikely? He brought a planeload of foreign nationals into the united states in order to menace a public figure and ended up injuring two US citizens. I won't be surprised if his lawyers wriggle him out of this - but it doesn't seem like a slam-dunk for him at all.
dwx7wtj,wallstreetexecution,Not really.State Department does it all the time.
dwx8co6,howyabiys,Not someone as profitable as McGregor I hate to say it
dwxj9fs,The_Year_of_Glad,The Pirates' starting third baseman lost his visa two years ago because he picked up a DUI *in another country*. Conor being denied re-entry is very much a possibility.
dwxhow6,Bobby_Bouch,"State Department does not make money from him, they do not give a shit"
dwxmzk1,mindhunter65,No but his High profile lawyers he's about to hire won't let it happen.
dwxn8kx,ObeyRoastMan,Taxes?
dwy376c,84JPG,For the United States government (and any wealthy country with a decent sized population) whatever Conor McGregor gives in taxes is practically nothing. The reason is that he can afford expensive lawyers.
dwy5s4n,ObeyRoastMan,"Probably true, but the government sure as fuck got their cut of Conor's 100M payday which would more than pay for any legal fees. Pretty sure the government isn't run that way though lol."
dwxnsr2,Bobby_Bouch,State department is not the IRS
dwxoxzk,ObeyRoastMan,Neither are schools and they get tax money. Dafuq you on about?
dwx8wep,wallstreetexecution,They do.
dwxaem4,TearShitDown,For example?
dwxe1bd,Political_moof,Amy Winehouse was famously denied a visa to the US. IIRC it was for an assault charge.
dwxg073,TearShitDown,"I googled it, it looks like drugs were the main issue, but point taken."
dwx21o9,_Trigglypuff_,I imagine this is him enroute to preliminary hearings. He may likely have another court date.
dwxe4vk,spkr4thedead51,only if he's actually convicted of a felony. it'll probably be pled down to misdemeanor and he'll pay a fine
dwy4cwm,glswenson,"Could, but won't. Celebrities never are"
dwxul1p,WillSixtySix,Conor's one call in jail to Dana -“Dana 50 g's baby..... please.”
dwx14da,BlackCatsAreMagic,I fear for the hoodlum sitting in lockdown who's never watched an MMA fight because they can't afford cable who decides to talk shit to the little whiteboy with the funny beard in holding.
dwx8das,Megatron_McLargeHuge,"Nah, they're keeping him separated because too many people would take the chance to prove themselves."
dwxbd6c,ThatCooganKid,"This. I've always wonder how that “War Machine” guy is doing in prison. Like how many times has some one tried to prove themselves against him or are they keeping him separated. If they are keeping him separate, for how long? That's gotta cost a lot in money, resources, manpower, etc."
dwxcxg5,bjjpolo,I think he tried to kill himself in prison which might mean he's not mixed in with gen pop? I don't know though.

dwxum5u,orangeblueorangeblue,"If you're a suicide risk, they put you in restricted housing for suicide watch. Medical segregation is also a possibility."

dwxc581,MyNamesMikeD75,Dude was a piece of shit he's probably getting beat down on the regular

dwxii9b,Technomnom,Welcome to prison friend. Lucky if its only 4.
dwxjrtq,TheSweetestKill,Also it's not like you get the same kind of exercise and diet in the clink to keep up the body mass like when you are at the top of your game.
dwxp47o,TheRadBomber,Not saying its easy but you ever seen a prison documentary? There's a lot of jacked dudes in prison.
dwy1ah0,Some_Dude_,"Mayweather lost like 8lbs of muscle during the 2 months he was in jail, complaining about the quality of food and trying to get special treatment the whole time he was in.Yeah there's jacked dudes in prison, but aesthetically jacked and world class athlete jacked are two different beasts with completely different requirements to maintain."
dwxl0p9,barbarismbeginshome,"These guys aren't going to struggle to maintain weight, War Machine was under 80kg at 5'10"" that isn't hard."
dwxks99,2ND_Dinner,"Keep in mind, there's no weight classes in prison. I know there's that video of Huerta knocking out a big football player, but just saying, there are some big, angry, athletic guys in prison."

dwy892r,go_comatose_for_me,You've never heard of pay-to-stay prisons? Been many articles about them over the past 10 years or so that I know of.
dwxruxm,SirAdrian0000,"Prison doesn't have weight classes, I don't know how many ex ufc guys are in jail but there's a good chance if there is, that jail has some one bigger then then that fighter."
dwxntzh,BoringPersonAMA,Have you seen recent pictures? He lost like a hundred pounds.
dwxtrf9,PreSchoolGGW,Gods we can certainly hope so
dwycl1c,kidokidokidkid,"Like prison isn't filled with other pieces of shit. That said a big part of surviving in prison is having connections and the social skills to make those connections. War Machine is kinda lacking in the social skills department, so I could see him pissing of a gang and getting the shank."
dwyebp1,cbassmn1251,"......he's in prison, you really think he's that much different from plenty of other inmates? You do realize there are plenty of murderers in there right? Prison is not a righteous place, pieces of shit are pretty common there."
dwzhlb3,Bobwayne17,"It doesn't cost a lot. If you go to PC you're just a bitch and you'll be with all the pedos, but only guards will fuck you up. It's not a failsafe but it works well. PC units are always around, ‘ol War Machine isn't costing the system anything extra."
dwyf8l2,XerathXRenekton,Seriously. And it's NYC. We have guys in prison here who would tear the UFC a new one if they could beat a drug test.
dwxpt60,Jakobe909,"He did have that fight with Mayweather, so I doubt people wouldn't recognize him."
dwxxsap,pronhaul2012,"i don't, because if said hoodlum existed, he'd have a knife and 4 or 5 other guys with him. prisoners don't fight fair because they figured out a long time ago that in their world, if you lose a fight, it could be the last thing you ever do."
dwyhqf7,DC_Fan_Forever,lol
dwxklmd,2ND_Dinner,"Conor would beat up all of them one on one, probably (at some point, size and strength... there's a reason why there are weight classes), but there are some scary people walking around Brooklyn/NYC and they don't give a fuck. Conor better watch his mouth. He better not say any of the racist shit he said on the Mayweather fight promotional tour."

dwx9m0x,StaticTie,I don't know about alt-right but there is definitely a race power dynamic at play
dwxfe72,celestial1,"You're getting downvoted, but he did bring race into."
dwxg04e,StaticTie,"Yeah that's fine, it happens when you bring up race in some subs. Unpopular but oh well I guess."
dwxfpvt,butterflyp00n,"In what way?.. The only racial thing I saw was the fact that he mentioned that connor's a ""whiteboy"", insinuating that would make him an easy person to fuck up in prison. If anything that's derogatory to white people"
dwxhkt9,GoPrimalRed,the use of “whiteboy” made it clear that said broke hoodlum was non white. It low key drew heavy on a lot of racial stereotypes.
dwxhnz1,StaticTie,"I don't think you can separate hoodlum from race in the context of his comment. And when it's framed as someone who can't afford cable, against Connor - the white boy, it becomes problematic. It goes on to hope that the hoodlum gets beat up by Connor, so thats where I read the subtle racism."
dwxjp10,_NoHayBanda,"I agree. Whether intentional or not, the comment clearly introduced racial stereotypes into the discussion."
dwxd1ar,Cock_Johnson_,Lol there's a lot of 6'8” 400lb dudes in prisons that are in gangs. They'd love a chance to shank this white boy in the back of the neck when he isn't looking. he's going to ad-seg to lose some IQ points.
dwxdck4,BlackCatsAreMagic,"You're right. There are lots of 6'8, 400lb dudes in prison. McG is in the county jail near the courthouse. Jail and prison aren't the same thing."
dwxfs7v,rkk2,I like how you called out the comment but conceded there are a lot of 6'8 400 lb people in prison. That was probably the most ridiculous part of it.
dwxfyqs,BlackCatsAreMagic,I didn't really care about the semantics. It was the general idea that McG is sitting in prison I had to comment on.
dwxg29n,rkk2,Yeah that's kind of what I figured was going on. Didn't mean to make it seem like I thought you actually agreed.
dwxei44,Cock_Johnson_,Ahh thought he went to prison my bad
dwy4cap,glswenson,"In what world does someone get arrested and then end up in prison less than 24 hours later? Without a court hearing, etc. That's impossible."

dwwzpvy,nickfield1996,Wow. All he's being charged with is assault with intent to cause physical injury. Dude's actually just gonna get a slap on the wrist.
dwx2tmj,sgSaysR,He's been charged with Felony Criminal Mischief. Since he has no priors he'll likely plead down to a misdemeanor with heavy fines and probation.The civil lawsuits and immigration status are his main problems.
dwxdzk8,Quasar420,"UPDATE FROM ARIEL ON TWITTER - As part of McGregor's bail package he will be allowed to fly back home to Ireland. They are not seizing his passport. Court date not set just yet.Conor McGregor's bail has been set for 50k, sources confirm. Cian Cowley's bail has been set for 25k."
dwxu3wh,PreSchoolGGW,Money talks
dwxek3q,sgSaysR,"Well the US government is currently deporting individuals who have no criminal records aside from immigration issues themselves. Businessmen who operated companies for 30 years are being sent back to their home countries. Criminal conviction for assaulting American citizens, he certainly wouldn't be able to reside in the states. He may be able to work short-term. But that presents another problem with media obligations, training, etc"
dwxeq1y,Quasar420,"Thanks for the response. Yeah, I am very curious to find out the details of his probation and visa. He almost certainly will get probation at the least. Hopefully it goes quick through the courts so we can find out soon."
dwxn3xj,sushisection,Conor is white though they might treat him different
dwyhobd,JayBoo1980,People get rich and white mixed up alot.
dwxs94d,bodangren2,Here's not brown or black. He's probably ok.
dwwzzky,jccraig1199,"It'll be the law suits that'll be the real issue. People are playing it up, he broke a window and the glass cut people. It's hardly Jon Jones hit and run on pregnant lady, Mayweather beating women, or Tyson sexual abusing someone. Just to clarify, I'm not justifying his actions and I think he should be punished. I just think that people who compare what he did to Jon Jones or Mayweather are hugely overreacting."
dwx19ve,semipro_redditor,"I think intent should honestly be the main cause for judgement (not punishment) . If Jon Jones has crashed into a pole and only hurt himself would you be so mad? What if he just drove drunk/fucked up and didn't crash? The crime is the same, he was reckless and selfish. He obviously didn't mean to crash into a car and had no way of knowing there was a pregnant woman inside. Conor had 100% intention to do what he did. And then took off running the same way Jones did. What if there was a pregnant woman in the crowd that got hit by a monster energy can? Or on the bus that fell in the chaos?"
dwx1y0z,scottishwhiskey,"He had intent to drive under the influence, which is far more dangerous than throwing a dolly at a bus. Jon could have killed that woman very easily, he could have killed himself, he could have killed a child in someone else's car. There wasn't a pregnant woman on the bus, Conor knew that. Jon didn't know who he could crash into. What Jon did was orders of magnitude worse."
dwx5a8g,semipro_redditor,"Dont get me wrong, driving drunk is a shitty and dangerous thing to do and it should be punished heavily. But the fact is that he was trying to get home, there is no malice in that. Negligence, arrogance, and stupidity in spades, but not intent to hurt someone. He would have preferred to get home safely. There is certainly malice in what Conor did however. He also texted Dana and said ""it had to be done"" so he sort of took out any doubt about his intentions."
dwx9sgb,,[deleted]
dwxag5q,semipro_redditor,"> from a legal perspectiveAbsolutely agree. But in a court of public opinion, there is a very clear distinction in terms of intent. One person was trying to drive home and fucked up, and one person was trying to hurt people and succeeded.And again, I'm not sugarcoating it. Drunk driving is awful. I personally know someone who killed someone while driving drunk. While I think what he did was awful and he deserves everything that's coming to him, I'm not sitting here thinking he committed pre-calculated murder."
dwxdoxe,,[deleted]
dwxf8x6,semipro_redditor,"Jesus, way to miss the point. What I'm saying is people like to say he broke a pregnant womans arm like he did it on purpose, or had any intention of doing that. Use your head. What was the sentence before the part you cherrypicked? Could that have any relation to the quote you posted?"
dwxjxd4,thebross9,"""I had no idea there was a housing complex on the other side of the woods here, my only intent was to recreate the machine gun scene from Predator""On a serious note, I just don't see that logic flying outside of the abstract."
dwxqal3,AstroWorldSecurity,That argument is so beyond asinine.
dwy7bzc,drfeelokay,"> He had intent to drive under the influence, which is far more dangerous than throwing a dolly at a bus.I think you're underestimating the danger of breaking windows inches away from where someone is sitting. It's not clear at all that 100 instances of drunk driving would result in worse consequences than 100 instances of throwing heavy metal objects at people through glass."
dwz1cqr,scottishwhiskey,Both are very dangerous. I don't mean to underplay the severity of Conor's assault. Drinking and driving is far more dangerous though.
dwx41p4,AftyOfTheUK,"> He had intent to drive under the influence, which is far more dangerous than throwing a dolly at a bus. I'm not sure that's 100% true. Given the weight of a dolly, and glass on the bus, the likelihood of causing an injury is very very high - in this instance the dolly didn't even go through the window, which it easily could do on a larger window which would cause potentially horrific injuries (glass shards compressed into the body with 20kg of weight moving at speed?).Drink and drive is something a shitload of people do every night, and almost all of them make it home without incident. Every town has that shitty bar with a dickhead that drives home drunk 5 nights a week and hasn't had a crash in a decade.Plus drink drivers aren't **intending** to hurt someone. They're just being careless."
dwx4jpn,scottishwhiskey,"This is incredibly backwards. Getting into a 2 ton vehicle that you can move 60-100 miles per hour is infinitely more dangerous than throwing a dolly at a bus. You could make the same argument that Conor wasn't intending to hurt Khabib, he was just trying to scare him by damaging the bus and did so in a careless way."
dwx5ni2,AftyOfTheUK,"> Getting into a 2 ton vehicle that you can move 60-100 miles per hour is infinitely more dangerous than throwing a dolly at a bus.It is not. Analysing risk is about severity and probability.Let's make arbitrary numbers out of 10 here. Car severity is as high as 10 - potentially killing a group of people but we'll go with 8 because most of the time injuries aren't that severe. But the probability is very VERY low - the vast majority of people who drive drunk do it repeatedly and rarely have an accident, and when they do most of those accidents don't hurt anyone else... so it's a 1Dolly-throwing might only get a 3 or a 4 on severity because the expected set of injuries would include fatalities only a small number of times, and most wounds would be treatable or superficial. But it would rate a 9 or a 10 on the probability scale, because throwing a dolly at a full coach window will almost always results in injuries for people sat near the window."
dwxmyvo,King_Jon_Snow,"> But it would rate a 9 or a 10 on the probability scale, because throwing a dolly at a full coach window will almost always results in injuries for people sat near the window.In the interest of science, I'm gonna need you to throw a dolly at 1000 bus windows with people seated next to the window, and parse the data on the rate of injurys. Missing the window counts as a throw. Preferably, do some coke first"
dx2ndom,AftyOfTheUK,"> I'm gonna need you to throw a dolly at 1000 bus windows, do some coke firstGot it. Railing one line per throw?"
dwx5epy,hignz,This comment is actually hilarious.
dwx80xu,wallstreetexecution,No
dwxcyyr,jamesd1100,"Damn I didn't intend to take a dozen tequila shots and drive my car into a busload of children killing all of them, I just wanted to get home from the bar! Don't judge me by my actions, judge me by intent! Such a dumb way of thinking."
dwxfc8u,semipro_redditor,Have a fun life judging and interpreting actions by their outcomes.
dwxjzj6,thebross9,"If the outcome is people die, then yeah that's a pretty valid method in that instance. You're being ridiculous."
dx9t5rp,jamesd1100,"Manslaughter is legally defined to RULE OUT INTENT. Intent should never be a part of the law unless on the extreme other end, where a murder or robbery or whatever the fuck is plotted and premeditated etc. So fucking stupid"
dwxkzn1,semipro_redditor,Really? Anything anyone does that results in death deserves to be judged as intentional murder? What a juvenile opinion
dwxl572,thebross9,I said every one is a murder? No. You make so many goddamn assumptions it's stupid. Go back under your rock. Git!
dwxp94k,TheGrandSyndicate,Lol wtf? Outcomes are what matter the most.
dx9t1ha,jamesd1100,I meant to be funny when I tackled that guy who broke his hip. What do you mean I'm being sued?!?!?!?!
dwxbgo4,Riasfdsoab,It doesn't matter what you think honestly.
dwx5d7n,clutchy22,Shit people are shit people and society should not hold them above what they really are.
dwx1uva,NonrepresentativeFat,Flying to a differnet city to physically assault somebody is a pretty big deal. Breaking into a venue and injuring several people and destroying property is a big deal. It show intent. I won't be surpised if they add several charges once they are done with the investigation. Also won't be surprised if WME ends up sueing the pants off him.
dwx2jry,jccraig1199,"If you think WME are gonna sue the hell out of him your deluded, he's the UFC biggest cash cow. They'll get way more off him if when he fights again. The WME are a business, they'll opt for whichever option gets them more money. Man, what he did is totally unacceptable, in an ideal world he should be punished. But he's gonna get away lightly, there nothing we can do about it at this point. We're just gonna have to accept it."
dwx3xym,NonrepresentativeFat,Are you under the impression that a lawsuit nullifies his current contract? If money is all they want then reecouping losses through litigation will get them that and Conor will still be under contract ensuring his next fight(s) are under the UFC promotion.
dwx7337,hotel_air_freshener,The UFC will sue the shit out of him for having to scrap 3 fights. I doubt hes getting out of this without a massive financial loss.
dwx7wvw,TheSmackDownHotel,UFC ain't suing Conor lol Come on
dwxbwa3,deskamess,Leverage. You make him pay or there is some deal where he signs a multi-fight deal where he fights regularly. Either way the UFC is obligated to minimize the loss of 2 fights.
dwxk6x7,Davemeddlehed,"You can't stipulate in a fight contract that someone must fight regularly. You can't even force them to fight at all, it's unethical."
dwxqc5j,deskamess,Fair enough... but you can add it as an incentive... a $huge incentive.
dwxpqju,TheRadBomber,"You're right anybody claiming that it's on the same level just hates Conor. I've been a Conor ""hater"" for awhile but while what he did was profoundly stupid and reckless it's not even close to Mayweather or Jones."
dwx315x,sgSaysR,You are forgetting intent. Did Jones get in his vehicle with the intent to have a hit and run accident with a pregnant lady? No. He fucked up royally and deserved what he got but he didn't intend to do it.McGregor on the hand and his army of thugs went into the Barclay center with the intent to commit violence. They did so against UFC employees. They damaged property and injured people. And they intended to do so.In my opinion it's worse than Jones and it isn't even close.
dwx3d7n,jccraig1199,"Well he did intend to drive off. What about Mayweather beating woman, he intended to do that. Mike intended to sexually abuse someone. Yet they're all still successful and worshipped by the masses. Shit I don't mean to defend McGregor but I'm just pointing out that there's has been way worse done by other famous people that isn't on the same level as McGregor crimes and yet everyone is acting like he killed 10 people. Once again I'm not trying defending him or his actions what he did is wrong."
dwx82sd,wallstreetexecution,You're being a pathetic Conor apologist.
dwxb2e7,NonrepresentativeFat,And he's talking about shit he clearly doesn't understand.
dwx26hi,dremic,Theres only one person that will actually get any money out of this and its Chiesa.
dwx5vgw,joebleaux,There's a guy with a broken hand. And the bus company will get money for the bus too. Borg could have eye damage as well.
dwxnb5k,King_Jon_Snow,"McGregor is going to buy the bus, and use it to cart his crew to his next fight."
dwx6115,dremic,Guess we'll see.
dwx5g4a,DrasticXylophone,The UFC employees will also get taken care of.
dwx5r70,dremic,Only if they were actually assaulted by Conor himself - which is unconfirmed. Sure maybe they will sue anyways and maybe they will get some money. But People acting like hes gonna be broke after this lol.. come on.
dwx68em,DrasticXylophone,Doesn't really matter who did it. The UFC will make Conor pay their employees and Conor will do so. But as you say he is never going to be broke. Fucker just flew 30 people into NY just to attack Khabib
dwx8kg8,TacoNinja31,"Well he certainly might go broke in the future, it just won't be from any lawsuits resulting from this innocent. Just look at how many athletes, especially fighters, go bankrupt after their careers.http://www.espn.com/30for30/film?page=brokehttp://mobile.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/sports/tyson-s-bankruptcy-is-a-lesson-in-ways-to-squander-a-fortune.html"
dwxb1dj,DrasticXylophone,Oh I know they can go broke but that is when they retire. Conor is in the prime of his career and has 100 million already banked. He may be pissing through it right now but for now he can afford it.
dwxhhcf,Scagnettio,"I wonder, is this really true. Doesn't it take shit load of time to get visa's?"
dwxk241,Davemeddlehed,"He didn't need a Visa to stay the weekend, or even just a few hours of he wasn't intending top work or stay long term."
dwxuji6,Scagnettio,But his 20 goons?
dwxx6fl,Davemeddlehed,You don't need a visa to visit a country for the day. Just a passport and a plane ticket.
dwy731a,drfeelokay,"What Jones did is really bad and worse in terms of harm - but this was more brazen, malicious, and planned. I know a lot of people of good character who have driven under the influence, as bad as it is - I don't know anyone of good character who has done something like this."
dwx1cbw,pm_me_beautiful_cups,"true, i wonder if they did a bloodtest to check if he was on something.(i know everyone has his guesses etc, but having something concrete would be nice)"

Both of them can and will and should sue Conor for a reasonable amount of money and both will get paid more than they would have if they fought this weekend. To me it seems like there's maybe even 5 fighters who should get paid by Conor for this weekend.Lobov deserves to get pulled for participating instead of staying on his bus and pulling the ""I didn't even know they were here"" card. Sucks for him, but Conor will probably slide him a couple tens of thousands for all this shit.Dana White probably did not orchestrate this but I can guarantee you that he is god damn fucking ecstatic about it, regardless of his public comments. Conor has drawn a lot of attention to 223. Conor has drawn a lot of attention to the UFC overall, he's drawn attention to himself, he's drawn attention to Khabib, and he's drawn attention to a potential rivalry between the two. That ticket will sell PPVs. Dana White is not remotely as dumb as we make him out to be on this sub. Dude's been basically running the UFC for 17 years, I've been watching that dense motherfucker for about the past 15. He knows the publicity this has brought to a bunch of potential shit. He also knows how much money Conor is about to lose in lawsuits and will be looking for a payday or two. Dana main thoughts now are whether he should have McGregor/Diaz or McGregor/Nurmagomedov first. Everyone will end up paid from this."

dwx74mm,logosnakiworld,I know it may not sound well but I hope Conor compensates Michael and Ray economically and issues an formal apology to them and to their teams and this horror dissolves without further legal actions..

dwxg0ez,SailorChamp,"I seriously want to know his thought process on this. ""Hey I'm legit making millions of dollars with UFC...it might be a good idea to show up and publically assault a bunch of people and cause a bunch of property damage while everyone is filming me. I think UFC will really like it if I attack them. Maybe next I should consider stripping naked, painting my entire body black, then running through Manhattan waving an AK until the cops kill me.

dwy7teg,TheSmackDownHotel,EIRE! EIRE! EIRE! ERIE! WHERE'S HE AT?!
dwyfh1f,thelazarusledd,So he won't be able to enter USA again? Lol who am I kidding as soon as they see his bank account status its gonna be this way sir.
dwyjm1u,janam_fadaye_rahbar,"It's a pretty flattering mugshot, honestly"
dwx2yya,CheekyFifaCunt_7,I pictured McGregor would have a crazy smile
dwxbajl,vietbren007,Jesus they are really milking this April fools ting

dwxx3k2,destinyplayer1,"He fucked up. He seemed like a cool guy in the Notorious documentary, now hes a perp. Nut job."
dwy5c6k,Kougat,He was a cool down to earth guy before he became huge. Now his brash persona has become a reality and he thinks he can do no wrong. He has too many yes men and hangs with too many Irish mobsters.
dwyw2zm,destinyplayer1,"Yes, in the documentary I saw, he had way too many hanger on type people but I guess it's part of that lifestyle. Still no excuse for doing what he did."
dwyw9jw,Kougat,Yeah it's a shame because he was a good dude before. Casuals are loving this move by Mcgregor because it makes him more crazy and interesting but most MMA and Mcgregor fans are disappointed in his actions. Tough to defend him as a human being anymore.
dwywlua,destinyplayer1,"I know, he worked so hard to get to the mma and now Dana white wants nothing to do with his cash cow. At first I thought it might have been a planned publicity stunt gone awry but clearly seems unlikely at this point."

dwx0wgs,sleepingonstones,I was half expecting him to make some kind of face at the camera. I'm surprised
dwx8xtz,asleeplessmalice,Imagine that face he makes at weigh ins with his eyes wide open and tongue wagging about. I wonder if he strolled up the the mugshot with waving his arms about?

dwx78qk,32TDE32,Disappointed he's not smiling like an evil genius or a maniac lol
dwx7lqo,Modernist1849,What is the likely criminal penalty (if any) for this? Lawyers?
dwx7ww4,ravenswin,"Have family that are lawyers. He'll probably plea down to misdemeanor battery and criminal mischief. Misdemeanors carry up to a year in jail each. He won't serve that long, but he isn't a great candidate for probation because he doesn't live in New York (though he still might get it with a good lawyer)."
dwx7ygk,spooky23_dml,"I think every cop there hasn't taken photos. Been sent the prisoner movement slip photo and another one I can't share (nothing exciting tbh). Apparently they're all enjoying his visit. Worth it then Conor, you made new friends."

dwxa3vd,BjornManburger,Flair checks out
dwx8pnt,USADevils,That's a felony according to 3 seconds of google research
dwx99fi,definitelynotbeardo,I'm pretty sure it's [this](http://ypdcrime.com/penal.law/article120.htm#p120.00). Appears to be a class A misdemeanor. I am not a lawyer though.
dwxatgf,Alexinhow,Hi r/MMA could anyone sum up what happened? Here in Italy there is not much coverage about MMA
dwxb26i,PR8692,"Khabib and his goons surrounded Conor's friend Artem, and Khabib slapped him. Two days later Conor and twenty other goons fly into New York and attack the bus with ufc 223 fighters inside of it. They were trying to get to Khabib and his team. Conor through shit at the bus a window and it smashed and two fighters were injured. He turned himself into police after. He's in court at the moment. After spending the night in a holding cell."
dwxb7cf,Alexinhow,"Thanks a lot men. Do you think this is ""serious"" shit or it's just going to turn into a PR move?"
dwxbgmn,PR8692,"It's serious, he'll get a million and one law suits after this. But there is no such thing as bad publicity so it'll probably by turned into some sort of PR move when they put Conor up against Khabib. The majority of this sub are pissed with McGregor (including myself) but there is a lot of people (casuals mainly) who are supportive of him on social Media, they think he was looking out for a friend."
dwxe1ar,jar1792,"It should be more serious than it will end up being. His felony will be dropped down in a plea deal outside of court. As far as the criminal component goes, I'd bet he walks with community service and a fine. His civil suits will cost a little more but will also settle out of court."
dwxbmse,Alexinhow,Ok I get it. Thanks :)
dwxbnnd,brayshizzle,It is acceptable to get the mugshot on a tshirt yet?
dwxgs34,Basbeeky,Genuine question: how is this public information?
dwxnrmt,crackyJsquirrel,Because it all is. All arrest records are public information. You can find out the arrest history of anyone.
dwyl3ag,Basbeeky,That's pretty lame to be honest. We (netherlands) sometimes requiere someone to show a VOG. Which basically tells your future employee that you've done nothing illegal or havent been in touch with police. It doesnt tell them what you did.
dwyrufd,crackyJsquirrel,"Why? It's called accountability. If the police can arrest you and not have to tell people why, they can arrest you for anything and nobody would know if it was legal or not. There is a difference between being arrested and convicted. Being arrested doesnt mean anything, you are not guilty of what you are arrested for until you are convicted. Employers in America don't look at arrest records, they look at what you have been found guilty of. And by the way, what you are convicted of is also public record."
dwxi4lg,JewResistance,"That looks says he doesn't give a shit to me. Not sure how to feel about all this, definitely not a good look for him"

dwxkxa4,BannedOnMyMain17,Alright nobody panic...but is that a tear in his left eye?
dwxmswp,IceCreaaams,You can tell that other dudes attorney is a “criminal” attorney ala Saul Goodman. He looks like someone graduated from the Goodfellas and went to law school.

dwxzamh,slainfate,This is all just to set up a Khabib fight mind game tactic. Conor is going to be escorted to the octogon in an orange jumpsuit and chains with guards holding shotguns. And guard dogs don't forget the guard dogs and also fresh prison ink...

dwy2nq1,machineagainstrage,"I think I'm a little late to this party, but he looks pretty satisfied in that mugshot"
dwy3i9h,Aristotle-sux,Does anyone know why he pulled this bullshit?
dwydhug,bodhisoma,Looking for an excuse to bail. Better for people to wonder if Conor won't defend because he's a coward than to just quit and remove all doubt.Way past transparent.
dwy587f,Kougat,"His good friend and teammate got stepped up on by Khabib and his crew. Didnt look like a ton but they intimidated him and gave him a bit of a slap on the head. Mcgregor is from Krumlin, is friends with irish mobsters, has fuck you money, and generally doesnt give a fuck so that was enough for him to pull this."
dwy7mu1,Aristotle-sux,"Huh! I'm not as mad at Mcgregor if this is in fact true. I mean, usually I'd be inclined to say violence isn't the solution but these guys are actual fighters..."
dwydec1,RockChalk80,He could have killed Rose.
dwycj2y,AbundantFailure,I mean except he only hurt people with fuck all to do with any of this.
dwy3x8a,100roundmaga,"Yes, he was trying to get at Khabib, who was on the bus. Khabib and 8 or 9 of his crew cornered one of Conor's friends and training partner and surrounded him, called him faggot, slapped him, bullied and scared him. So Conor came back looking for revenge.The fucking fake news is already spinning for some reason, saying Conor was there causing trouble because his title was about to be stripped for not defending it. I guess some people with NBC must have part ownership of the UFC."
dwycr45,Billalone,"> Khabib and 8 or 9 of his crew cornered one of Conor's friends and training partner and surrounded him, called him faggot, slapped him, bullied and scared him.It was more like they called him on his bullshit, considering the prior interview where Artem (Friend in question) called Khabib a coward and a pussy and said he'd slap him when next they met."

dwx5387,BumDiddy,I wouldn't. You already got all the action before the fights. But I see where you're coming from.
dwx6p1q,The_UnApologist,The ~~Maclife~~. **THUGLIFE!!!**
dwxb9oj,mikejr96,The part that is being overlooked in all of this is how easy and precisely he threw that fuckin thing. That man has thrown a dolly before. That shit is heavy as hell and anyone who's ever worked with one knows that. Dude launched it and almost decapitated chiesa. If it just falls short and hits the bus this is totally different. Jesus.
dwxpy71,jlange94,Excellent mugshot. Makes me think of an Irish spy or agent or something.
dwxyst0,A_Great_Forest,"He could start a raucus at a retirement facility or a daycare and I'd still root for him. I'm typing this as I watch Notorious on Netflix™. No one beings hype like Conor, and I love it. Can we set him loose at the Equifax HQ building? I'd pay top dollar for an event like that!"
dwxlrj9,Hambjob,"I wonder if they'll try to throw on heavier penalties for the assault charge since he's technically trained to hurt people through assault. Like what happened to Nic Cage in Con Air. On a serious note, you could argue that he has trained to knock out his opponents quickly and with least resistance possible, meaning he is only trained to knock people unconscious with precision, not kill them with ease like Nic Cage in Con Air. Edit: On a serious note, punching anyone in the head or knocking someone unconscious can easily lead to a life-threatening brain hemorrhage due to the blunt force trauma sustained throughout the brain. If you hit your head wrong with just enough force blood seeps into your brain, strangles it through pressure, leaves you brain-damaged or dead. This is why assault is serious and why you should avoid a fight even if you know you can win. One wrong hit or fall from a person you hit could end their life and leave you imprisoned for a long time."
dwxlxep,Jacked1218,Yeah but Cameron Poe killed a man.
dwxmbxm,Hambjob,"In his defense the man pulled a knife on him after harassing his wife and bringing two friends along to beat the shit out of him in a darkened parking lot, while she was with him. He didn't kill the guy until the knife came out, but once it did he Nic Caged 'em good. Edit: I really hope Conor wasn't dressed in a bear suit or this could be a whole 'nother situation we just can't make up a context for..."

dwx0aeg,TheSmackDownHotel,Mugshots are made public.
dwx0c9l,AndyDufresne2,It's a public record. NYPD probably released it immediately to the press because they knew it was going to get FOIA'd anyways
dwx130s,Kobedoe,I want this on a t shirt
dwx5b4k,Michael_Negron,Solid mug shot
dwx62lr,Diablo165,"The idiocy astounds me. He's got a son to dote on and money to spend, and he chooses to throw shit at busses?I mean, shit - it would have been more fun and less money to take his people paintballing than this."
dwxid9s,GoPrimalRed,"If he was more like you, he wouldn't be a millionaire global icon fighter."
dwxj4a0,Diablo165,True - he'd be posting on reddit from the loo.
dwxb7yy,mongopotamus,"Dana said they were in the middle of negotiating McGregor's new contract this week when this happened (ESPN Get Up this morning). So in addition to criminal, civil, and immigration consequences.... Conor just completely and totally fucked himself on his new contract. This will go down as the most expensive window ever broken in history."

dwxslg8,IceCreaaams,that was spinal
dwy2qxp,bovadeez,Here's a sobering thought. Connor is 6 months younger than me and has made more money than I ever will.
dwyixp2,chr0nic_eg0mania,Its not too late to throw dollies at buses.
dwy43r8,Yegs454,He's lucky money mayweather wasn't there to put him in his place
dwy55qp,Kougat,lol
dwy6hx7,Buy-furious,Yeah he could've thrown his wife at him
dwyp90o,Yegs454,"Could've, it still would've beat him"
dwx6dzk,KingAnDrawD,"As much as this dude is a scum bag right now, this whole event just made his stock grow a shit ton. If money is all the UFC cares about, Conor will be back instantly."
dwxu79o,inofucky,At least he'll be able to read the charges.Not like that dumb fucking illiterate retard Floyd Mayweather who can't read worth a shit.
dwxx7x7,EireIsMyLove,"He's a terrible representation of Ireland and I honestly don't like him. As an Irishman, I say he should stay out of the spotlight for a long time, sick of him and his childish behaviour."
dwxzyzt,docterk,I've been wondering if this was an opinion that some held. Do you feel that many other Irishmen feel the same way?
dwy0t6m,EireIsMyLove,"A few would feel that way, especially with this recent incident. The reason is that he loves the spotlight so often he is in the spotlight, and someone like him acting the eejit and causing trouble will sadly create a negative image for Ireland. The reason is that people are stupid, so they'll judge millions of people based on the actions of 1 person or 100 people. When an athlete is representing a country, which he was, they are serving a diplomatic role whether they like it or not, this is why countries take such pride in the Olympics as an example. Some will disagree, but I think he's a poor representation of our people, and whether he likes it or not his status makes him a role model, and he's a shit role model behaving like that. He is just human though, but if he can't control himself, he needs to learn to keep his mouth shut and his nose clean or stay out of the spotlight. I don't know him, so I don't have a personal problem, I do just dislike his behaviour."
dwy57mf,hignz,It's mainly the older generation that does.
dwxayeh,Mirilliux,"This is bad, especially that thug rose was even mildly perturbed by it, but its not Jon Jones bad. Conor manages to commit violence in such a cheeky loveable way that its difficult to stay mad at him."

dwxsee6,theykeepchanging,What was he arrested for?
dwxsx7j,gregiorp,Assault with intent to cause physical injury
dwy5fpp,Kougat,He and 20 of his friends ran up on a bus of UFC fighters that had a fighter he had a beef with and starting throwing chairs through the windows demanding the fighter to come out. That fighter and his crew stepped up on his friend the day before and apparently that was too much disrespect to Mcgregor who is a maniac so he pulled this.A couple of the fighters got hurt from the broke glass as a result.

dwy3i51,Corey307,"It's actually the opposite, a whole lot of people would love to kick his teeth in or put a shank in him for notoriety. In the grand scheme of things he be a little guy with no friends, wouldn't be hard for two or three guys to kick his head in. From what I've gathered the last thing you want to be is famous in jail or prison, you want to blend in."

dwxxrvo,mr_droopy_butthole,Man I'd hate to be the guy they put him in the cell with.
dwy34vr,Corey307,Meh he's a little guy who fights other little guys. He'd get wrecked by any journeyman 205'er and would struggle against any large man with reasonable athleticism. Fighting in a small cell isn't the same as a big cage.
dwy4zj7,mr_droopy_butthole,"> Fighting in a small cell isn't the same as a big cage.I, for one, learned this the hard way."
dwy6h00,Corey307,"Sounds unpleasant, sorry about that."
dwxxyir,MikeAK79,"Why? Trust me, there are plenty of people sitting in a cell right now who could easily make Connor cry. If anything, Connor should be worried about whose in the cell with him."
dwxy21g,mr_droopy_butthole,I disagree with that statement about as hard as I possibly could. He's trained to fight big bad people in very close quarters. He's definitely not a boxer. He's someone who is good at getting in and kicking your ass sans rules and footwork.
dwy3b9i,Corey307,"I agree with you except for the big part, he's 5'9” and maybe 180 lbs. size plays a part in a fight, Conor is going to struggle against larger opponents even if they lack his level of training."
dwy53dm,mr_droopy_butthole,"Bruce lee could knock much larger people out. I've spent many years around shitty people and in that time I've learned not to underestimate people's size. If they are determined, AND skilled, then size means little. Not to say if Conor was jailed with a 6'5” person I would matter but most people in jail are not Hercules and almost none of them are going to be trained in actual martial arts."
dwy6frv,Corey307,"You're right that he is an outlier. His skills and natural talent are top notch among elite athletes and I doubt any regular joe near his size has even a punchers chance. Problem is things change when your opponent has significant size on you. I'm not talking a fat slob, I'm talking a light heavyweight or cruiserweight guy with some experience. Someone who is not going to open with a big shove or bull rush but instead keep their hands up. It's a bitch grappling with someone who has size and strength on you even if they lack trainning. Throw in close confines or weapons and shit get serious for someone who trains in a ring or cage. And I'm editing this because it seems like you're already know what I'm talking about (better than I do) so please don't think I'm lecturing, just talking."
dwxyrny,MikeAK79,You seem to think there are rules in jail. There are no rules. There are no weight classes. It's every man for himself. His training wouldn't do him any favors other than make him a target.
dwxzygo,mr_droopy_butthole,"If he knocked that first dude out, no one else would chance it. I have personally witnessed very small people take down very large people like it wasn't shit. Being big does not make you badass. Being badass makes you badass. Now if he gets stuck with a toothbrush, that's different. But if I had a bet to make and the best was “can Conor destroy his cellmate” before the cellmate is chosen, I'm putting my house down on that shit. If the bet is the same and I can see that the person is 6'5” and 350# and has more teardrops tattooed on his face than teeth in his mouth I might not be so liberal with the bet. But most people in jail are not the latter. Most people in jail (not prison mind you) are not D-Bo. Most people in jail are Smokey and Ezel."
dwy16yd,zedanta,Ur so delusional
dwy4xu9,mr_droopy_butthole,No u
dwy09en,MikeAK79,I can tell you have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to life in jail. You seem to think it's like the local pub or school yard. I suspect you've watched too many Hollywood movies. We'll just have to agree to disagree.

dwx02w4,Bure96,"They don't have to list all charges at this time. They can investigate further before deciding which charges to pursue.

dwy4zd9,whoistruly,Absolutely iconic image.
dwwzocb,sarmasida,Conor 'Prisoner' Mcgregor
dwx66e2,aznassasin,Confirmed to be fake
dwxsmeg,Pantysniffingjew,"I don't shit about mma ......but this Irish fucker is the best salesman I have ever seen, the only person better was Adolph Hitler 😂"
dwy8w24,tenacious_throwaway,This is the only time I've ever wanted to go to jail in New York
dwy9tsa,,[deleted]
dwya2tj,tenacious_throwaway,Going to jail is illegal?
dwz5g2s,Dracuger,"This dude has to transition over to WWE where he can play this drama, raise from a burning coffin if he wants. Seriously it's entertaining but UFC/MMA isn't where this guy belongs."
dwxm5gw,shrewdaddy,Fake news
dwxmrs0,B3_Prof,What is wrong with your brain
dx3p544,shrewdaddy,You dont have enough time for me to answer that
dwxn1xx,route101,He prances around like a leperchaun.
dwy6932,Buy-furious,I don't get it.
dx1akce,route101,He's a fukin douche
dx1gq3j,Buy-furious,But why he leperchaun??
dwxoqtl,jonnysenap3,looks like hampton brandon faggot
dwxpatm,hignz,TTD
dwxwl3e,BentDuck,More proof that MMA is trash
dwy56bv,Buy-furious,That's a strong opinion you got there lad
dwycnlq,fotoX,"Get bent, duck!"
dwx3fdv,JJonesFan,"Faces 2-7 years unless it gets knocked down to a misdemeanor, which given the fact Chiesa was hurt is unlikely. Can definitely plea to lesser, but if pursued, I think Conor spends some time away."
dwx41nu,zrobbo,He will under no circumstance actually do any jail time
dwx4hsv,cajunhawk,Correct...he has way to much money to do time.
dwx6x2b,JJonesFan,"As I wrote, if he pleads down, no. If he wants to go to trial and loses, he will."
dwxif3h,Falcomomo,Obsessed with race in USA...
dwxq12y,Corey307,Hey shithead just about any government form anywhere asks for defining characteristics like race. Even in whatever armpit you live in.
dwxp7a6,,[deleted]
dwxpcnh,Corey307,You notice it's part of a general physical description right? All kinds of government forms ask for race.
dwxppmk,coach_bombay89,Is this a serious question?
dwxpzxy,xRonny7,Why the hell is something like „race“ tracked? What difference does it make if the person is black or white? I don‘t get America sometimes...
dwxr82e,Zazio,I would assume it's to help identify the individual so there is less chance of mistaken identity.
dwy9ovn,Blowinfree,I have a hard time believing this is legit. Just more promotion. Going the wrestling route for dramatic effect.
dwyc879,fotoX,HE GOT ARRESTED. Why do you choose to ignore real life?
dwylbgt,Hugeman33,HE'S GOING TO GET OUT. RICH PEOPLE DON'T GO TO JAIL UNLESS THEY ARE AN EXAMPLE FOR OTHER RICH PEOPLE
dwzbfng,fotoX,He's already out on $50k bail because he's rich and can afford to post. That doesn't mean he won't be convicted in June.
dwx12de,hgf75hd93,The police still uses the pseudo-scientific concept of race? smh.
dwxigsx,GoPrimalRed,You want them to do genetic testing instead?
