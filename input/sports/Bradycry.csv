dvnvugf,I_Upvote_Alice_Eve,I used to mock UGGS until my girlfriend got me a pair. UGGS are the most comfortable fucking footwear on the planet.
dvooplu,outphase84,Wife got me a pair of their slippers 4 or 5 years ago when I started working from home. Best $100 she's ever spent on me.

dvncqt9,sw04ca,"My sister got me some Uggs slippers for Christmas. At first, I wasn't sure how to take it, because they are associated with Tom Brady, a villain. But then I tried them on, and I almost cried too. Those slippers are incredibly warm and comfortable, and the full sole gives you both support and comfort. So I guess this Christmas gift taught me to be a little more empathetic. Just because someone is evil doesn't mean that they don't make excellent footwear choices."
dvoorkg,outphase84,Which ones? My wife got me some 4 or 5 years ago and I love 'em.

dvmy3wp,kjg1228,$5100 for a fucking mattress? I thought I was fancy with my $800 mattress I got at a floor model discount.
dvn1nj5,KingReffots,"I mean we spend a third of our life on them. The mattress market goes way more expensive than $5100 for what it's worth, and I'm just talking upper middle class. For a millionare the sky's the limit."
dvn63p8,Brown_Sandals,"I have a general rule to not cheap out on a mattress because of your first point. With that being said, I am fairly sure you can find an excellent mattress for a fraction of that price."
dvo6hrm,3klipse,"I paid like 1200 for mine,but that was with the $12k my company paid me to move with and again, because we spend so much time over the years in a bed it's worth it"
dvnnmlz,DownvotesForGood,You should spend serious money on everything in your life that separates you from the ground.Mattresses.Shoes.Tires.
dvo22gs,TheElasticTuba,My $10 Walmart shoes do me just fine.
dvo3k1y,DownvotesForGood,Your knees might want to have a talk 10 years from now.
dvo3mlq,TheElasticTuba,"Nah my knees were going to be shitty either way, I'm an actor and a dancer, these things get abused."
dvo5tmg,steampunker13,"I understand dancer, but why actor? What kind of acting are you doing that is detrimental to your knees?"
dvo5x88,TheElasticTuba,"Acting is hella physical. Like for example, in one play I had to fall to my death after being stabbed in the middle of the play. Obviously I can't fall straight back or forwards, as I'd end up actually dead by the time the show closed, so I had to fall directly down onto my knees every night, on a hard wooden stage, like a rock because I was just stabbed. That was over a year ago and I think I still have bruises.Edit: Also for another example I just got done doing a play about the Vietnam War, and I had to portray multiple soldiers and die multiple times, also crawl along the entire stage, etc. As actors we're notorious for finding ways to help minimize damage to our bodies, and yet still fucking up our bodies."
dvo62dq,steampunker13,"Jesus Christ. I never knew, the only acting I did was in the school Christmas play in kindergarten where I played an ornament. I just stood there and had one line."
dvo659d,TheElasticTuba,"There are lovely plays where you don't have to do extreme stuff or die on stage, but at this point I think dying on stage might be a specialty of mine."
dvom76p,preauxtip,"Casket. Wait, you said everything in life."
dvmz375,Brocky70,"I mean, it kind of makes sense that such a speciality mattress would be high end.Honestly i just googled ""black mattress"" out of curiosity. Now i kinda want one"
dvn9qh0,ToMiz9,"It's 1/3rd of your life, worth it IMO ...is what I would say if I had 2-5k laying around"
dvn0eax,mschley2,What the fuck.... Is that made to not have a sheet over it or something? Haha
dvolifk,GulfAg,"Hey that's my mattress... it's comfy as *fuck*. I got mine from a friend that owns a mattress store though, so got a king size that was normally like $4k for $1200. Supposedly the memory foam has crushed up diamonds inside it to keep it cool."
dvmxpzo,bujweiser,"> and makes out with his sonYea, I'm late to the party and just watched that clip on Tom vs. Time...wtf????"
dvmzd3k,Gregus1032,"When i heard it I thought ""oh, it's probably an exaggeration for meme purposes""nope."
dvn4092,bujweiser,"I like the little fakeout smooch where you're like ""oh, that's a little strange, but I guess some parents do that"". Then it doubles back for a full ""wtf, I looked away because I'm uncomfortable, but looked back and they're still smooching."""
dvn2uek,KingReffots,"I mean as a kid I kissed my parent's. I haven't seen the video, but it's just a traditional sorta thing that really was harmless that just comes from a place of love. I'm probably not gonna do it with my kid's though, and I think they stopped doing it before I was 10. Again, I have not seen the video so if he is legitimately making out with his son then that's weird."
dvn3qnf,_Dankenstein_,"Bruuuuuuuh watch that shit and you'll be creeped the fuck out especially when he hits him with the""awww thats just a peck"""
dvn6wv7,thebumm,Link? I'm genuinely curious about the hate/accuracy ratio. I don't like the dude so I just assume anyone that dislikes him might be giving a biased account of the creep factor.
dvn7j6v,420yoloswagblazeit,They hold the kiss for a solid 5 seconds. And it's not like a light hold. There's some force to it. Definitely weird
dvn7puj,thebumm,"On second thought, I'll take your word for it."
dvn9zhx,CoolSteveBrule,Yeah don't look at that. It's weird.
dvn7wuv,badhed,Brady makes the boy participate. The boy immediately wipes his mouth with his shirt.
dvnaihg,_Dankenstein_,Just youtube it i dont have the link i seen it on here it's weird
dvo7ao6,dillardPA,"Oof bud. I really ignored it because I thought it was non-sense, then watched it by happenstance and wow is it bad. Just....incredibly awkward and borderline creepy."
dvn4vpg,Gregus1032,Brady's kid is 9 or 10 I think. I mean a quick kiss isn't horrible. But it just lingers... And lingers... And lingers. That's what's so awkward about it.
dvnwr1c,jellyfungus,"Wait, what? I haven't seen the clip. I thought his kid was a baby and people were blowing it out of proportion. I didn't know his kid was 10."
dvn46n6,DragonzordRanger,"It's an awkward moment between a loving father and an aging sone made much, **much** more awkward by the editing via which the scene opens on a closeup of Tom's bare torso getting rubbed down by a male trainer."
dvn4ylj,mmouchi,"It's not just a cute little peck, it's weirdly intimate in a way that should not be happening between any parent and child."
dvn6qi4,Spankme144,Tom sees it as himself kissing a mini Tom. No one can love Tom as much as Tom
dvn5zak,Blanket215,What was the point of this? Just watch the video
dvnhf2l,KingReffots,I think I replied to the wrong comment.
dvnks81,jamo78338,Nothing that abnormal. When I was younger my uncle and I would wrestle naked and kiss after.

Anyways lol y'all can laugh at me now but can I get that Rodgers link about him talking about seeing a UFO?"
dvo1ewp,Alexander_HamilDong,"I don't have a specific link, but he spoke about it at length on Pete Holmes' podcast ""You made it weird""."

dvnio01,Necrosis_KoC,"TB always sucked too bad to hate when they were in the NFC Central as they didn't get good until they were in the NFCS. Carolina was an expansion team so no one really hated them yet, the Saints and Falcons hated each other as they had been in the same division for awhile and the Bucs were refugees cast aside from the NFCC. Outside of your own division, I doubt they have many haters tbh..."

dvnhmjj,klawehtgod,> send it to me...how?
dvmyfxe,Drikkink,"Again, I rooted for you against pure evil twice. Be happy. You're the only team in division who can hold anything over us for the last 20 years now, unlike the other two."
dvmym8i,Corehamska,You're the evil. Idk what you mean about holding anything over you. The eagles have dominated the giants for a better part of last half decade.
dvmz10g,Drikkink,"Yeah I bet you won those two rings saying ""Well that's great but fuck we couldn't beat Philly""Come on now, the Giants are the only other successful NFC East team this millennium and the fact that they lose to the Eagles in the regular season means shit when they won 2 Rings in spite of it."
dvmztvb,Corehamska,I mean it doesn't detract from the runs but I think you're undervaluing how much the East cares about division rivalries. The miracles at the meadowlands still hurt as much as the rings help.
dvncza7,rasherdk,"I said pre-ring that a Super Bowl win would only barely top the Miracle at the New Meadowlands. People called me crazy and understandably claimed I was just saying it because I'd been there. But here we are, and it's absolutely the case. They were underestimating how much I like beating a division rival in a heartbreaking fashion."

dvnjmkz,needsanewusername,I think the ew refers to the pulling for the Eagles. because of the implication.
dvmz6el,Elfballer,I live in eastern VA where most people are Redskins fans and they kept going on how they wanted the Eagles to win.
dvmthlk,mantiseye,I did no such thing!I'm not happy the Eagles won but I'm also fine with the Pats not winning.
dvmxr9x,WaluigiIsTheRealHero,The Pats hatred is universal. All the Giants fans I know were either rooting for the Eagles or for a meteor to hit the stadium.

dvn7nh6,walkingcarpet23,"My brother (Cowboys fan) wasn't cheering for either team, he just wanted an entertaining game and viewed a win either way as an undesirable result. Overall he was ok with it.My friend (Redskins fan) was doing some fantasy football challenge where you can only use each player once. Due to expecting the Eagles to lose out he'd played the wrong people, and in the superbowl he was left with Foles, Ertz, Clement and a couple other Eagles.He was a happy man lol"

dvn6ldu,Hesi_Pull-up_Timbo,"Former Cowboys fan here, you bet your buns I'd root for anyone over Tom Brady."
dvnr9dw,mylermaker,What caused you to see the light?
dvnsyyh,Hesi_Pull-up_Timbo,"TL;DR: Sixers fan knows Jerry Jones will never hire a good coach, still loves Romo dearly1. I'm a Philly native who now goes to the University of Oklahoma, so my appreciation for my home town has drastically increased2. I've become a huge Sixers fan3. After re-discovering this year that Jason Garrett is a weak willed, limp-dicked purse dog for Jerry Jones who did NOT deserve coach of the year in 2016, I realized that after Jimmy Johnson, Jones will never hire a strong coach who will take control of the team. Jones will also never sell the team, because it's the most valuable sports franchise on the planet. So if those two are true, I'll have to wait out Jerry Jones' death to have a chance to see the cowboys make a deep playoff run without the miracle player health and performance that lead to our 2014 and 2016 runs. Yeah I'd want to see the Boys do well, but I don't want Jerry Jones kissing the trophy as if his ownership hadn't hindered the success of the team for the past 20 years.In the end, I will always root for Dak and Zeke and Dez and Sean Lee. I'll ESPECIALLY always root for Witten and claim Romo as my favorite player ever, because I grew up watching those two take it to the NFCE (in the words of Phife Dawg [RIP] ""I tell ya that's vision; like Tony Romo when he's hittin' Witten"").Maybe I won't actually give it up. Who knows. But I've certainly given up paying attention to the Cowboys since we blew a chance at the playoffs."
dvmsqu2,MrGreggle,I fucking hated both teams. Didn't even watch the Super Bowl. All the joy I can derive from the season is based on shitting on the loser.

dvmvs9a,lilmigosvert,for a major city it's definitely the most racist

dvmycpt,Derstilweedndat,"I said credible. First of all I think you're exaggerating. If there are athletes having racial slurs hurled at them ""every time they go to Boston"" then there must be an article or a tweet to prove that so maybe you could provide some context for your claim? Now I'm not going to pretend that it hasn't happened, I already acknowledged a fairly high profile instance of this happening with Adam Jones. On your end however for the sake of fairness you need to acknowledge Fenways response to this incident and their behavior towards Adam Jones the next time he played there. You can't fairly make claims like that and label Boston something so heinous while ignoring the other side of the equation. It would be ignorant and stupid of me to claim that it never happens but it's ignorant and stupid of you to make the claims you have with literally no sources, it just comes off as something you're saying and that you believe so you speak it as truth. So like I said do you have anything credible or is the 16 year old Reddit brigade going to decide for themselves that Boston is ""the most racist sports city in America"" and then down vote me because I say otherwise or at the very least ask you to provide CREDIBLE context for your claim. Not ""uhh yeah some guys said it happened and things like that"". That shit ain't credible."

We drove there, and we all decided we'd go out to dinner together. Tom being who he was, he usually couldn't come to a team event like that. We might be at Capital Grille and he is sneaking in the back door and then people realize he's there and he has to leave. But this was impromptu at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Rochester. The whole team is there. And it turns into a beer-chugging contest. You have linemen, Julian Edelman, they all think they are going to win. Then someone says, 'I heard Tom is really great at chugging a beer.' We don't usually get to experience him like this, but we finally coax him into doing it. He does it, and let me tell you, you couldn't have poured out the beer faster into a glass. It was unbelievable. And he slams the mug on the table and puts both fists in the air. He walks away with a look on his face that said, 'You really thought you were going to beat me on this?' The place went nuts."""

They way he turns, half-smiles, and says ""Let's try!""....it makes me genuinely uncomfortable."
dvmzh8g,JimmyStinkfist,He's got serious Tom Cruise vibes.
dvn0hta,moldy_cake,"I could see a sequel to American Psycho (not counting the sequel that already exists) where the main character has made it into the national spot light as a highly successful star quarterback, being touted as the greatest player of all time. He has a very rigid workout routine each morning. He spends time in his office listening to his music, not taking calls, pretending to be talking to others who are very important. All the while, a dark, sinister side is brewing. Sure, he threw for 372 yards on Sunday at home, and the city is going nuts over the fantastic victory against a hated rival. Some little mini-riots are going on, nothing too intense, but just enough to draw all police attention elsewhere. And that's when he strikes. He's just cruising around a shadier side of town. No one would ever mess with him, and anyone who saw him wouldn't believe it's really him, anyway. He pulls off next to a bank, parks and locks his car as he begins a stroll through the alleyways. He takes the long way around. He knows these streets well, having grown up only a few blocks from here. He had time to learn every little nook and cranny. Ah, a homeless man. Just what he was waiting for. So her does a little murder, and back into his car he goes. It starts off as a few homeless men dying in the streets, then maybe a prostitute winds up missing, they never find her. All the while this star QB has all of these media appearances, major football games, excessive training sessions. Everyone in the locker room knows that he's always working, and so they know when he has his off time to not bother him. His off time only comes but 4 or 5 times during the regular season. It's during these times that he can be himself. Anyways, I think Tom Brady is a serial killer."

dvn0hit,POGtastic,Bernard Pollard: Blade Runner.

dvn1pj5,overthemountain,That's a good reason to not have eaten a strawberry in the past 20 years or so. I refuse to believe that he never had a strawberry growing up. He seemed to have a pretty normal life (relatively speaking) until sometime after he went pro.
dvn7qbl,AnotherUnfunnyName,He said he didn't like the smell.
dvn75lz,thebumm,I'm most curious about strawberries in stuff like jam or ice cream. I know a few people that didn't get/eat fresh fruits really growing up outside of apples or oranges and fresh veggies limited to bagged salad or carrots and celery sticks. So if gen hates the smell I can see him being a picky eater and never buying them or ordering something with them at a restaurant. But who hasn't had at least one pb & j with strawberry jam?
dvne41p,shinypenny01,"That doesn't count as eating a strawberry, surely?"
dvnogzm,thebumm,"Most jams, and a lot of strawberry ice creams and desserts have chunks of strawberry. My point being, it'd be insanely strange if he had never, ever eaten one in any form. Like, nearly impossible. And if he did, his claim is false. And if he didn't, I want to know how."
dvodo9x,jackw_,> But who hasn't had at least one pb & j with strawberry jam?Dude this is way more rare than just eating an actual strawberry lol
dvn8yb1,junkit33,"He doesn't like the smell of strawberries.While an odd food to not like the smell of, it's certainly not an odd concept for a kid to not like the smell of a food and thus refuse to ever try it. Not crazy that it just carried on through adulthood - like every one of his meals is hand-crafted with exact ingredients anyway, so it's not hard to just avoid strawberries.I'm sure it's real, because strawberries are actually a very healthy anti-inflammatory food, which is what Brady is generally all about in his diet. So he must really not like the smell of them."
dvnji1j,bestmaleperformance,"> has some weird beliefs If he hadn't married the world's biggest supermodel, made a hundred million dollars and won 5 superbowl rings coming into the NFL looking as athletic as me at 12 years old on a daily diet of doritos and root beer, I'd agree, but I'm starting to think it's the rest of us that have weird beliefs and he's fucking totally dialed in."

dvn5oi7,Keith_Creeper,"I had a friend that hadn't ever eaten a strawberry (to his knowledge) by the age of 29. So one evening we got him to try one. He took a bite and said, ""Not to exciting, really"". Didn't even finish the thing, just the one bite. His regular meals consisted of the blandest foods; Rice, mashed potatoes, steak, chicken, hamburger sans mustard or ketchup... motherfucker is a damn chef, too! He makes others in the kitchen test the food before he sends it out because, ""How the hell would I know what it's supposed to taste like, I dont eat this stuff."""

dvoecs6,SmokinBae,"no dude, it's way fucking better to sit while peeing... People are just so used to standing when peeing in public, and the sub-text of 'only girls sit when peeing' (For idiots), that it is relatively uncommon to actually think to sit when peeing as a guy. But when you do, oh man. You'll never go back when you are at home and not in a rush to pee like you are when playing video games all day."

dvn8b1p,get_out_of_town,I forgot how bananas this show is.
dvmu4zu,SuddenlyTheBatman,"[For You](https://imgur.com/a/9fQOl) I just found this trying to look for something else but while I think there may be a better time to unleash it for karma, I also feel it's in better hands with Bills fans. My gift to you."
dvmsuru,zachwilson23,"Yeah, he's probably gonna get blasted on here, but who wouldn't have cried after the kind of game he had and coming up short? I don't understand judging or criticizing someone for how they respond to a big loss like this"
dvmt7c7,dezholling,I don't think anyone is likely to judge or criticize Brady for this. People just naturally hate teams and players that win all the time and so this news gives them a schadenfreude boner.
dvmtt1i,TrikKastral,"It's too bad, the interview is pretty entertaining, most people will just focus on the headlines which is the least surprising part."
dvmw2jz,jkopplin,I won't criticize him for crying. But I will criticize him for failing to shake hands after every Super Bowl he's lost but being out there ready to glad hand after every championship he's won. Learn to be a good sport.
dvn2hkl,Prom000,"Dude shaked other players hands, thought."
dvn4h70,jetpack_operation,Prepare for the goalpost to mo---and there it goes.
dvn4tc6,jkopplin,As far as I know he left the field without shaking hands after both losses to the Giants and the loss against the Eagles.OK I'm being downvoted but [here's the article](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/02/05/tom-brady-didnt-shake-hands-nick-foles-super-bowl-lii-bad-sport-congratulations/). Brady snubbed Foles and there's no record of him shaking hands with Eli after either loss. But both Ryan and Wilson managed to find Brady and shake hands with him after their losses to the Pats in the Super Bowl.
dvolblq,psychosus,"Kurt Warner didn't shake hands with Brady. Both Manning and Wayne didn't stay to shake hands after losing to the Saints, either."
dvmxrdg,BoringPersonAMA,"This was pretty well explained and I don't blame him for it anymore. The field of the Superbowl is instantly flooded after the game ends. I can't imagine trying to find a single person in a football field packed with people, let alone fighting through the biggest crowd to get to the winning qb. It would be easier for Tom than some random guy, obviously, but I do get it."
dvn1rku,Ozwaldo,"Weird, plenty of other QBs have lost the Superbowl and still had the good sportsmanship to do it..."
dvn1hxg,IndiscreetMath,"Bullshit. He had an NFL PR and NFL security guy shepherding him around, and Nick Foles did too. If he really wanted to they could have found each other."
dvmzf18,zachwilson23,I agree with that. Cam Newton is upset after losing the Superbowl and everyone freaks out and he's a terrible sport.Brady or Manning don't shake hands or congratulate the other team after the Superbowl and nobody says anything
dvofh9c,allgood2386,"Well no one is docking him a pick for being generally aware, so it all evens out imo.PS. Tim Brady got a lot of hate in this sub for the no hand shake. You are discussing it right now 2 months later."
dvmwzml,jiogrtaejiogreta,You think it's bad mannered not to shake when you lose and think it's less bad mannered to do so if you also snub people when you beat them? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
dvmy00d,AranaDiscoteca88,"Yes. This. He has a reputation for being a bad sport. How many times have we seen him pouting on the field or sideline after throwing an INT, or after a play goes sideways? Win with grace, lose with dignity."
dvmzp33,sanekidinacrazyworld,"Every QB in this league is pissed off about throwing interceptions besides for Cutler. How do you want him to react? Give everyone a high five after he throws an interception? Everyone would shit on him for that too. No matter what he does, people shit on him for it. He could save a baby from a house burning down and somebody will still say some shit about him."
dvmzulk,AranaDiscoteca88,"Sure, be pissed. But don't sit on the field with your head hung. Get up, let out an expletive, and go figure out how not to do it again."
dvn0fc4,HookersForDahl2017,After he throws picks he usually is looking at the ipad with McDaniels. He doesn't sit there and sulk until he goes back in.
dvn6gzd,CochaFlakaFlame,"Obviously that would be ideal, but you're really underestimating the level of emotion that comes into play when the sport is nationally broadcasted and the expectations placed upon Brady are about as high as can be."
dvmw3y5,,I wouldn't cry. Only time I cry is when something terrible happens to someone I care about. Not when I lose a game.

dvmtnb0,Rosco_Black,He said Brady not Wilson
dvmu0t0,TheShmud,"""go Hawks""-Wilson-bot-*Michael Scott*"
dvmyvwe,PM_ME_YOUR_RHINO,"Speaking of Wilson, I remember when he was being interviewed after *the NFCCG game against the ~~Rams~~ Packers*(~~pretty sure it was a~~ last minute comeback win for us) and he was so emotional and had tears streaming down his face, trying to praise God and talk about what just happened.And right after that they showed a shot of a players prayer circle (I think its quite a regular thing between Christian players in the league) and as he was kneeling, he was still sobbing, made me cry pretty hard.Edit: It was the other way round, prayer circle first and then the interview, my bad."

dvmuggg,Charod48,"Yeah, with the context this sounds more like a joke."
dvn4wpj,RisherdMarglus,It was 100% a joke by an athlete on a talk show trying to be funny.
dvn0hbw,millsmillsmills,"Don't worry, nobody will care about context here."
dvn0qlo,analogWeapon,"Either way, I'd respect him. It's not like he's crying instead of doing his job. Humans have emotions."
dvmvnux,rsoxguy12,"The real headline is that Brady chugged a beer in one gulp against Colbert and proceeded to eat a strawberry (GASP). But nope, /r/nfl needs its weekly Pats schadenfreude.EDIT - Beer video: https://twitter.com/colbertlateshow/status/973365839683502080?s=21Strawberry video: https://twitter.com/AndrewHarts/status/973413582800084992"

dvmyd92,Serotogenesis,"Damn, that's an impressive chug."
dvmyl3b,Drikkink,"If I remember right, there were stories within a week of the game saying he cried."
dvmzik7,5FingerDeathTickle,"I mean, he looked like he was about to cry during the whole 4th quarter."
dvn1tvt,MRCHalifax,"“Ha! You failed to be repeat Super Bowl winners, despite your ageless QB having one of the best games of all time! *Got ‘em.*”"
dvn5kjb,mmouchi,"Still lost, that means Brady is a loser forever unless he wins another Superbowl.E: Sarcasm sure is lost on this sub"
dvn2olo,Prom000,No why did He eat the strawberry! Dynasty over!
dvnr0jg,BobSacamano47,I also wake up after super bowl losses and ask myself if it was a nightmare. Anyone else?
dvmuuks,MrG,Can't win them all? Montana would like a word with Brady.
dvmvz1p,DukeWayne250,Can't win the Superbowl if you don't make it to the Superbowl
dvmw30b,YoureTheTrashMan,Brady's winning percentage is much higher than Montana's
dvmw8vb,MrG,Montana is 4-0 in the SuperBowl.
dvmxc91,PerfectZeong,Yeah but then there were all those years he didn't get there.
dvmxcud,YoureTheTrashMan,Shame he couldn't get there more than 4 times.. he mightve got more than 4 rings

dvmubo4,CoMaBlaCK,"I used to cry uncontrollably win or lose after high school games and I couldn't figure out why.Looking back at it I guess it's because you spend so much time preparing, then playing and then it's over. That was just for bs high school games I couldn't imagine a super bowl."
dvn859a,Acidsparx,I cried my last game. Something the coach said about how this will be the last time most of us played the sport etc.
dvn9d1s,CoMaBlaCK,"I cried as I did every game for that one but my coach heard me say something to a junior and that stuck with him for awhile he told me.Before my last game the junior said ‘oh I bet you're happy it's over after today' and I told him I wish I had 10 more games. I guess it showed the difference between mindsets, going to camp, going to practice, being up early every day, they're all chores until you realize you won't be able to do them anymore. When it comes to Brady I know better than to think this is his last crack at the super bowl but after the stress of the season, the playoffs and coming home empty handed it's crushing, also somewhere in his mind he has to consider that it's a possibility that's his last chance to win it."

dvmvcxy,TrikKastral,The fact that it's not uncommon at all for people with different upbringings. Implying that it's something other than that is anything but funny.

dvmt52x,rawkhawk12,He lead a comeback down 28-3 in the super bowl to get his fifth ring. Did you know?!
dvmtaxq,guitar_vigilante,"No, he was too distracted by the Indians losing after being up 3-1 in the World Series."
dvmxq67,modelbillionaireceo,And Joe montana won 55-10. And also it's cause he played like shit for a solid half. Wouldn't be 28-3 if he didn't play like shit for half the game. Plus he lucked out that matty ice somehow only scored 21 points the entire game
dvn3eue,Prom000,5 is more then 4. 8 is more then. 4.
dvmxjxu,ScarySloop,You ain't wrong.Joe Montana still the GOAT.
dvn3fa7,Prom000,Why?
dvmsvbq,decimalsanddollars,"You're right, it wasn't luck. It was mostly BB's system."
dvmszg0,rawkhawk12,Buffalo Bills' system? Of what? Being terrible?
dvmt5vc,decimalsanddollars,BB is Bill Belichick.Brady being a system qb is a meme.This is a brady hate thread. Try to keep up.
dvmtsma,rawkhawk12,I'm not the one who needs an explanation.
dvmtguk,lilmigosvert,"nah mate, unfortunately pats fans got to the thread, now it's back to regularly scheduled brady jerking"
dvmtqr2,rawkhawk12,Not a Pats fan but I'm also not a hater.
dvmtiwx,decimalsanddollars,Ill eat the downvotes. I thought it was funny.
dvmtpe6,OftenHyperbolic,i always wonder if the system QB people really believe it though?
dvmtw8r,decimalsanddollars,I doubt it. Anybody that doesn't think TB is at least one of the GOATS if not THE GOAT isnt being honest with themself.
dvmtsvn,lilmigosvert,no but you're out of your mind if you don't think being on Bill's team hasn't significantly aided Brady in his career
dvmu1nb,rawkhawk12,and you're out of your mind if you think having Tom Brady hasn't significantly aided Bill's careerBoth are legends for a reason
dvmwcva,OftenHyperbolic,Brady has helped Belichick much more than the other way around.
dvmxr3r,lilmigosvert,how can people be this delusional lmfao do you really think the Pats wouldn't win 5+ rings with Rodgers or Manning instead of Brady?
dvmzedy,OftenHyperbolic,oh yeah...5 rings...no problem...nothing to that. Easy.And I'm delusional?
dvmzhpt,lilmigosvert,"What the fuck?None of what you said has literally anything to do with what you said orginally. Yes, Brady has 5 rings. Bill has 7. How does that mean that Brady has helped Belichick more than Belichick has helped Brady"
dvn1c67,OftenHyperbolic,Bill Belichick is a fat dude who sits on the sidelines.Name me his notable playoff wins as a HC without Brady as his QB...He's a below .500 HC without Brady...I like how you threw in those 2 SBs he won as a coordinator...of a defense...Any good players on that defense??? Hmmmm.....
dvn1hec,lilmigosvert,> Bill Belichick is a fat dude who sits on the sidelines.Yeah we're done hereI'm actually crying
dvn1li3,OftenHyperbolic,"point is...he's never made a throw, or a tackle.You act like he has some magic spell that makes Brady a great player...funny how that magic doesn't work on any other players..."
dvn1r48,lilmigosvert,"Yeah, he doesn't make throws, or tackles.Instead he diagrams defenses that have been top 10 in scoring in 15 of the last 18 years.Instead he game plans better than any other coach in the history of the NFLInstead he makes the best adjustments in the league by a mileInstead he helped develop Tom from a 6th round rookie who would have flamed out in a couple of years without himInstead he also helps diagram the offense as well and has created the offense to fit his version of an NFL offenseInstead he's also the fucking GM of the Patriots too and has drafted better than anyone else by a mile and has found hidden talent better than anyone else, ever, by far"
dvn25wn,OftenHyperbolic,"you don't understand football...diagrams?Brady flames out without him?""Instead he also helps diagram the offense as well and has created the offense to fit his version of an NFL offense""-This sentence should go down history as the dumbest and most nonsensical sentence ever.The Pats haven't drafted that amazingly...basically all their first round picks have been busts...How good was his defensive coaching in the Super Bowl?Brady and McDaniels run the Pats offense, and everyone knows that.Ill educate you, you dummy...watch the first play of this highlight...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5JgUbNadWk&t=7slook how calm Brady is in the face of pressure...look at where Burkhead is when Brady throws the ball...his anticipation and poise is the best ever...but no, you are right...all Belichick."
dvn0v0c,HookersForDahl2017,"Manning would never win 5 rings. He was better at losing in the first round of the playoffs. Rodgers you could probably make a case for it, but it's pointless to have this argument."
dvnj8ul,OriginalKayos,"You're right, he didn't become the GOAT by luck. He is referenced to as the GOAT because of people forgetting he rode 3/5 of his SB wins on Adam Vinatieri's foot and the other 2 on horrible play calls by the other team failing to make logical play calls and the Pats defense dominating."
dvnqc2t,rawkhawk12,My God the salt!
dvonvsf,psychosus,"You *do* know that the Eagles were trailing by 10 points in SB39, right? The last points from the Pats were a FG by Vinatieri with 8:43 left in the 4th. We got the ball back twice afterward from an INT and a recovered on-side kick. We sealed the game with McNabb's 3rd pick.Jesus, it's like you didn't even watch the game."
dvmqygc,ihd311,Me too dawg
dvmr585,dubbed4lyfe,"I'm not sure about most people, but i was much less upset about this loss than the other losses"
dvmruib,branchness,Same. This was the easiest Pats SB loss to deal with — including 96.
dvnba5q,Rednaz1,That's just because the others were about as bad as could be. If this SB loss existed in a vacuum it would be looked at very differently due to all the Butler stuff. But yeah I wasn't too upset
dvmse4m,chowda_head,"I feel the same. The Eagles played a better game and deserved to win. Hard to get to emotional when your team gets outplayed. If, say, there was some fluky play that led to the opposing team winning I would've been far more upset."
dvmudgk,Darko33,"Not trying to rub things in at all, but this was exactly how I had always hoped we'd win our first -- not against a weaker opponent, not on some fluke play or lucky break, but beating the GOAT and a world-class team in an exciting game that featured tons of huge plays."
dvmwl0r,chrisrobweeks,"Respect. We had our flaws and they were all exposed that night. It's the same reason I appreciate our first win so much more than the others - against all odds, we bested the Greatest Show on Turf."
dvmzysw,smoketheevilpipe,"That was actually the last time I pulled for the pats. I hated the rams back in the day. Love Kurt Warner, but i hated the rams."
dvmztbi,notParticularlyAnony,"i hate to say it, it kills me inside, but the coaching, the gameplan was masterful. it was a great game.coulda done without that strip sack"
dvn04oy,Eggsavore,Yea I would have preferred to not have my heart ripped out my chest on that strip sack.
dvmwk2j,ViolentAmbassador,"I felt that way at first, but the whole Butler fiasco has rubbed me the wrong way and I'm actually more upset about the loss now than I was right after the game."
dvmrkrn,2HandedMonster,As if most of the Pats fans on here were fans for most of the wins and lossesI bet most couldnt even tell you who like Leigh Bodden is without googling it
dvmrq18,Bobby_Newpooort,"Thank you, wise gatekeeper. For only true Pats fans will remember a mediocre veteran CB from possibly the worst Pats defense in this era"
dvms2l4,Scrubsisalright,I wonder how many of this new wave of Eagles fans even know who Joe Bukant is without googling him
dvmrxuv,2HandedMonster,"I had one guy tell me ""Ty Law aint shit"" because he assumed I was talking about a player from another team"
dvms8i6,Clevesteamer829,Did you fight him?
dvmwpbh,chrisrobweeks,One guy is definitely representative of an entire fanbase.
dvmwmvz,chrisrobweeks,*yawn* tired rhetoric is tired
dvmr30f,MikeDieselKamehameha,Now you know how Falcons fans felt.
dvmr6fv,RandyMarshStansDad,Not even close
dvmrops,lilmigosvert,nobody cried. you don't cry when your soul gets torn into tiny shreds and thrown into a garbage compactor. a piece of all of us died that day and we will never get it back. a gaping hole in our psyche that ends up being a part of you
dvms33t,MugiMartin,"I know you enjoyed this year's Super Bowl. I remember seeing you in the ALDS thread when the Red Sox got eliminated. Yup, I remembered that shit."
dvms75y,lilmigosvert,uh i don't think it was me but maybe lol

dvn0m79,lilmigosvert,it just wasn't a smooch
dvn0bqx,Eggsavore,What the fuck is the matter with you?
dvmvipi,lmHavoc,"So he french kissed his son and then hooked up with him? You seem to be the leading expert on what goes on with Brady, so clearly you must know all the details. https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/844unx/tom_brady_says_he_cried_after_super_bowl_loss_to/dvmsie7/"
dvmt3eg,jaeway,Was he naked?
dvmvybx,c4boom13,He also didn't french kiss him.
dvmtcf7,lilmigosvert,he was getting massaged and had a towel around his junk. he might have been wearing pants but still
dvnvwvz,badhed,When he began harrassing a boy for some lingering lip action.
dvmra23,826836,... okay? Person who loses big game is upset about it.How is this remotely notable?
dvmu6cd,TheShmud,It's not. But he did finally have his first strawberry and that is notable
dvmra13,JohnDRuckerduck,We may have won but this is Tom fucking Brady. He's the GOAT. Doesn't change a damn thing about him from my perspective.
dvmqymp,Jordan413,I'm glad his son was there to kiss it better
dvms5qb,HowiDisappear,Ok I'm out of the loop. What's with Tom Brady and his son?
dvmsie7,lilmigosvert,he hooked up with his son on camera
dvmtuh8,barrysmothers,BB did it too after SB49. I don't know what's up with these guys.
dvmvlqn,hadesscion,I think it's a Boston thing.
dvo28nx,mr_schneebley,"Tom Brady is from Northern California and Bill Belichick is from the South. I'll add Brady doesn't act anything like a New Englander. From accent, to the way he talks, to his mannerisms you can tell he is 100% a Northern California boy."
dvn3y0q,barrysmothers,I think it's a foreigner thing. BB is Croatian and Brady has a very Brazilian wife.
dvmt1ok,jaeway,"In the time vs time documentary(?) he kissed his son on the mouth. Like you would kiss your girlfriend. Kind of weird I guess, but honestly it wasn't that bad. Just some affection between father and son"
dvmthv1,TrikKastral,Your girlfriend must be very unhappy.

dvmx9x2,hadesscion,Some days I'm not so sure.
dvmxbx4,PornFilterRefugee,You only need to look at literally any thread about Brady to see how delusional that is
dvmxte6,lilmigosvert,every single brady thread is nonstop brady rainy licking. even non-Pats threads are somehow made to be about the pats
dvmxhtp,hadesscion,It seems to me that most Pats game threads are overwhelmingly pro-Brady.
dvmxxfd,modelbillionaireceo,There really are. Pats fans constantly get up votes for typical Patriots fan narratives like claiming Brady is the goat
dvmtuis,lilmigosvert,"yeah, they are"
dvmyj5m,morosco,It seems so exhausting and depressing to hate a sports team. Like it just consumes your your perspective on things. And it just makes you a dick to people based on where they grew up and what team they happen to root for. I'm so glad I let that go when I was like 8. Good luck with it though!
dvn584k,MrGreggle,Brady is a bitch and a cheater.
dvn7gyq,morosco,"Maybe, but I had nothing to do with anything the Patriots or Brady did or didn't do. Just like you're not in control of the fact that your team's name is a racial slur, or the racist legacy of George Marshall. We're all just football fans. Some of us (like you) are just dicks to people if they root for the wrong team and try to impose moral blame on them. I don't get the mentality, I was always able to be friends with Lakers and Yankees fans at the height of those rivalries with my teams, and I thought their great players were awesome. (I was a weirdo Celtics fan who loved both Bird and Magic.)The most fascinating side-effect of the Patriots dynasty, after about 3 decades of fandom where my teams didn't win all that much, is how people are suddenly dicks to you for no other reason than the team you root for. And how losers will project sad and weird sports team hate any chance they get."
dvmr9hk,Yeah_Okay_Sure,I mean I cried after the Super Bowl too so no shade from me.
dvmruol,throwaway77783883838,Can't wait to see how many people in this thread bring up the time Brady committed all 7 deadly sins and 744774747 felonies when he didn't shake Foles hand after the game.

dvn65yu,lispychicken,"We're a smarter team than Minn, especially with 2 weeks to plan. Our secondary mish mash of players who had low season experience was our downfall. We missed regulation tackles and allowed plays to happen that the damn Browns would've stopped"

dvmzh47,4262,"Philly's defense was worse (minus the fumble play obviously) tbh. Neither one was about much, but I definitely saw more straight up blown coverages and guys running wide open when New England had the ball. NE got no pressure all game, but a lot of the throws Foles made were just perfectly placed in tight windows."
dvn5xy4,lispychicken,"Philly played the GOAT, they were not going to stop him.NE put together some sort of backyard football secondary that couldn't tackle a 3yr old in a phonebooth. Billy B's bravado not having Butler play was his SB downfall."

dvmr59c,,Nick Foles was in there to lick his salty tears
dvmvsh6,hadesscion,Nick Foles = Brady's son?
dvmrcsb,TigerCharades3,Did he also get his legs awkwardly massaged by some goofy dude afterwards or?
dvmrwxq,WigglestonTheFourth,Think of the money he could have raised for cancer research if he bottled the tears and sold them.
dvmsw1k,highnote14,This just in: Tom Brady is a competitor. More at 11.
dvmyl1p,AndyEternity,This just in: Tom Brady also cries when sitting down to pee!
dvmr68n,tytrim89,Like a baby back bitch

dvnkop4,Swishmaster2002,If you lost the super bowl you would be very sad and would most likely cry. I am not a fan of Brady but he has a right to cry and not get judged here.
dvnkuwu,PoppaSauce,"my judgement of him was way before this superbowl, but your right losing the SB would hurt."

dvmu3ch,kreachr,How do people that hate the Patriots read this stuff and laugh and think it's great? This type of response is exactly what makes him as great as he is. The guy is upset that he didn't win a _sixth_ Super Bowl.
dvmvqxe,hadesscion,That's like a billionaire complaining that he didn't make another million.
dvn3of7,iHeartGreyGoose,Except Brady isn't complaining.

dvms9w7,julio-jones,Starting QBs should act stout and honorable. Not be upset and *whine* or look bitter in front of the media.

dvmrkvy,thekevmaester,"Yeah, youre not gonna fade to irrelevance like the 2015 Broncos, 2013 Seahawks. You have a great defense you keep you going, unlike .....wait."
dvmtwyd,LeClassiqueHomme,It's so weird seeing eagles fans acting all high and mighty
dvmw6b9,DrDudeManJones,"Eh, we also have a great, balanced offense and a franchise QB. Our defense didn't win us the Super Bowl (other than the strip sack). Did you forget how many yards both teams put up?You need to call out one of my fellow Eagles fans who is being an Asshole, fine. But we're not fading into irrelevance."
dvmx3rn,thekevmaester,"No, of course not..."
dvo4clq,2HandedMonster,Your comparisons are awful
dvmslmj,lilmigosvert,pats fans can't say shit about fading to irrelevance when brady is gone 95% of your fan base will go too

dvn5hq0,NwahsNworB,Brady could have 8 rings
dvn909m,,Could easily only have 1 too.
dvn5x5t,ProBluntRoller,If Asante samuels could catchIf welker could catchIf belichick didn't go full heel during the super bowl
dvn64xr,Jtang6031,If the Falcons and Seahawks didn't choke like babies tho....
dvn679n,ProBluntRoller,Seahawks only had a chance because of a miracle catch tho
dvn69z6,Jtang6031,"Yeah well it seems like people have miracle catches in the SB. (Edelman, Holmes, Tyree, etc.)"
dvo46re,2HandedMonster,If only Brady didnt throw multiple INTs and caused a safety and threw on target to Welker If only they could have scored more than 14 when they had averaged 36If only Brady doesnt fumble the ball and takes the easy pass to the flat
dvoda1f,ProBluntRoller,I'll fight you right now if you try to tell me that welker pass wasn't catchable
dvndg36,KingEdTheMagnificent,TIL I have exactly 2 things in common with Tom Brady. We both cry after SB losses and we both have resided in the greater Boston area at one point or another.
dvo955k,jared2294,"No surprise, he's one of the most emotional players I've ever seen. Love him."

dvmtt96,morosco,"If he didn't care about the outcome of the games anymore, he'd probably be retired by now. He certainly wouldn't be as successful."
dvmuh15,MisterPhamtastic,"I don't think I ever implied that, aspiring for continued dominance is a must in being a man and winning in sports/life.Just at the end of the day he's already achieved x, which trumps 99.99% of the planet in achievements. No shame in coming up short at this stage. It's all icing on the cake from here."
dvmwlpe,morosco,"I may have misunderstood, it sounded like you were doubting he was really upset by the loss - reading again, maybe you're just saying you don't feel bad for him (which is quite understandable)."
dvmzrpn,MisterPhamtastic,"I don't feel bad for him at all, because he shouldn't feel bad. Guy wins at life."
dvmsrsg,Wissahickon,"i'm sure it still hurts, especially losing because he was strip sacked."
