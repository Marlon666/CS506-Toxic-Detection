Finding a ""zero-day"" (new attack) is impressive stuff.* > A subset of Sakula variants are digitally signed, allowing them to bypass security controls and providing users with a false sense of security that the software is legitimate. **Translation: The author(s) of Sakula *also* exploited a cryptography flaw.** This exploit allows the malware to trick your computer into thinking that the malware is an official update.

dvyvg4b,"Back 10 years ago or so, I noticed that the value of Dell Computer was varying a bit. Using Michael Dell's number of shares, I figured out that his net worth was jumping up and down by millions every few minutes, hundreds of millions in an hour or day.I pondered how that would affect one's perspective. It seemed to me that the concepts of net worth and the value of one's time just completely falls apart in that situation. For example, one could take a dump and lose - or gain - $5,000,000 before you wipe. The numbers just don't make any sense any more.All you can do is abstract yourself from the equation, and just see what you can do to improve the value of the company, and leave it better off than you found it. And, from talking to real 'old money' people, in fact that turns out to be the key. If the fifth generation (yes, that long) accepts the fact that they don't own the money/assets, the money/assets own you, and you are just the custodian for a decade or two, then your family are on the way to 'old money'. It's no longer about the toys and parties, it's about taking care of something that has lived for a century, and will (if not screwed up) live for another century or 10, producing goods or making life better for everyone.Cases in point: as of a couple of decades ago, the Twining family still owned Twining teas, after over 250 years.

dw02o4h,"I think this view is misguided for a few reasons:1. The value an employee generates when part of a company can be greater than the value of that same effort solo. If you're really good at riveting, you can probably generate more value combining forces with other talents to build airplanes than you can with random freelance riveting work, even if you expend the same effort in each job.2. Organizing a production effort is itself a big job, and companies need to make profits to pay for overhead. This overhead is essential to production, not dependent on financial system.3. Furthermore, deciding where to invest production effort is also a big job. I'm guessing this is where you feel capitalism is exploitative, because the mechanism we use to pay people for this job is giving them a return on good investments. This looks like getting paid for nothing except ""being good at capitalism"", but again the job of choosing how to invest production effort exists independent of financial system, and this is capitalism's method for rewarding that job.So of course I agree that capitalism can be exploitative, as can any system when abused. I don't think, eg, American capitalism is a eutopia, and obviously many people are being compensated disproportionately to their job. However, there are also many good companies that run things right, and switching financial systems doesn't solve the problem of bad actors trying to exploit the system.Edit: To summarize, you're saying capitalism is inherently exploitative. I'm saying I don't think that's true, but it is *exploitable*.

dw0ltzv,"Good points.I'll just add, that having your money - or your company - in a low tax situation makes a huge difference on growth. High taxes are a huge drag on growth.For instance, let's say you start out with $1000. if you have $100 in profit, and that is taxed at 35%, you actually have $65 to invest in growth. If you are taxed at 5%, you have $95 to invest. Assume you continue in a linear fashion, after 10 years you will have $1,877 or $2478 respectively. If it's in a tax-free account, even better - $2594. And if you are taxed at 60%, after 10 years you'll only have $1480.This also reminds me - if you are putting your money in good places, money saved in your 20s can be worth 8 to 10 times as much as money you save in your 40s or 50s. I.e., a mere $100/month when you are 22 may be worth nearly as much as $1000/month later in life. $100/month may seem hard when you are young and poor, but it will help you not be old and poor, which sucks worse.",0.08929123323673378,0.0005912244980430954,0.037186435267994096,0.00029096131543673897,0.019769228700506843,0.003761084271754965

dvzvysa,"> you're not as far from Facebook as you may initially thinkThe difference is that 99% of the data you can gather about a user on reddit is totally public data. If i post a comment or upvote/downvote a post, that information is visible to every single person who has a computer, internet, and can read the website. While I may or may not like what you do with that information, **I'm** the one who let you have it by posting it publicly with my username attached to it.Now on reddit, my email, IPs, and private messages are NOT posted publicly, and I would have room to complain about that data being used. How much I should validly complain is subjective, but it's greater than 0. On facebook, I have no ground to complain about my friends or firends of friends learning my opinions and general location due to my posts, but I didn't post it to anyone outside of that group (even if that is a fairly large group). The data on my facebook that is meant to not be fully public is much more extensive than what reddit possesses. I don't truly expect them to keep it all private (internet etiquette), but I will demand that they do *everything* rationally possible to keep it to themselves.**TL;DR** Anything we post publicly online with our username attached is fair game. 99% of reddit's data falls into this category, so the 'blame' is on you for oversharing.

dvzd8m3,">let you own your own data... outrage is a strong motivatorYou're totally right, and I think it's going to have to be both outrage and a viable alternative.In order to let you own your own data, this hypothetical platform would have to find a different way to make money. Even if it tried to stick with ad revenue, but do so in a more consumer friendly way, they'd probably be screwed - the advertisers themselves benefit from facebook's model, and facebook already has the unbelievably huge user base.Finding money isn't the only problem. The size of facebook's base is a problem in other ways - most obviously, that people will hesitate to leave. In order to be convinced to leave, the new platform will have to be a magical mix of familiar and novel - too similar to facebook, and there's no reason to leave (plus potential copyright/other IP problems.) But if you make it too *different,* there won't be enough of the stuff that people want, and/or they will be intimidated by the differences. Oh, and it can't just be different, it has to be *better.* Then, it's going to have to promote the shit out of itself. It will have to grow at good rate for a decent amount of time, otherwise facebook will just smother it and wait it out. This platform doesn't only have to compete with facebook, but it will also have to *fight* facebook. Facebook might see this as a threat, snap their fingers, and be *super nice* about privacy and data security... for a while, anyway. Or, they might just drop a couple billion dollars on a marketing campaign, nbd. Or they might release some new feature or doodad they've got tucked away. Or harvest the power of their existing infrastructure and mind power to develop and implement that new doodad before the new company even knows what hit them. Something that new platform has going for it is good will and a positive clean track record. Facebook - like countless companies before it - is its own worst enemy. Greed, random mismanagement, and scandal have brought all sorts of companies to their knees.
