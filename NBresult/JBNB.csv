School dances were pretty expensive and would easily cost a few hundred dollars once you factor in the cost of the DJ and rent-a-cops and stuff. We'd often make money off the dances (so they were like their own fundraiser), but still, that initial money has to come from somewhere. And then that money would go on to funding the other events that we had throughout the year. So, things like Halloween days or Christmas events or whatever. These things cost money, and it's something the kids want (at least so they can get out of class for the day) but it's not something the school itself is willing to pay for.Prom/Graduation was a big thing too. Those things are pretty expensive. I went to a super small high school, and that thing was still probably a couple thousand dollars to run....We occasionally fundraised for a specific cause as well. Like raising money so certain kids would shave their heads, and then giving the money to some cancer charity. Or at one point, we bought a goat for an African village or some shit. I personally thought that one was pretty dumb, but these two girls were super into it and wouldn't stop going on and on about it so that happened. That was like $400 too, it was ridiculous...Most of the more expensive classes ran their own fundraisers as well. Things like shop, music, even gym class, all to try to get new equipment.... Or I know our English/History classes would raise money to send kids to museums or plays and things like that.At the end of the day, you don't *have* to donate money, but schools can't really afford to pay for a lot of the fun things kids want to do, so fundraisers seem fine to me.... unless you're raising money for a goat, then that's just stupid.

In the state I grew up in (WA) You need to have a BA and gone through a teacher's training program. Not necessarily last resort, but can easily become one for a struggling college graduate as your BA does not need to be specific to teaching. At least for public schools.-lack of funding/ broken system; teachers lower their standards so students get A's and therefore get from the system more federal funding to compensate for their lack of funding, to play the system that was trying to heighten standards. This lowering of standards allows crappy teachers to remain teachers.-teachers union; also allows shitty teachers to remain teachers. A lot of the time, once past their probation period (which is like 1-4 years in most cases) teachers can sit on their ass or be the most toxic people in the world and not get fired as long as they ascend to mediocrity during teacher observations (which aspire to be like random inspections but the execution and result is laughable)-over-prioritization of sports; some teachers are just there to be a coach rather than to actually cause students to learn (some exceptions of course, I've had good teachers that also coached). And I'd say a significant portion of the time these 'teachers' get promoted to principal. -bureaucracy.Source: went through school with a healthy amount of cynicism and observation.Of course this just paints the negative aspects. On the flip side, a significant portion of teachers teach because they wanted to teach in the first place and are good at it.
