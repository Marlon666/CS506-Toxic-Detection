doa3i8h,"Personally, I am reluctantly in favor of abortion. I am 100% in favor of abortions in the case of rape or incest. I'm also in favor of voluntary abortions for any reason if they occur very early in the pregnancy. I don't think life (or personhood) begins with a fertilized egg, but I also can't really pinpoint when it does begin. I think we need a much better system of contraceptives and comprehensive sex ed (specifically acknowledging that people will make different choices when they are horny versus when they aren't. Dan Ariely has an amazing point about this in *Predictably Irrational*). Unfortunately, unless a woman who is raped happens to already be on some form of contraceptive, there's still a possibility that she could get pregnant. I don't support but fully understand the pro-life argument. Gradual change is a complicated thing to fathom, so there is a definite logic to believing that life begins at conception. If life begins at conception, then anything done to terminate that life is murder. Pro-lifers are one of the few groups that don't upset me when they go around with their giant posters of aborted fetuses or picketting clinics. It's incredibly hard for the women that have to get abortions, but these people legitimately and genuinely believe those doctors are performing **actual murder** on a regular basis. The main issue I find is when pro-life people support abortions in the case of rape or incest. I understand it because it's a complicated scenario, but they are effectively saying you have the right to murder an innocent child if the father of that child raped you. It's relatively inconsistent with the notion that abortion is murder.",0.09327638630354732,0.0016216110789876862,0.015824167480703356,0.000606662949034749,0.010920097742527198,0.0011521478085877342

doh4w4q,"A direct abortion against a living human being? I'm against it. I don't believe directly taking the life of a living human being can be morally justified. I do believe the law needs to give room for the life and health of the mother because there are situations where saving both isn't possible. If the option to save both is present, it ought to be taken.In terms of the law, I think any law or policy that treats the killing of innocent life as a human right is a gross injustice and violates the most basic principles of human rights.With that said, I don't care for the fact that the Republicans have so much influence over the pro life community and fight an abortion simply at a level of reducing access while cutting off and limiting funds to programs that help pregnant women and new mothers or just the poor in general. Granted some of my concerns could be resolved if we had a single payer health care system rather than a system that requires pregnant women to jump through hoops to qualify for programs that they may not even be aware of. Moreover, while no one can deny that the pill played a huge role in the sexual revolution and sexual risk taking, I don't think abstinence education and trying to prevent kids from having access to contraceptives decreases the sexual risk taking or undoes the sexual revolution. I get that some pro lifers feel that the sexual revolution fuels abortion and thus must be undone to stop abortion, but I think that's a simplistic view of cultural changes. If there were a pro life Democrat who was sincerely pro life and promised to fund actual research into creative the most effective policies to reduce, prevent, and end the perceived need of abortion (promising regular reports over how effectively they're shrinking those numbers to show that their strategy is indeed working), then they'd be more likely to have my vote.

They're very pro abortion and I can't stand it.My frustration with both parties has led me to become a member of the American Solidarity Party, though I'm also a supporter of Democrats for Life.",0.06024353260260988,0.0014475769271721168,0.009076158241117464,0.0006077907284447511,0.006062983655152767,0.0008553541821724486
dpsec69,"People who call it the ""pro choice"" movement are purposely deflecting the argument. It's not about choice, everyone already agrees that anyone (regardless of gender) can do with their body as they wish. Same with calling it a fetus repeatedly, even when it's like in the third trimester. Taking to these people, they make sure to call it a fetus or an embryo or anything but a ""baby"", because then that would humanize the ""clump of cells"" and they can't have that.The argument is whether or not an unborn child has rights, when that person growing in your womb obtains those rights (when are they recognized as a human beings), and what those rights should be.Personally I think the only line you can draw is at conception. Scientifically speaking, once the egg fertilizes via a sperm, a zygote is formed. Zygotes contain distinct DNA compared to either of the parents, meaning it's DNA is NOT that of the mother's body's cells and thus it is not a part of her body. It is more than a clump of cells - technically all living things are a ""clump of cells"", yet pro choice people often cite this as a moral reason that the mother can do what she wants to it. People arguing to euthanize dogs don't call the animals a ""clump of cells"".It is in her body, yes, there's that. But that is inherently the nature of a developing fetus. Left to its natural devices (that is, existence), a fetus/baby will be born, become an infant, then a child, adult, etc. we all started out this way. Again, scientifically speaking, the zygote is undeniably human, with 46 chromosomes. That is by definition human. Why is a zygote more important than a skin cell, then, since they're both human? Skin cells (or any other somatic cells on a adult) don't turn into a developing human being. So zygotes are unique in this aspect.And where do you draw the line? Honestly? I want to know why other people think at what time it's okay to abort the developing fetus up to. The third week? The third trimester?Until the heart starts beating? There are adults with pacemakers. Until the brain stays functioning? What about autistic people or those in a coma? Until limbs start developing? There are disabled people born without limbs, or missing hair, or blind, or who can't breath without a ventilator. Should they be considered less than human?Personal argument time:I personally think the argument that you're not ready is (minus cases of rape) invalid. Did you have sex? Yes. Were you aware that sex is the one thing that creates other human beings? I should hope so. Poor planning on your part should not constitute an emergency (murder) on the baby's part, who had no say in being made in the first place. Either have the standards to know who you're fucking well enough to have a plan B (be it adoption or what have you) or wait until you ARE ready. Because the pill/condemns etc CAN fail. There's a low probability with protection, but the chance is there and it is real. That is why abstinence only education used to be prevalent - regardless of the religious context, it is the one 100% way for knowing you're not going to have an accidental pregnancy that you can't afford right now or that mommy will kill you over, etc. Pregnancy, and children, are a factor in sex. That's a fact. As fun as sex is, it can have consequences (or you can see it as a reward, for those trying to have children). You were ready the moment you consented. If you really don't want the baby when you find out, give it up for adoption. Nine months of being pregnant (which is not the horrifying blood and guts traumatic PTSD inducing experience pro choice people make it out to be, just ask your mother) is a fair trade for not murdering someone who never meant to cause you any ill will in the first place. You put that baby in your womb, not your friends, not your parents, not your peers. YOU did. I wish people would stop being so irresponsible and then to add insult to injury, put murder on top of that.
