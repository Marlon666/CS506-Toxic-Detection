dtfl108,My first nba game I went on the court as well. The 76ers could care less as long as you weren't center court or in the players way. At least it seemed that way. I played basketball all my life and ever since I was a kid all I wanted to do was touch a real nba ball. Call me weird but I have this thing where I want to associate things with touch. Like a turnbuckle from the wee. Always since I was kid I wanted to feel one. Anyway to my surprise the nba ball feels nothing like a ball you use in high school.
