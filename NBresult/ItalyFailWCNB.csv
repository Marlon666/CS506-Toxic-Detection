dpscxv5,"Fair point. The only thing you really had to play for was not getting too much injuries and yellows, but the not conceding 7 goals thing was basically a given. On the other hand, the only thing the Netherlands realistically had to play for was one final hurray. Arjen Robben already said before the game that we should be honest and say that it's not going to happen. But we (or they) had the obligation to try, to show to the public that they still have some fire in them. The final game for the Netherlands was actually more about restoring honour then about winning by 7 goals. That was never going to happen.But I do agree that we shouldn't count this final game. If we both had something to play for then it would be a very different game. I think it's not unfair to say that in the first game the Netherlands was the better party. But this was also the best game of the Netherlands in the qualifiers while it was the worst game by Sweden. The Netherlands got worse throughout the tournament while Sweden got better. That's what some old Swedish international said anyway in some news article. At this final stage of the tournament Sweden played better than the Netherlands did. It is not unreasonable to think that we would have lost if both parties had something to fight for.If we look throughout the entire qualifiers, Sweden clearly deserved the spot more than the Netherlands.

And there was also ""Lunfardo"", an Spanish dialect spoken mostly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the lower classes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Lunfardo is known mostly for Tango lyrics). Nowadays you have the Rioplatense Spanish, a dialect spoken in Buenos Aires and Uruguay, it's the famous dialect asociated with Argentines. It has intonation patterns similar to Italian and A LOT of slang derived from Italian. Of course, as a ""porteño"", I speak this dialect of Spanish and when I talk with Spanish speakers from other countries I have to ""neutralize"" my Spanish to be understood.Finally, lots of Argentineans learnt Italian (something like 1,5 M, 3,4% of the population) but not because they use it on a daily basis.

If Zlatan comes back he will get all creds for anything good that happens so this is a sacrifice the other players must make so therefore they should be a part of the decision process.
