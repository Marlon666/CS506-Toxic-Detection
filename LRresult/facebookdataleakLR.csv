"Elon Musk co-founded Zip2 in ‘95, (it was a web software company building the backend infrastructure to things like newspaper websites or something). That was sold to Compaq for $340 million in ‘99. Then he founded x.com, an online banking backbone that merged with continuity and became PayPal. That was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 Billion. At that point, according to an interview I saw, Musk asked himself what one crazy thing he would most want to do with his now enormous pile of money, before dying, and that was go to Mars. He started doing research and realized that rocket tech has practically been stalled since the 70's, and everyone just buys old rockets from Russia. He thought that was pathetic and he could do better, for less. I'm not even sure where I'm going with this... I just think it's kind of amazing. He did the traditional internet tech wiz shit with web infrastructure and software. He sold for a HUGE profit and then decided to take that pile of money and do the crazy amazing dream shit many geeks dream about but absolutely dismiss as impossible. Revolutionizing electric cars, renewable energy, and making space travel an actual real thing that can happen beyond governments and underfunded NASA.

Until then it's just kinda hoping he's thinking about this stuff.

"Just a little correction:>Then he founded x.com, an online banking backbone that merged with continuity and became PayPal. That was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5 Billion. X.com was not working out and was bought by continuity who then absorbed people working there, including Musk, which they put as project lead on early developement of PayPal. He was no longer working on PayPal by the time it was sold and Musk saw very little of those 1.5 billion.This is not to say that musk was poor. He had, if i remmeber correctly, something like 400 million net worth at that point. He did not use it to start Tesla though, instead he found investors to pour money into it.Zip2 was so far the only actually profitable company Musk has had. As far as space travel goes, most of SpaceX budget comes from US government, so its still government funded space travel, just with some money laundering possibilities because NASA was just too useful to fund.

"There's plenty of reasons for an executive, especially of a publicly traded company, to sell stock. A lot of times, most of the compensation of an executive is stock. It's not like they just go ""here's a million shares"" once you get hired and thats it. It will be something like ""your compensation package is one million dollars in salary and 12,000 shares per quarter"". This is supposed to incentivise the exec to create growth because that means that their compensation is worth more. But it's worthless if they can't touch it. So what happens is that an exec will set up a plan to sell X number of shares per quarter/year/whatever that they can then actually take home as money. This will be pre-cleared with the SEC.

"Can't argue that. But I wouldn't say that they useless, but they aren't as powerful as they used to be.In my job, the only use they have is helping you from getting fired for little to no reason. Unfortunately that's the extent of it.An example of how they attempt to be useful, but get over powered is one time my management wanted to enforce an additional duty that was beyond our scope of practice and wasn't apart of our functional statements. Of course everyone went to the union about it and sent out a cease and desist order to my management. My management laughed at it (in front of the employees) and said that if anyone refuses, it's a direct order from management. When we told the union of their reactions, they said that we had to comply with direct orders or it could cost us our job or affect our yearly performance down the road... Even though it wasnt apart of our duties and the union sent out a cease and desist. The director of my employment also agreed with management and we were forced to due this duty in the end.

"Back 10 years ago or so, I noticed that the value of Dell Computer was varying a bit. Using Michael Dell's number of shares, I figured out that his net worth was jumping up and down by millions every few minutes, hundreds of millions in an hour or day.I pondered how that would affect one's perspective. It seemed to me that the concepts of net worth and the value of one's time just completely falls apart in that situation. For example, one could take a dump and lose - or gain - $5,000,000 before you wipe. The numbers just don't make any sense any more.All you can do is abstract yourself from the equation, and just see what you can do to improve the value of the company, and leave it better off than you found it. And, from talking to real 'old money' people, in fact that turns out to be the key. If the fifth generation (yes, that long) accepts the fact that they don't own the money/assets, the money/assets own you, and you are just the custodian for a decade or two, then your family are on the way to 'old money'. It's no longer about the toys and parties, it's about taking care of something that has lived for a century, and will (if not screwed up) live for another century or 10, producing goods or making life better for everyone.Cases in point: as of a couple of decades ago, the Twining family still owned Twining teas, after over 250 years.

"Another way to think of it: Let's say you have $1 million. If you spend $1,000 a day, you run out of money in 3 years. But if you have $1 billion, you run out of money in 3,000 years. Or, spend $100,000 a day, and run out of money in 30 years, but you will have a lot of stuff.If you are a billionaire, most things are so cheap you could simply act like they are free.

I hate articles like this that say he's lost 5 Billion.

"I really agree with this. Capitalism isn't inherently the problem here. When capitalism isn't a black hole of greed and when it borrows a good amount of ideas from socialism, it's a really fantastic system. A small company that is running pretty well and is treating its customers and workers well isn't something to get angry at. The problem with capitalism is when gigantic companies dominate markets, overprice their products, treat their workers like shit, use their customers to get rich on things like data or addictions, or lobby the government to change laws to their benefit. In an ideal capitalist society, there would be a vast amount of small companies all in competitive markets. There would be laws keeping the private sector from influencing the government, laws protecting workers and customers, and laws preventing companies from growing too large. If those three things were fulfilled, I'm convinced that capitalism would look much more ideal than it looks today.

In particular, the workplace of nineteenth century Europe was (to the best of my knowledge) much less fragmented than it is today, and far fewer people were self-employed. So, of course, there will be fringe cases or counterintuitive cases. The argument of whether it is a useful category is for another time.Which sounds pretty far away from ""the left hates small businesses.""And the thing is, I say all this *as a small business owner.* (Admittedly however, I don't employ anyone.)

"I think this view is misguided for a few reasons:1. The value an employee generates when part of a company can be greater than the value of that same effort solo. If you're really good at riveting, you can probably generate more value combining forces with other talents to build airplanes than you can with random freelance riveting work, even if you expend the same effort in each job.2. Organizing a production effort is itself a big job, and companies need to make profits to pay for overhead. This overhead is essential to production, not dependent on financial system.3. Furthermore, deciding where to invest production effort is also a big job. I'm guessing this is where you feel capitalism is exploitative, because the mechanism we use to pay people for this job is giving them a return on good investments. This looks like getting paid for nothing except ""being good at capitalism"", but again the job of choosing how to invest production effort exists independent of financial system, and this is capitalism's method for rewarding that job.So of course I agree that capitalism can be exploitative, as can any system when abused. I don't think, eg, American capitalism is a eutopia, and obviously many people are being compensated disproportionately to their job. However, there are also many good companies that run things right, and switching financial systems doesn't solve the problem of bad actors trying to exploit the system.Edit: To summarize, you're saying capitalism is inherently exploitative.

"Good points.I'll just add, that having your money - or your company - in a low tax situation makes a huge difference on growth. High taxes are a huge drag on growth.For instance, let's say you start out with $1000. if you have $100 in profit, and that is taxed at 35%, you actually have $65 to invest in growth. If you are taxed at 5%, you have $95 to invest. Assume you continue in a linear fashion, after 10 years you will have $1,877 or $2478 respectively. If it's in a tax-free account, even better - $2594. And if you are taxed at 60%, after 10 years you'll only have $1480.This also reminds me - if you are putting your money in good places, money saved in your 20s can be worth 8 to 10 times as much as money you save in your 40s or 50s. I.e., a mere $100/month when you are 22 may be worth nearly as much as $1000/month later in life. $100/month may seem hard when you are young and poor, but it will help you not be old and poor, which sucks worse.",gar37bic,0.10932478689091382,0.00741105924662103,0.04920752113827953,0.003673776104304744,0.053245936962708254,0.009463423585048465

"> you're not as far from Facebook as you may initially thinkThe difference is that 99% of the data you can gather about a user on reddit is totally public data. If i post a comment or upvote/downvote a post, that information is visible to every single person who has a computer, internet, and can read the website. While I may or may not like what you do with that information, **I'm** the one who let you have it by posting it publicly with my username attached to it.Now on reddit, my email, IPs, and private messages are NOT posted publicly, and I would have room to complain about that data being used. How much I should validly complain is subjective, but it's greater than 0. On facebook, I have no ground to complain about my friends or firends of friends learning my opinions and general location due to my posts, but I didn't post it to anyone outside of that group (even if that is a fairly large group). The data on my facebook that is meant to not be fully public is much more extensive than what reddit possesses. I don't truly expect them to keep it all private (internet etiquette), but I will demand that they do *everything* rationally possible to keep it to themselves.**TL;DR** Anything we post publicly online with our username attached is fair game. 99% of reddit's data falls into this category, so the 'blame' is on you for oversharing. Remember internet etiquette? Either don't share it publicly, or don't be self-righteous when someone puts 32 and 371.4789 together.Edit: Put TL;DR in the right spot.",Alderis,0.041959188646399775,0.00379954835938101,0.02108352115942803,0.00270304749289798,0.0177119636885015,0.005258244238509472

">let you own your own data... outrage is a strong motivatorYou're totally right, and I think it's going to have to be both outrage and a viable alternative.In order to let you own your own data, this hypothetical platform would have to find a different way to make money. Even if it tried to stick with ad revenue, but do so in a more consumer friendly way, they'd probably be screwed - the advertisers themselves benefit from facebook's model, and facebook already has the unbelievably huge user base.Finding money isn't the only problem. The size of facebook's base is a problem in other ways - most obviously, that people will hesitate to leave. In order to be convinced to leave, the new platform will have to be a magical mix of familiar and novel - too similar to facebook, and there's no reason to leave (plus potential copyright/other IP problems.) But if you make it too *different,* there won't be enough of the stuff that people want, and/or they will be intimidated by the differences. Oh, and it can't just be different, it has to be *better.* Then, it's going to have to promote the shit out of itself. It will have to grow at good rate for a decent amount of time, otherwise facebook will just smother it and wait it out. This platform doesn't only have to compete with facebook, but it will also have to *fight* facebook. Facebook might see this as a threat, snap their fingers, and be *super nice* about privacy and data security... for a while, anyway. Or, they might just drop a couple billion dollars on a marketing campaign, nbd. Or they might release some new feature or doodad they've got tucked away. Or harvest the power of their existing infrastructure and mind power to develop and implement that new doodad before the new company even knows what hit them. Something that new platform has going for it is good will and a positive clean track record. Facebook - like countless companies before it - is its own worst enemy. Greed, random mismanagement, and scandal have brought all sorts of companies to their knees. Maybe we'll get lucky, and it won't take decades for *this* behemoth to finally roll over and die, the way it's taken others.",mainfingertopwise,0.07680488956971428,0.004706519972478089,0.03609663116108719,0.0033430964395373976,0.027394124191732074,0.006292389509450722

If your net worth is measured in the billions you probably don't actually care about money - not really.Past a certain point the only actual benefit to having more money is how much money you can say you have. You're higher up on some rich list. Practically a billion dollars is enough to do basically anything you want for the rest of your life (no matter how old you are when you get a billion). If you're 30 years old and have a billion dollars then you have something like $50k per DAY to spend for the rest of your life.

"**Third-party doctrine**The third-party doctrine is a United States legal theory that holds that people who voluntarily give information to third parties—such as banks, phone companies, internet service providers (ISPs), and e-mail servers—have ""no reasonable expectation of privacy."" A lack of privacy protection allows the United States government to obtain information from third parties without a legal warrant and without otherwise complying with the Fourth Amendment prohibition against search and seizure without probable cause and a judicial search warrant.
