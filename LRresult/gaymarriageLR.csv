"Well, that particular incident with the threat of being shot was in Bath. But I've experienced verbal abuse on the street for holding hands with my partner many times in many places, and innumerable 'mucky looks'. I'm not a confrontational person, so personally I would rather prefer not be threatened with violence or death when I'm trying to go about my life. How often do you see gay couples holding hands in the streets? The truth is very few actually dare to do it because they know they will be subjected to harassment. Straight people are often so naive about what LGBT people have to go through on a day-by-day basis. It's not even just when with my partner that I receive verbal abuse, and it's not just from young men who are trying to look big in front of their knuckledragging friends (though that does describe most of them). I get anxious when in the city centre on Friday and Saturday nights because I know that LGBT people have been attacked on the streets here before and I worry that I will be victimized. As I said, I'm not a confrontational person and I'm quite short and not muscular, which marks me out as a target. People looking for a fight can pick up on something as minor as a badge or wristband as happened in Leeds in 2010. [This article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11831556) describes some of the more violent gay-bashings that have taken place in recent years. Even aside from those physically violent events, if you'd listened to the parliamentary debate on gay marriage, you'd understand that 'not really caring' is absolutely not how many adults feel about LGBT people - we were being slandered and defamed by many of the MPs who are supposed to represent us as citizens on Tuesday. All this is in the UK, a fairly socially liberal country. In many places it is far worse. Please don't be naive and trivialize what LGBT people go through.

As it stands the Scottish Government has responsibility for those powers that weren't reserved by Westminster (primarily things like taxation and defence).So the legislature is currently semi-separate (there's a hierarchy in areas where they overlap), however the legal system itself has always been entirely distinct (e.g., an admission of guilt isn't sufficient evidence to convict in Scotland, it must always be corroborated by a second source).As such you can end up with a complicated series of overlapping laws - something might be legal in Scotland, unrecognised by the UK, recognised by the ECHR, etc (or the reverse: Scotland's smoking ban was introduced a year before England - so the same action was legal in one country but not in another).In terms of residency, that is an area that is currently reserved by Westminster - the foreign national would have a marriage that was legal in Scotland, was unrecognised in the rest of the UK (England+Wales+NI), and as such would not make a difference to UK residency.",mojojo42,0.019537271558276254,0.004112152686217571,0.013587701905017865,0.0024631595963803005,0.01260819673283547,0.005219409760401867
"> The problem here is that if a Church of Scotland minister, for example, refused to carry out a same-sex wedding they could be charged with discrimination under the current law. No one really wants to make religious figures refusal illegal, so the law needs changed. This could either be done for the whole of the UK, or by introducing specific legislation in Scotland.The UK bill contains an amendment to the Equality Act covering this. I'm not sure it is necessarily needed, though: the Act contains an exemption to allow religious groups to refuse goods and services on the basis of sexual orientation (and religion/belief).

"From a legal perspective his question has merit (though I suspect he was voting on 'moral', ie bigoted, grounds as opposed to legalistic) - due to current divorce/annulment law, gay sex (of any kind) doesn't count as adultery or consummation. Those are important as they're so-called 'grounds for divorce' that permit a divorce or an annulment. So technically there is something to be discussed there if 'gay divorce rights' are to be the same as everyone else's.But that's the point of amendments and of committee stages, and failing that, the judiciary. Let's get gay marriage sorted before we get worried about gay divorce! (And besides, most divorces are done on grounds of 'circumstances' these days, which can easily be legally used by a gay married couple who wish to divorce because one of them was unfaithful - one bizarre footnote to all this is that in a current straight marriage, it's never legally counted as adultery if a man has sex with another man.)",filioqueclause,0.06789966240366543,0.004886332399047817,0.022443310860940365,0.0027581025008163746,0.023221769135681983,0.01485685535125758

As I understand it, consummation specifically requires penis-in-vagina sex. However, many married couples in which at least one person has a disability or medical condition, is very elderly, or is intersex or transgender or asexual, will never perform this sex act. A minority of same-gender married couples (involving a trans or intersex person) will. To me, the obvious thing to do is to take consummation out of the law.

"> That's 175 people who don't believe in equal rights. IF you had watched the debate you'd know that that isn't why many of them voted against it.

They are concerned that they might get double-crossed again (that the CoE/religion exemptions might be removed in the future). - Some wanted marriage to remain between a man and a women but wanted to expand civil partnerships to straight couples (for equality, or something). - Some felt that there were more important issues, even in equality (e.g. women in the House of Lords) and that this issue was both unimportant and because it wasn't in a manifesto that it wasn't a democratic change. - Concerns were raised that essentially the law would only change the name of the thing, and needed a lot of work in order to cover historical legal problems (and maybe to automatically convert Civil Unions into Gay Marriages, since Civil Unions were now redundant). - et al My point is, that if you watched the debates you might disagree with the opposition to this reform (as I myself do) but you cannot just paint them all with the ""bigot who hates equality"" brush as so many are quick to do.

"What I find strange is that your position is considered to be gaining perfect equality. All people wanting a legally recognised opposite-sex partnership without wanting to commit to social expectations of marriage - focus on children, monogamy, &c. - have been denied the ""right"" to have a civil partnership.This inequality is not being corrected. Nor does it seem anyone is arguing for that correction which is such an obvious inequality within the framework being discussed that it's omission really stands out. Why is that?Couples of opposite sex who wished to have a civil partnership are still excluded from civil-partner pension benefits.Now that the Commons have decided that marriage is to be dissociated from family life and is no longer to be supported for any [perceived or actual] benefits towards societal support of parents there seems to be no logical reason to exclude any pairing from (or perhaps group) from marriage.""Marriage"" within families should now also be allowed as the incest argument (that procreation within families should be avoided) is no longer valid if marriage is no-longer to have any [or at least a central] element of supporting and affirming parents. IMO the government can't logically stop at this position unless the reason for the bill is to simply punish those who hold marriage in high regard and adhere to the traditional family unit as a basis for building a properly functioning society. Now assuming this to be ratified there appears no argument against any form of partnership coming under the governments legal definition of marriage. That would IMO have to include partnerships with no element of sexual relationship and for any reason limited only by the conscience of the parties involved. Multiple partners of any configuration should be recognised.Of course this won't happen because no one is pushing this on the basis of true equality: if that were the actual aim the very simple action would have been to say ""this government will no longer care if anyone is married"" and drop all government activity as it relates to marriage.",pbhj,0.028081984429584775,0.0035748288410462296,0.01328073075124446,0.002516943649369116,0.012868295713951252,0.005386415613125282

">hey were unhappy with the legal protections/wanted more consolation on it (some lawyers have expressed concern that even with the so-called ""quadruple lock"" the courts could challenge it).This is bullshit and here's why.They say that some faiths *might* by law be forced to marry people they don't want to if this bill passes. So instead they want the law to remain the same, a law that makes it *illegal* for faiths to marry gay couples even if they want to recognize that marriage as marriage.**The law is ALREADY defining marriages for faiths and is ALREADY suppressing the religious freedoms of those faiths at the behest of other faiths.**But that's ok is it? We are meant to just forget that and look away because they prefer their faiths homophobic unequal view of marriage because they might, just maybe, but probably not at all be forced to treat people equally? Because it's so very clear that gay couples would just *love* to get married in a church that doesn't want them their because they would be just *wonderful*. They are children whining about how unfair it will be that they might have done to them what they are already doing to others. It makes me sick. Fuck them. The goal of this bill is not to force anything on faiths but to remove the very real restrictions of the freedom of other faiths and to grant equality and to allow equal people to call an equal thing the same.

Thought my views might help some of the people here understand what kind of people think same sex marriage is a step backwards, not forwards.I am against same sex not because I'm a homophobe, I have and know great people who are in gay relationships, but because to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of years. Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absent.Two people who love each other is awesome, but its something else completely different, and should remain separate.

"Let's take this apart shall we?> to me marriage is the foundation of the family, father, mother and their children, this is how it has worked in most cultures for thousands of yearsCheck your Eurocentrism. Indigenous cultures even up to the present day haven't defined marriage in such a way. The nuclear family is not a concrete social structure that humans are bound by some 'human nature' to fall into, it is a socially constructed phenomenon, and can be changed. If you want to try and call it religiously motivated, the Bible doesn't actually define marriage this way, with notable examples of polygamy and basically a lack of rights for the woman in a marriage. This is not how we see marriage today, so marriage has changed; the 'foundation' of man + woman still a recent development, as before it was more 'man dominating woman'.>Married couples with kids are 80% more likely to stay together than none married families while we all know the damage divorce does to children, with 70%+ of people in jail come from broken families that grew up with either father or mother absentWhat does this have to do with same-sex marriage? You say that 'married couples with kids' are more likely to stay together than non-married couples. However, this seems to be an argument **in favour** of same-sex marriage, as you haven't given statistics for married couples without kids, or even non-married couples with children. Besides, while there's still obstacles, gay and lesbian couples can adopt or have their own biological children by other means, so your argument doesn't follow. Neither does your statistic about people in jail coming from broken families. If broken families cause jail sentences, then surely this supports same-sex marriage as children of these families will have two parents. Unless of course you were suggesting that a same-sex couple couldn't raise a child as well as a mixed-sex couple? Didn't you say you *weren't* a homophobe?>I thought Civil Partnership, that gave gay couples exactly the same rights than married couples (with the exception of division of wealth in case of divorce, in my eyes a bonus!) was a healthy balance and most of people were happy, but politicians, in an effort to divide usYou do not get to define what is equality or progress for the LGBT community. They are they minority, and an oppressed one at that, and so they decide what's right for them and what they want to campaign for. Did you not notice the campaign and demonstrations by groups like Stonewall, LGBT activist groups, for the right to marry? 'most people' were not happy within the LGBT community, and they should not have the views of the majority imposed upon them. Politicians are not trying to divide with this legislation, they are trying to do the exact opposite and include a disadvantaged and oppressed group into a system that has neglected them until now. >and taking attention away of more important issues, like cutting down HUGE gap, and growing, between the poor and the rich.A few hours of debate did not stop progress on this, because it can't be solved in two hours debate.

It still technically is given that 59% of people marked Christian on the 2011 census.

I initially found it strange, given there are pretty much the same rights and privileges afforded by civil partnerships and marriages, that anyone was bothered by the way things are. I thought people were just getting hung up on the semantics of ""marriage"".However, the way I see it now is that the main problem is that ""religious institutions are not legally permitted to perform civil partnerships""^[1] and that is ridiculous. If a religious same-sex couple wish to have their legal union blessed by a religious institution which is willing to do so, there should be no state law restricting their rights (the couple's or the institution's) to do so.I can't understand why 175 elected MPs failed to look at it this way. It is a massive restriction on freedom of religious expression.>Why not overhaul all 'partnership' legislation so's no-one can get 'married' on the state, only civil partnered then allow all the churches of all the different shades to offer the marriage.That sounds like a great idea to me.^[1] ^http://www.findlaw.co.uk/law/family/marriage_and_civil_partnerships/500385.html",Dmcv,0.028539709965749446,0.0036561762917107395,0.014183712172090848,0.0024638903284413074,0.013340106744730377,0.005132807711077438

"Oooooooh so it's not that they are homophobic, just the book they blindly follow is... only they don't really blindly follow that book do they? If one of them goes out an rapes a women will he end up having to pay 50 silver to the father and marry the girl? Or will he end up in jail? I'm also sure none of them would be caught dead eating shell fish for example, oh wait, that's a god damn lie it's just that they and their faith is perfectly comfortable with the whole shell fish thing now that we've moved on and their faith does things like allow divorce... any one remember how the faith of some of them and our official state religion came about by the way? Oh that's right, a king had an attack of conscious and just had to convert both him self and his state to a new doctrine he had spent his life savaging which also just so happened to offer him a way to divorce a wife he didn't like and undermine the power of Pope with in his state. In short, no, this is not an excuse, even if they where just blindly willing to follow doctrine that's still no excuse because they are enforcing an unfair homophobic ideal on a public that is *overwhelmingly* not of that faith. But it's not blind faith for the most part it's an excuse and one that they can no longer hide behind because people are no longer buying the bullshit in the same way they used to.There are a number of faiths pushing for this bill so they have the right to marry their members in the way that they see fit.

I get just at angry at any one who argues in public discourse about public issues and the nature of our society from what I feel as fundamentally hypercritical view points.

"I think you are missing the point that civil partnerships have always been a poor relation of marriage (as they were intended to be). Some couples with a civil partnership do not have the same pension rights as if they were in a marriage (such as [this guy](https://twitter.com/Mark_Collyer), who keeps going on about it - though as it stands, the bill will extend this discrimination to same-sex marriages). It can be harder to get civil partnerships recognised in other countries than same-sex marriages, as the provisions for civil partnerships (or whatever they are called) vary so much from one country to another, whereas marriage is pretty much universal.The fact there will be at least one institution that treats same- and opposite-sex couples the same is important to many people: it will mean that you no longer have to out yourself on forms that ask for your marital status, and will mean that trans people no longer have to get divorced before they can obtain a gender recognition certificate.Same-sex couples also have the problem that they are seen as inferior to opposite-sex couples by much of society, and the term ""civil partnership"" really does contribute to this.

"> It all seems much ado about nothing to me - I mean ""Civil Partnerships"" are already the de-facto gay marriage thing. This just seems to add some kind of religious nonsense to it?Most marriage ceremonies in the UK are not religious. This bill does allow religious same-sex marriage ceremonies, but also also allows civil ones. There are a number of legal differences between civil partnerships and marriages (though immigration is not one of them, so your paranoia about illegal immigration is misplaced), which generally put civil partners in a worse position than married couples. But the main difference is symbolic, and is important for two reasons:* calling them ""civil partnerships"" instead of ""marriages"" reinforces the idea that same-sex relationships are inferior to opposite-sex ones. I have heard people in civil partnerships talk about times when they introduced their partner to someone as their ""husband"" or ""wife"", only to be lectured that they aren't ""really"" married and shouldn't pretend that they are.* children are raised with the idea that they will be married one day, and that this will be an extremely important and joyous occasion. I was a teenager when civil partnership was introduced, and I remember watching the news reports and realising for the first time (hopefully wrongly) that there was no chance I would ever get married. It made me feel really fucking horrible about myself.Also, there is the problem that any legal restrictions based on gender cause huge problems for transgender, intersex and genderqueer people, who fail to fit into the traditional binary view of gender. Lots of trans people have been forced to get divorced because of the current laws.",roomyn,0.06395135046435463,0.005228737873399871,0.028778444000155598,0.0030340624944126104,0.023193440551323767,0.008530170902265481

"Well, I think you will find all the goatfuckers and all on 419eater.com will easily disagree.

What does this whole ""marriage"" thing give over a ""civil partnership""? Personally I think get rid of all religious based marriages endorsed by the state, and everyone gets a stab at making a Civil Partnership. I don't care if the people involved fuck or bugger each other. They are merely sharing a life together in harmony and trust in each other so much that they wish to share all finances, and take advantage of all insurances, etc with each other. Why should the fact they are a traditional man and wife, or a pair of homo's matter. Why not some good buddies in a batchelor pad? ... and the old spinster Maiden Aunts I aluded to before? I think it is extremely cruel in the old girls case that the surviving sister of the pair is taken to the cleaners on the death of her sistor for Capital Gains Tax, etc, while a couple of homos can just fuck each other up the arse and get tax advantages that she can't.The answer is any pair of people should be allowed to have a Civil Partnership which is allowed in law as a simple contract.

You make at least three mistaken assumptions.a. That any church will be 'forced' to marry same sex couples.They won't.Some churches won't marry divorced people. Do you think that people that have been divorced then marry again are not entitled to be legally married and have the same status as any other married couple? Is granting divorced people the right to marry again dictating to any religion?b. That all churches oppose same sex marriage. They don't. In fact the Religious Society of Friends aka Quakers have been at the forefront in advocating for same-sex marriage.c. That only marriages carried out in a religious setting are 'valid'.

"Hey guys, instead of downvoting, lets honestly answer - this is a question that's been asked by a lot of people, even non-religious folk, that has to be made absolutely clear instead of tutting loudly.Okay, to answer your question.**Imagine a country where you, a heterosexual man (or woman), cannot marry your loved one because the state religion deems it**That's it.You might think there's more to it, but that is it.Let me put this into context, a mere 50 years ago, I (as an ethnic minority) could not legally marry a white woman. A black man could not marry a white woman, regardless of their love for each other, regardless of religion etc. They faced persecution for merely being in a relationship. Now, the claim is that religion is under fire if this marriage law passes. 50 years ago it was ""moral decency"", and the same claims were made on religious principles as well. Hopefully 50 years on, we can actually sensibly answer it with ""yes, god that was a quite bad time for human rights wasn't it?""Now there's lots of hooh-hahing about whether or not this infringes on religious grounds or that it redefines the historical definition of marriage, and as someone who respects freedom of religion, the answer is yes. Yes, the bible does clearly state that marriage is this thing, its not between people of the same gender, but then you have to accept that the bible makes a lot of statements that we ""accept"" as clearly being wrong, e.g. most christians do eat pork. Most christians don't keep women as chattel slaves. Most christians don't trade their daughter for slavery. Most christians don't see human sacrifice of their children as being acceptable substitutes for the slaughter of bulls, and so on. If you don't accept these things selectively, you're gonna have to explain why you do accept the other thing selectively. As for the historical definition of marriage, it has changed so many times and is written and re-written in so many cultures that its really difficult to define if marriage is actually historically between a man and a woman.And finally, who said that everyone follows the bible? I don't. Some people here don't. Does that mean we can't marry? Does that mean they can't? It certainly means, by the bible's own rules that I cannot marry someone who's a Christian.", ,0.05016226557953627,0.003574945114805507,0.02272865448962144,0.0025489721099157593,0.017889905681495497,0.006423173879391885

The UK did not become great because of Sir Francis Drake, it became great because of a single storm. The Spanish would have put a stop to English Christian reform and it's growing protestantism, not to mention the huge increase in literacy from widespread reading of The Book. Was the storm a coincidence? If (protestant) Christianity has been on the decline.. then many make a fair guess by supposing UK's 'greatness' is on the wane.",givecake,0.043949910600913085,0.004034582665443906,0.01968623493939388,0.0025324515791790322,0.018433492121623173,0.009039728254816854
"confused, much? you define progress to meet the needs of your argument. also, it's not about any particular ""cool"" gay couple but about the principle of not discriminating legally against people on the basis of their sexual preference. as to what the hell you're trying to say with regard to drake and the storm, i really have to no idea....good night and good luck!",simon99ctg,0.1707112690148137,0.007262326477225909,0.0500019848125383,0.00358305791695536,0.04841327150579211,0.0161668357942284
"I didn't define it! That was my opening point.. I was pointing at people saying these laws are progress, but it's *their own definition* of the word, and that this view has come from a clever direction via popular media. Proof? Check popular views of the masses regarding homosexuality 100 years ago! It would be naive to think something uselessly sentimental here, as if people were somehow maturing into this higher level of thinking all by themselves.Sexual preference? I'm going to assume that you believe there is some kind of neutrality to sexual preference. That it's 'OK' to choose whichever sexuality you like. Am I wrong? But there are things wrong. Even if you were to blame discrimination, the [mental health](http://www.narth.com/docs/whitehead.html) statistics [are not kind](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2072932/).And what about physical health? Well the two are entwined as much as they are, but there's [plenty of health](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/1970/32/7032205) [problems too](http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/archive/ldn/1931/dec/3112404). It's ok, Simon. I understand your thinking, and most people's. Because I have 'felt' the same way too. It's romantic to think that the heart can sway whichever way it shall and it's natural to follow it, or perhaps that people are just 'born that way'. While that may not be completely wrong, it's far from right as well. You see, our brains change. Not only do they change as the rest of our body changes, they change when we even think things. I'm talking physical changes that can be noticed during brain scans. Supposing that someone were to find evidence that gay people's brains were different to normal people's brains? That would make sense, even london taxi drivers brain's are different to the majority of the people's brains in UK. Look it all up, cast aside ignorance and free yourself from media mentality. I first learnt about Drake during GCSE History. I suppose you could have been asleep or just failed the class. Regardless, it's an interesting story! People may believe what they like though, I don't expect everyone to come to the conclusion I have. And besides, it doesn't sound like you're interested.I'm sorry I didn't spam you with more science, should the need arise, I shall retrieve it for you!Edit: Unless you have a problem with the science, and would like to submit some evidence and hypotheses for peer review to the appropriate body, I'm not sure there's any other question now as relevant as this: If being gay is something that can be changed (as has happened before) then what should we do as potential supporters? Should we encourage people in these paths of greater danger and disease or do as we would regarding any other danger? Encourage warning and caution and highlight the healthier options.",givecake,0.034919781352589586,0.0029873216852841287,0.013239010777125434,0.0026459169866997474,0.012426253075986132,0.00694950218978188
