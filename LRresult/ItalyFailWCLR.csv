"Fair point. The only thing you really had to play for was not getting too much injuries and yellows, but the not conceding 7 goals thing was basically a given. On the other hand, the only thing the Netherlands realistically had to play for was one final hurray. Arjen Robben already said before the game that we should be honest and say that it's not going to happen. But we (or they) had the obligation to try, to show to the public that they still have some fire in them. The final game for the Netherlands was actually more about restoring honour then about winning by 7 goals. That was never going to happen.But I do agree that we shouldn't count this final game. If we both had something to play for then it would be a very different game. I think it's not unfair to say that in the first game the Netherlands was the better party. But this was also the best game of the Netherlands in the qualifiers while it was the worst game by Sweden. The Netherlands got worse throughout the tournament while Sweden got better. That's what some old Swedish international said anyway in some news article. At this final stage of the tournament Sweden played better than the Netherlands did. It is not unreasonable to think that we would have lost if both parties had something to fight for.If we look throughout the entire qualifiers, Sweden clearly deserved the spot more than the Netherlands.

"To give credit where credit's due, Sweden's run still was impressive. Especially with Zlatan gone, lots of people didn't think they could do it. The Netherlands may not be at top form at the moment, in my view they're still about an equal match to Sweden right now. (Which showed during the two head-to-head games). Getting even a play-off spot was far from a gaurantee.This was probably the thoughest group around facing both France and the Netherlands. Before the qualifiers started Sweden was probably underdog with respect to both teams (despite the Dutch performance last years), and then they faced Italy in the play-offs, a team that has not faced elimination in 60 years.The WC ticket is more than deserved.

And you got only 1 point against the Netherlands, so it's not like you really exploited the weak position of the Netherlands you had to get your points against countries that *were* in form. You don't survive this group and then beat Italy just because of luck.Same with many Dutch people complaining how unlucky we were in our run (denied 2-1 against Sweden away and also Sweden beating France). If you miss two major tournaments in a row it's not bad luck anymore. It's not one game that we blew, it's a total of 20 at this moment (Euro+WC), at that point it's not a fluke anymore.It was an impressive run from Sweden.

"That's because Italy didn't colonize us and the Italians that came here were mostly poor uneducated workers who didn't speak Standard Italian well and spoke mostly their regional dialects. Then lots of them were educated in Argentine schools in Spanish. That was the case of my grandparents.At the beginning most of them spoke a Italian-Spanish pidgin called ""Cocoliche"". And there was also ""Lunfardo"", an Spanish dialect spoken mostly in Buenos Aires and Montevideo in the lower classes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Lunfardo is known mostly for Tango lyrics). Nowadays you have the Rioplatense Spanish, a dialect spoken in Buenos Aires and Uruguay, it's the famous dialect asociated with Argentines. It has intonation patterns similar to Italian and A LOT of slang derived from Italian. Of course, as a ""porteño"", I speak this dialect of Spanish and when I talk with Spanish speakers from other countries I have to ""neutralize"" my Spanish to be understood.Finally, lots of Argentineans learnt Italian (something like 1,5 M, 3,4% of the population) but not because they use it on a daily basis. It's just because it's a beautiful language and I'm an Italian citizen too, so I felt I have to know Italian.",izcaranax,0.03289010066099357,0.004113489156168477,0.019606064945468602,0.002554022845237669,0.016610077816302884,0.006016615651966951

**IIHF World Ranking**The IIHF World Ranking is a ranking of the performance of the national ice hockey teams of member countries of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments. The current leader in rankings is Canada in men's play and the United States in women's play.***^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/sports/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot) ^| [^Donate](https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/donate) ^]^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28,WikiTextBot,0.03231012208128356,0.005423006079471219,0.019237407924048905,0.002794900070403363,0.016762617102595846,0.006420710685453019

"I'm sorry but that's wrong. Saying the NHL ""just"" wants fair compensation is wrong.The owners of NHL teams don't want their players to go to the Olympics.1) the two weeks it takes away from the NHL, force the schedules to be condensed. It also pushes the NHL playoffs deeper into the MLB season. They don't want to compete with the NBA and MLB more than they already have to.2) Sending players to the Olympics has the potential to injure them. Players on the Olympics tend to be the best players on NHL teams. So to lose them for any amount of time is horrible to an NHL team.3) The Olympics don't bring that many new viewers to the NHL. The difference is negligible. The NHL seems slower post-Olympics so it really slows down their ratings.You don't have to agree. But these are the reasons the owners don't want players to go. It's the same reason that when people blame Bettman for not sending players there. It's not his decision. The owners voted against it.

Reacting like what? one example from a notable game 16 years ago after getting kicked with a ball unnecessarily?

The rest of the worlds perception of the NFL is boring/time outs/commercials etc. You say you've played football but think diving is so simple to eradicate really?It's a free flowing contact game with no stoppages so you're going to always have clash on the ankles that are impact injuries that take a min or 2 to recover and it's stupid to try Americanise that and punish the skillful players by not providing protection in the regards and just getting big bruisers instead.

Bro I'm Irish the situation isn't comparable what's so ever in the slightest. The game was irrelevant to who Panama were playing and had the goal not be given it was a penalty which more than likely had of resulted in a goal and a card. They didn't even celebrate that goal because they knew a draw meant nothing to them.Like maybe you'd have a point in a game of significance for both teams but it didn't matter in the grand scheme and changed nothing from the fact all the US had to do was not lose and go through.Henry was blatant cheating and conning the ref against an underdog who matched them in every way and should really be winning on the and celebrating in the dying embers of a playoff game which clearly meant so much more to us. That is disgraceful and a shame.

Depends on how you look at it. UEFA gets thirteen slots in the WC which means there will always be world class teams not qualifying.

"Id say the major issue with the current troop is we lack competent forwards. Janne has built a strong troop defensively, strategically and mentally. So theoretically Zlatan would be awesome for this team as he fills the void of lackluster attack (aka replacing Toivonen). At the moment we have Berg who can shine when facing a weaker team but when facing star defense it becomes pretty clear that he lack quality. My suggestion to Janne is that he opens a vote for all the players if they want Zlatan back (given that he wants to) and base his decision off that. If Zlatan comes back he will get all creds for anything good that happens so this is a sacrifice the other players must make so therefore they should be a part of the decision process.

"I am with you on this one. I often reflect back on that tournament and the team (plus Guus Hiddink) we sent combined with fixtures and we were as good a chance as any of winning it. (Don't forget Greece in 2004)We kept Italy under wraps for 91 minutes and were bossing them towards the end due to the extra man advantage. Granted we didn't actually create many chances against them... but who does? ... against Italy.We had them down to 10 men and 30 minutes of extra time coming up. If we win that game we faced Ukraine next up, they navigated an easy group overcoming Saudi and Tunisia to finish behind Spain. They had just beaten Swiss on penalties and I fancied our chances against them. Then we have a semi-final against Germany. Tough match and a likely German win but in this game anything is possible.

"Ok, as much as I sympathise, let's be honest here. You had italy down to 10 man for a straight red call that it was as arguable as the penalty. Your guy fell like he was shot, but Materazzi actually hit Zambrotta's shin. Once you see that called as a red, you have to know that the ref is being strict on the day. Regardless even in Sunday league you don't tackle in the box at the 90th minute of a game unless a) you're absolutely sure you'll get clean contact on the ball b) you're doing it to stop a certain goal. The intervention on grosso was goofy and uncoordinated. He completely missed the ball and obstructed a guy in the box that had just run 30 meters full throttle in the last minute of an elimination game. No way in hell that any player worth its salt would stay up in that situation, and your players were smart enough that they would have absolutely done the same.

"isn't this because the national teams basically suck ass because the true pros don't want to risk injury for a weak paycheck?and in the case of a disastrous blowout, you really don't have much to gain from it... where when you actually destroy and do well the whole tourney you're some sort of footnote because your competition was weak due to the nature of the teams.Basically, it's a series of nationalist ""all-star"" games, where people who don't really play together all that often get together under the banner of ""their country"" and give it a whirl.It's like if you took the musicians from a few bands you like, all from the same country, and had them play a concert of folk songs from their country.

"well lets see>isn't this because the national teams basically suck ass because the true pros don't want to risk injury for a weak paycheck?this is world cup qualifier not some anoying friendly match that dont count for anything. if italy don't win this they will not be in world cup which what happened last night. and playing in world cup is the biggest honor as an athlete in football.>and in the case of a disastrous blowout, you really don't have much to gain from it... where when you actually destroy and do well the whole tourney you're some sort of footnote because your competition was weak due to the nature of the teams.italy never do well in world cup after winning their last world cup in 2006 so i dont think they will steam roll team after team and thisis football. everything can happen.>Basically, it's a series of nationalist ""all-star"" games, where people who don't really play together all that often get together under the banner of ""their country"" and give it a whirl.and unlike any other all star match, if they win this they will be crowned as the king of football. remember, world cup is the highest competition in football and winning it will meant a lot.>It's like if you took the musicians from a few bands you like, all from the same country, and had them play a concert of folk songs from their country.

I can't think of any world class player in his prime that doesn't want to play in the world cup.
