Darth Manning was a Dark Lord of the Colts, so powerful and so wise he could use Force to influence the football to create wins… He had such a knowledge of the offensive side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing. The meme side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing the superbowl, which eventually, of course, he did.

So I parked in front of some software company, grabbed one of the windows from the truck, strapped on my tool belt and l walked up to the secretary with the window and told her I was meeting “Scott in maintenance” (because every maintenance team has a “Scott”) to replace a window in one of the restrooms. She gave me directions to where the maintenance team hung out, let me into the main building, where I did a number on a random bathroom. Then I left, passed the secretary, pointed at the window and said “still must be half-asleep, I brought the wrong size window from the truck”. She laughed and said she'd see me in a second.

Years ago. Maybe 15 years ago. A guy did this during a Manchester United champions league game. Went on to the pitch and actually lined up with the squad. I remember watching the game with my mate and we're like trying to figure out who this player is. He looks too old to be some unknown youth player making his debut. A few minutes later the he's gone and the commentary team mentioned he was an imposter. Fucking brilliant.Edit: he was called Karl Power.,Chemical_Robot,0.16112463784587064,0.010362614911453965,0.08360512366891272,0.003698267502405021,0.058623500574524694,0.011157107732793747

My first nba game I went on the court as well. The 76ers could care less as long as you weren't center court or in the players way. At least it seemed that way. I played basketball all my life and ever since I was a kid all I wanted to do was touch a real nba ball. Call me weird but I have this thing where I want to associate things with touch. Like a turnbuckle from the wee. Always since I was kid I wanted to feel one. Anyway to my surprise the nba ball feels nothing like a ball you use in high school.
