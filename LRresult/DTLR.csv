"Thank you. Thank you very much, everyone. Sorry to keep you waiting. Complicated business, complicated. Thank you very much.I've just received a call from secretary Clinton. She congratulated us. It's about us. On our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign.I mean she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of division, have to get together, to all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.It is time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all of Americans, and this is so important to me. For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people, I'm reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country. As I've said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign but rather an incredible and great movement, made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their family.It is a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs, who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I've spent my entire life in business, looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world.That is now what I want to do for our country. Tremendous potential. I've gotten to know our country so well. Tremendous potential. It is going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We're going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it. We will also finally take care of our great veterans who have been so loyal, and I've gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey.The time I've spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors.Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It is going to happen. We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time we will get along with all other nations, willing to get along with us. We will be. We will have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great. Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.America will no longer settle for anything less than the best. We must reclaim our country's destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We're going to dream of things for our country, and beautiful things and successful things once again.I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America's interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone.All people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility, partnership, not conflict. And now I would like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight a very, very historic victory.First I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now. Great people. I've learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I are truly great parents. I also want to thank my sisters, Marianne and Elizabeth who are here with us tonight. Where are they? They're here someplace. They're very shy actually.And my brother Robert, my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?My brother Robert, and they should be on this stage but that's okay. They're great.And also my late brother Fred, great guy. Fantastic guy. Fantastic family. I was very lucky.Great brothers, sisters, great, unbelievable parents. To Melania and Don and Ivanka and Eric and Tiffany and Barron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it is tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all. Lara, unbelievable job. Unbelievable. Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much. What a great group.You've all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all of the people that we have. Look at all of these people.And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got tremendously talented people up here, and I want to tell you it's been very, very special.I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani. He's unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings, and Rudy never changes. Where is Rudy. Where is he?[Chanting ""Rudy""]Gov. Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable. Thank you, Chris. The first man, first senator, first major, major politician â€” let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he is as smart as you get, senator Jeff sessions. Where is Jeff? A great man. Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up? Is that Rudy?Up here. Really a friend to me, but I'll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats, Dr. Ben Carson. Where's been? Where is Ben? By the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his familiar bring Sarah, thank you very much. Gen. Mike Flynn. Where is Mike? And Gen. Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign and there are special people. We have 22 congressional medal of honor people. A very special person who, believe me, I read reports that I wasn't getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He's an unbelievable star. He is -- that's right, how did you possibly guess? Let me tell you about Reince. I've said Reince. I know it. I know it. Look at all of those people over there. I know it, Reince is a superstar. I said, they can't call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win it. Like secretariat. He would not have that bust at the track at Belmont.Reince is really a star and he is the hardest working guy and in a certain way I did this. Reince, come up here. Get over here, Reince.Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy. It's about time you did this right. My god. Nah, come here. Say something.[Reince Priebus: Ladies and gentlemen, the next president of the united States, Donald Trump! Thank you. It's been an honor. God bless. Thank God.]Amazing guy. Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we've done, so I also have to say, I've gotten to know some incredible people.The Secret Service people. They're tough and they're smart and they're sharp and I don't want to mess around with them, I can tell ya. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down in the seat, but they are fantastic people so I want to thank the Secret Service.And law enforcement in New York City, they're here tonight. These are spectacular people, sometimes under appreciated unfortunately, we we appreciate them. So it's been what they call an historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job and I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job. I look very much forward to being your president and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years or maybe even eight years you will say so many of you worked so hard for us, with you you will say that â€” you will say that that was something that you were â€” really were very proud to do and I can â€” thank you very much.And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning. We're going to get to work immediately for the American people and we're going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You will be so proud. Again, it's my honor.It's an amazing evening. It's been an amazing two-year period and I love this country. Thank you.Thank you very much.

"Berner here. We had a large number of disagreements (with both candidates), but the way I see it, Trump was in some ways the Bernie of the right - a populist, insurgent candidate against party incumbents. The difference is, he was able to win big league. Trump won tonight because he not only got people to vote for him, but made people actively excited for the future. He had a coherent platform and vision for the country that resonated with voters. On top of that, he was open and communicative, even off-the-cuff via his Twitter feed, and that contrasts sharply with Clinton's closely guarded persona. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even though I may have agreed with Clinton more on policy (though not enough to vote for her), Trump was the better candidate.

"Right man. Not just sexist. Racist.... My first Sanders rally / march was in Baltimore. The march was planned by some Sanders for Maryland group. Their brilliant idea was to march though the some poor neighborhoods and stop traffic. Not the worst idea in the world. However it somehow became a BLM march, because all people were yell at every black person they could find was ""Black Lives Matter"". I started thinking aren't we here for Sanders? Don't All lives matter? This is divisive... even if you agree lets stay focused. Get our canidate out there. Let them know there is more to Sanders.I started chanting All Lives Matter and to their shock most of the people in the neighborhoods started cheering the same. Even some of the cops that were escorting us. Out of now were this SJW gets in my face and started screaming about white privilege and how I don't get it and I'm racist. I was like bruh... let me explain who I am and where I'm from.Next thing I knew my inner Baltimore came out and I BTFO this guy.The chants started up a couple again a couple of minutes later and I just laughed. That was my first real introduction to the regressive left. Now Hillary supporters are actually on a whole other level racists. They are the ones that drew up the SJW sables in the first place. Because they divide up people by votes. They don't see people, they see numbers just like the corp fucks they are. After they started calling Sanders sexist. I was officially done. Whats really sad is many of these people won't learn from any of this. They still think they are right. Hell look how the media establishment is already making excuses for them. Making shit worse by saying its a divided country. Well you fucks are the ones dividing us. All I care about people is if they are good people. If you aren't I want nothing to do with you.

"I've been depressed for many years... hated my job, hated college, (took me eight years to get an engineering degree), hated the direction the country was going in (SJWs, identity politics, etc; I'd lost hope). This election required voters to think critically; we had two very distinct choices for the first time in 40 years... and we won. My hope has been restored, my confidence in the country somewhat, and my personal confidence as someone who predicted he'd win in 2015 has been majorly, to the derision of my own family, who are mostly republican, totally restored. I'm contemplating taking another sick day. Many things went well for me today; I took it off mostly because I'm sooo bored at work, and always tired (I use little vacation or sick time); and because it was Election Day. I wanted my happiness of not working karma to flow to trump. Not only did I fix a broken tool, I fixed a broken truck that sat idle in my yard for four months, and the COUNTRY WENT MAGA! I've always wanted to run my own business: today has me feeling the confidence to do so! I've been right now, more than I've been wrong. My family thought me crazy when I said Trump would win (way back in 2015 when he announced). Trump, however pitiful this sounds, has made me believe in myself again. I feel, under his presidency, my only hinderance to success is me. I can accept that. I cannot accept an oppressive government doctrine and be happy.",pornaddict69,0.040666082,0.00451948,0.021192352,0.003058661,0.018369494,0.005753784

If your victory turns into a condemnation of your fallen foes then you'll end up no better that the business as usual Washington insiders you so strongly dislike.

"Mark Cuban backtracking on leaving the country. I'm sure most, if not all, of the others will do the same from the list of cucks. It's hilarious how Trump is out there complimenting Clinton and talking of wanting to help those who supported him and didn't. He talks of working for everyone, not just Republicans, and his crowd cheered wildly. Meanwhile, Clinton's people are on Twitter saying they fear for their safety and people like Cher do nothing to show any shred of respect or willingness to accept the idea that the other side would help them.Remember who the bigots are. We are willing to accept the losing side as crucial to moving forward as a unit. They want to spit bile and call names and react angrily. Why are we the side of hate?

"I feel like commenting just to be a part of this thread. I think it's incredible that in 50 years from now people will be able to see the chatter of regular people at particular points in time; that's something never done before in human history. As a WWII 'enthusiast' I wish I could read what ordinary Germans & British people were saying in the 1940's and I guess this thread is a bit like that.I sat up to watch the election at around 4am GMT. I am in Ireland so it wasn't my election but American elections are like world elections. I had booked the next day off work so I could stay up so late. I fell asleep and awoke at 4 or 5am to see Trump winning and I honestly stared at the TV for about 5 minutes in shock.I wanted him to win. Not because I was overly enthusiastic about his policies, but because he seemed like the only hope of ever reforming the corrupt American political system. The world follows America and I think that if Trump had lost it would have been the end of alternative candidates - ""why vote for X? They'll never win"". I don't think he was the right man for the job but given the choice of him vs. the status quo, I would go for him. Sadly it doesn't seem to have caused the political earthquake I was hoping for.Maybe someone in the future will read this long after it has played out and think something entirely different. Who knows, but I am glad he won.So there's my place in this historic thread, written @ 01:13am on 05-Feb-17.",theNotoriousJEU,0.033294935,0.003600409,0.018670321,0.002723531,0.015121029,0.005862643

"This was my very first election that I was old enough to vote in. Truth be told, I originally was not going to vote, or if I did it would've been for Bernie. I too, like my friends, joked about Trump and how ludicrous his chances of being president were.When Bernie was no longer a candidate I was heartbroken, contemplating choosing for Gary Johnson as the election drew near, more afraid at the idea of President Trump or President Clinton.However as time passed, I felt different. I couldn't, and still cannot, explain it. However I felt like Trump truly does care for America and truly wants to make it good again.When the election day came, I casted my vote for Trump. When my friends were crying in anguish over Hillary losing, I stood on the sidelines, happier than ever.My friends absolutely hate the man, and even think I might be joking when I tell them I support our president, but it's barely been a week and Trump has already gone through and done so much in such a short time.

But he sacrificed all of his wealth, his fame, and his lifestyle for his country. Throughout the election, Mr. Trump and his supporters were belittled by the mainstream media and even Hillary Clinton, who referred to Trump supporters as part of a ""basket of deplorables."" Not that he isn't guilty of similar behavior directed at the other side, but Mr. Trump and his basket of deplorables has done the unthinkable. We have snatched the oval office from the hands of a candidate who has gone through what seems to be a 30-year-long spree of incompetency, scandal, and crime. From the establishment of the failed NAFTA deal and the intimidation/silencing of Mr. Clinton's sexual assault victims to the abandoning of four American heroes at Benghazi and the threatening of our national security by the use of a private server on which classified government information was distributed, we have single-handedly saved our great country from disaster.---Under the presidency of Donald J. Trump, our country will prosper economically. Our country will be much safer and more secure thanks to a strengthened military and police forces. Speaking of police, law enforcement officers everywhere will be treated with the respect that they deserve. Black Lives Matter will be held accountable for their acts of domestic terrorism. Criminals will be treated like criminals, not ""victims"" of ""government oppression"", and held accountable for the crimes they commit. Hillary Clinton will finally be brought to justice for her crimes. Law and order will be restored. Judicial restraint will be applied in the Supreme Court. We will gain the upper hand in the fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism. College students will be treated like adults as opposed to being treated like children, meaning that the end of the age of ""Safe Spaces"" and being offended by anything and everything that goes against certain viewpoints is upon us. Under Donald Trump, this country WILL BE GREAT AGAIN.---God Bless you, God bless your family, and God Bless the United States of America.", ,0.040817296,0.004011553,0.017997918,0.003100687,0.018096801,0.006664742

Oh I know you all thought the fight was over after they called Trump the winner, but it's just started.

I finally opened up as a Trump supporter on social media and the backlash was insane.. I'm still a bit taken aback by how people I knew well have treated me for having a different (and obviously the popular) opinion... but it feels great to get it off my shoulder and know who stands with me and who are fools that aren't my friends at all.

"Wikileaks dump of dnc2 e mails shook them on the last day plus O'Keefe announcing he had a nation wide sting operation to bust doc cheating. He said operatives were everywhere and cheaters would be out and sent to prison. He'd already taken out the top players of dirty tricks and proven he was at lower levels when he exposed union bosses, smug donors at a fund raiser. All of this on the day before the election. Imagine their panic. Who would risk the humiliation and prison time to steal a few votes? Especially when the top guys aren't there to terrorize you into taking one for the team. Trump was very clever to set this up last year to neutralize the doc fraud machine at the very last minute. Plus he'd already made certain people were being hyper vigilant for fear Hillary would steal the election. Finally he'd made it Crystal clear that he would contest the election if he didn't win and there was even the hint of cheating.

When she returned I asked her what if she thought they were able to rehab. Her whole demeanor had changed wrt them and she said, yes, I think so. Sounds to me like cali is trying to normalize sex crimes. Keep it up Cali and we may need to wall your state off along with Mexico. Don't worry, we'll put in a big beautiful door that you can use if you do it legally and embrace our culture. Pedophiles are NOT normal and cannot be rehabbed. They belong in prison.

They do not read Wikileaks or read up on anything, they just believe what others are telling them: others who thought they were backing a winning horse, which makes it easy for them to not have to do any real digging for info. They believed everything the MSM said to them, and told me to shut up. Well, folks, you get what you pay for. I paid a year and half's worth of attention to this shit. They paid... lip service. They got the candidate they didn't want, oh well. Too bad. Not my problem. I tried to open your eyes. Oh and get this: my best friend just said she didn't see how we could go forward as friends. Because I am glad Hillary lost. That shit is boggling my mind. She (we were lovers at one time) said she is curled up like a baby in fear of her life. I'm astounded by that.

"For a long time I was convinced he would win because I strongly believed that there was a large group of people that didn't want to admit they were voting for him (because of fear of being accused of racism or something else awful like that)But in the last couple of weeks, especially after ""pussygate"" and combined with the fact that the debates were not the earth shattering blow outs I thought they would be....at that point the combination of the polls mixed with my conviction that she could rig it as much as she wanted to and still get away with it made me lose a lot of hope.People said ""she can only rig it X percent"" but after different stories came out in wikileaks and the media DIDNT GIVE A SHIT...I realized this woman could probably do whatever she wants and as long as the media is on her side everyone will just think it's ""right wing conspiracy""So because of those reasons, I was bracing for a loss today.I tried to stay optimistic. The_donald actually helped with that a lot, and I knew I was certainly going to vote and continue to spread the good word no matter whatBut whenever I told someone I thought we had a good chance there was this empty feeling like ""We do have a chance.......right?""And everyone would always just smile politely and say ""um, sure yeah I think we have a chance (anything can happen)"" but it felt like they were humoring me.My poor mom (not a tendie joke, I actually visit my elderly mother a lot) seemed to actually be worried about me because she knew how much it meant to meAnd even said a few times ""look no matter what happens, we'll be okay. It's in God's hands.""So yeah going into Tuesday, I psyched myself up a pretty good bit, but if you go through my post history to Monday and Sunday; you'll probably notice a lot of ""we can't let this movement die, no matter what happens"" kind of posts because I was bracing for a lossBut the irony is my original prediction was right all along (I just lost faith in it due to bullshit polls) and that prediction was that there were a lot of ""secret"" trump fans and also people who had never voted or hadnt voted in a long time that were simply not taken into account because polling usually just looks at people who voted in the last election aka ""likely voters""When it looked like we might lose florida (right at the beginning of the night) I was so pissed and thought ""wow we didn't even put up a fight""But I literally got on my hands and knees and a taste praying harder than I've prayed in my life and suddenly they start calling state after state for TrumpI consider it a modern day miracle",natman2939,0.077789055,0.004079204,0.036759358,0.003220942,0.020841967,0.006134638

"I'm in tears. And I'm not embarrassed to say it. I poured my heart and soul into helping get this man elected. I knew with every fiber of my being that this was the last chance we as Americans had at reclaiming our country from the corporations, the big banks, the globalists, the leftist ideologues. I always knew in the back of my mind, no matter how much I appeared optimistic on the outside, that this would always be an uphill battle. A classic david vs goliath battle. I convinced everyone I knew that Hillary wasn't the person they thought she was. I supported Trump openly and proudly. I just can't believe we've done it. It's unbelievably surreal. We helped put this man in the white house, and have reshaped the future of our nation, forever. The long hours fighting back against the rigged media, the NeverTrump clowns who doubted our movement every step of the way, and now they all have to eat crow. Congratulations President-Elect Donald J. Trump. We love you. And we're not tired of winning. We need to unite the country, and we will do exactly that but it will take time. Don't gloat too proudly though Trump supporters. We all know there's going to be backlash from the left, and organizations like Black Lives Matter, over the election of Trump. Rise above the fray. For the good of the country.And you know what I'm most excited for? The appointment of Trey Gowdy(Or Guiliani) to Attorney General, and the re-opening of the Clinton email investigation led by a special prosecutor. Even if she doesn't go to jail...

The world was at a crossroads on November 8th, 2016, and it could have gone so very differently than what it did.I was watching the results at work - some people at work knew I was a Trump supporter - and they kept telling ""did you know he's winning?"" and ""how the hell did you predict he was going to win despite everyone saying otherwise?""This day will go down in history for a lot of people in the 'States, and a lot of people worldwide. In fact, 20 years from now, people will probably be asking 'what were you doing the day that Trump was elected President?' and a lot of people will remember.In fact, even 4 months later, people are still screeching about the result, and sadly, probably will be for months to come.Just my thoughts, from a random centipede, on 12th March 2017, 9:33am.

"Interesting how Norway currently has a Conservative Prime Minister. I'm assuming she is very moderate and on the center-right.The sad thing is how the media misconstrues everything Trump says or does to make it seem negative. In the USA there are lots of alternative outlets at least - Breitbart, InfoWars, Drudge, ZeroHedge, etc., who can counter the mainstream media. That's why the mainstream media has gotten more and more shrill as they lose their grip on the American people.But overseas (and correct me if I'm wrong), the government has a much tighter hold on free speech and the internet. Europeans have no choice but to swallow the mainstream media lies.We are starting to find out that what was dismissed as conspiracies of global shadow governments for years, is actually true. The people are waking up, in the USA and somewhat in Canada.Anyways, the Trump Train is always growing and speeding up every day. If you want to join, we are always open, and if you choose not to that's fine as well. The redpill process takes time.", ,0.051250528,0.004396462,0.025114557,0.002844426,0.023291077,0.006771939
"I'm very undecided when it comes to American politics. I think we should give Trump a chance, but that doesn't directly mean I support him. And though I disagree with some of his choices and ideas, I agree with others. The thing about Anti-Trump Norwegians (From my experience) is that they have no fucking clue what they are talking about. They straight up hate Trump, and when you ask them why, they usually answer something like ""Because he's an asshole"". It's kind of a trend to hate Trump here, so people actually don't care about the politics and just hate because others do.",DJStatic,0.302600789,0.010463079,0.1374167,0.003627257,0.085682049,0.011089377

We sent a powerful message to corrupt politicians and struck a blow for the first amendment. I hope the next batch of politicians think twice before taking bribes and colluding with the media. I've never been so proud of my fellow Americans. And let's not forget the sacrifices of a true hero. Thank you Assange for fighting for transparency as one of the last true journalists. Being trapped in an Ecuadorian embassy is no small sacrifice in the name of keeping the common people as informed as possible. Free access to and flow of information is an outright requirement for a healthy democracy. Now let's Make America Great Again!

"currently, ""global warming"" is a democrat tax plan looking for a problem. no one disagrees that pollution is bad, but it's about regulation and pocket-picking with the dems.Trump is your best chance, of anyone running, for PRACTICAL solutions to problems such as this - changes that address root causes, not just democrat hard-ons for my paycheck.",calvinball14,0.067000844,0.006583104,0.032977944,0.003020455,0.028653207,0.007053958
"The place you're looking for is probably /r/AskThe_Donald, but I'll give you my answer. I'm actually majoring in environmental science and I plan to make a career out of it, and I'm a Trump voter. I have several reasons. First, Hillary would say anything to get elected and do nothing, she has lied so much that nothing she says can be taken as the truth. Her alliances lie with the special interests who funded her campaign and made her rich, including Saudi Arabia who is one of the biggest producers of oil in the world, and if you believe the conspiracy theories (which are just barely connected enough to make sense), they wanted an oil pipeline into Europe and the war in Syria is a proxy war to help make that happen, Russia is against it as they are the worlds second largest producer of natural gas behind us and would benefit from selling to Europe, she has been behind the keystone pipeline vigorously despite how her public stance on the matter changed, she has backed the TPP vigorously despite how her public opinion changed and countries that would benefit from the deal mostly produce goods by factories which are terrible for the environment, she would probably be bought out by the fracking industry anyways, so that wouldn't change, not to mention potential nuclear winter by blaming Russia for all her treason and hiding her corruption. Now that that's covered, onto Trump and what I believe he will do. Honestly I believe that we have bigger problems to deal with because we won't be able to do anything about the climate if we don't have a functional country anymore (although that's getting into other stuff), someone will always be there to dig up that coal, drill for that oil, extract that natural gas. In the end, my answer is that the earth will always be here, and I believe the best way people will learn and accept climate change is to learn from past mistakes, or else other people will just call into question your hypothetical scenarios.",ElegantBiscuit,0.042533727,0.003709194,0.021540223,0.00279225,0.017808522,0.006026431

"I agree with most of your prediction. I think there will be some sort of stipulation for people with preexisting conditions, and I certainly don't want to see anyone go without healthcare who needs it.The beautiful thing about an open market system versus a single-payer system is this, which I think you'll like. The companies have to compete. That means no massive run-ups in price, which a single payer system encourages. You could see the beginnings of this with Obamacare - the insurance companies were raising their prices because they had no reason not to with the massive stipends and such. They were going to get paid no matter what because the government was going to give out as much money as people needed to be able to pay those prices.With a free market system, with competition across borders between ALL the companies, they will have to price their plans accordingly. This means that the people will get better prices, *and* the government will not be giving away huge amounts of money to make it affordable. Think of all the money that *won't* be flooding into the insurance companies - if there's one thing I think we can all agree on, it's that corporate executives make too much money!",RedSocks157,0.05019592,0.004574796,0.024521816,0.003125486,0.020022403,0.006368526
"Thank you for the detailed and friendly response. I hope that this can be the discourse over the next four years and a sign that we can work together :)How does free market competition affect increases in the prices of drugs such as the EpiPen? Only one company makes that product, so what is keeping that company from juicing the prices? Before you tell me that it will drive innovation for better products, please keep in mind that drugs tend to have long patents that prevent that.Thanks again for the detailed response.",BlackJack1931,0.025424836,0.005116245,0.017057488,0.003132098,0.015466725,0.005566758
"I hope so to! I really want to see us make progress and I hope that everyone is as open-minded about what comes next.With insurance prices going down, the insurance companies will not be willing to pay as high of a price for the drugs because they aren't bringing in as much money from their customers. If the drug company wants to be able to sell their drugs, they have to price them at a point that the insurance companies will be willing to pay for people's prescriptions.I'm working on my MBA right now, a lot of this stuff is pretty simplified economics. There is a lot that goes into what happens in a market, but this is the general drift of things if the market is allowed to operate freely. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes the market a little while to adjust to new circumstances - it might even be a few years before we really see the impact of this kind of policy ripple out. But the end result is ultimately inevitable; the market will settle on an equilibrium point where the prices are as low as they can be while still generating a profit. Again, this might take time!",RedSocks157,0.040063944,0.004274376,0.021155577,0.00316676,0.018885271,0.005959799

"Agreed. I'm not going after everyday citizens or standard Reddit users.

The shit they are into is not just talking points for the election. They MUST be held accountable.##We still must drain the swamp.edit: Upon further thought, we need to make sure we're NOT hiding but are in fact sharing that she did do things like cheat during debates or rig the primaries against Bernie. These things speak to her character (lack of it), and they are just the surface. What's really been happening is much, much more severe and people need to get used to the fact that she's an evil, selfish woman. This never had anything to do with ""me vs. them"" or ""dems vs. repubs.""This deals with treason, human rights violations, selling of power and influence to the highest bidder, auctioning of ambassadorships, bribery for seats *in Obama's cabinet,* Benghazi cover up and the STILL existing email investigation for both her and the Clinton Foundation, stealing funds that were supposed to go to Haiti, ties to sex slaves / human trafficking, open borders, etc.This is only the beginning, and it's going to hurt a LOT of people if they're willing to face it. I believe many won't though, and we'll be back to us vs. them (thank the media narrative who are already spinning again) in no time.I think I'm going to make this an original post with this in it.. haha",NeenerNanner,0.082371958,0.004762752,0.035953278,0.003325504,0.02376787,0.006879974

"Keep in mind that Trump's unpinning philosophy is pure pragmatism. He is also a natural negotiator, and many of his positions/threats are meant purely as negotiating tactics (he's said so himself). As someone who has been watching him closely this election cycle, I think I can give fairly good predictions of what he'll do.>foreign policyHe won't end NATO, but countries will either have to pay their fair share, as stipulated by the treaty, or they'll no longer receive free protection from the US. He'll also shift NATO's missions towards fighting terrorism. This is something they've already made steps towards after he stated that they needed to do this. He's already started leading the world months before he was elected.>tradeThreats of tariffs are almost certainly a negotiating tactic designed to force other countries to behave. China, Mexico, and many other countries have taken advantage of our unwillingness to even put up a fight. Make no mistake, trade wars have been waged for decades and America has simply allowed itself to be attacked. And if other nations simply refuse to behave, Trump is absolutely willing to enact these tariffs. From a game theory perspective, his approach is the correct one. International trade is very much like the iterated prisoner's dilemma problem. Our current and past politicians had a policy of unconditional cooperation, leaving us open for exploitation. Trump will use tit-for-tat, which is cooperative, but willing to fight back against bad actors.>progressive policyTrump has given out a list of people he could nominate as SC judges, and that list has been praised by people on both sides of the aisle. They aren't extreme right wing, religious nuts, but there may be some changes. He wants things like abortion and marijuana to be returned to the states' control. His health care plan is detailed on his website, but the broad strokes are to implement more market-based solutions, such as increasing choice through cross-state insurance offerings and allowing all health care costs to be tax deductible. My hope is that this all leads to us getting health care away from the employer-provided model and to a more standard model (like how you buy car insurance), which would drive prices much lower due to people getting exactly the insurance plan they want. He has stated repeatedly that he wants to keep pre-existing conditions covered by insurance.",Commyende,0.026264227,0.003314073,0.014894784,0.00240952,0.012302113,0.004980388

"Hey there. First off, despite what you might think about us, I promise we all love this country and just want the best for it. We are not racist, sexist, violent, homophobic or anything else the media makes us out to be. Sure there are outliers, as there are with every candidate. Today, blacks, latinos, whites, men, women, etc. voted for Trump in large numbers.That said, there is still a lot of work to do. Trump's plan is not about isolationism or hatred. It's first and foremost about protecting Americans. That means through security and monetary means. He loves immigrants, he's married to one after all. You just have to do it legally, it's only fair and safe for our citizens. In Europe, the migrant crisis is a gigantic problem. The FBI and CIA have said ISIS and other terrorist groups will infiltrate the program into America. They already have in Europe. How do we protect ourselves while also helping out the families trying to escape war? Temporarily disable immigration from terrorist hotbeds and develop a system to extremely vet people from there. Obama did something similar in Iraq in 2011. Once that system is in place, we will let them in legally. In the meantime, we will help those wanting to escape war by building safe areas with our protection in neighboring countries.As far as our economy, focusing on Americans. Bringing jobs backs from overseas, negotiating better trade deals, lowering business regulations, less government involvement. Obamacare is really hurting businesses especially this next year. MAGA is taking what's working with our country and keeping it, and taking what's not working and changing it. Then there is the issue of corruption. It permeates Washington. People get positions based on how much money they donate. Special interests, Wall Street, lobbyists, banks all run Washington. In the leaks we even see that Obama's administration was picked by a bank. Giving people positions based on merit should be a start.All I can think of right now, but we can talk later when I'm not falling asleep in my chair!",LegendaryAmerican,0.040939409,0.003642791,0.020795945,0.00255442,0.015983737,0.00618183
"Thank you for your answer! I understand, and I recognize many of the ""bigots"" who support Trump are labeled as such by far left wingers who prevent logical and objective discussions to take place. My dad and I talked about it, and I realized he's pretty excited about a Trump presidency. After 9/11, Hillary apparently said that all Muslims should be placed in interment camps. She got the candidacy though corruption and lies, and she epitomizes the kind of shady politics you see in ""House of Cards"" (hopefully without all the murder). However, the things Trump had said haven't been too attractive either. But I see he's a gutsy motherfucker with a 10/10 wife, so we have a model as first lady ( Í¡Â° ÍœÊ– Í¡Â°). It's going to be interesting to see a man run this country who is not bound to fulfilling the kickbacks and favors that fuels the corruption in Washington. He's seen money, so he doesn't need that. He has a very unique opportunity to do something great for this country. News outlets don't realize that many folks found out their medical insurance premiums increased, driving them to vote for Trump in order to repeal Obamacare. His 100 day plan is sensible, and doesn't contain anything racially divisive. If he wants to build a wall, go ahead. There are processes in place to obtain a citizenship legally. Therefore, I see why Trump can be a positive figure in the political system, objectively speaking. The far left is fucking nuts, and maybe they need a reality check.",master_west,0.061634048,0.006732232,0.042858964,0.003307643,0.029734426,0.007570302
"It's nice talking to someone who voted for Hillary that is not saying I am a ""racist homophobe bigot"" for voting Trump. Refreshing really. Not sure how Trump is either honestly. The first 3 people announced to be in his administration are a gay man, a black man, and woman... yet the media tells us he hates those groups... The best part is, it has nothing to do with those reasons (sure it helps). But Ben Carson was the head of neurosurgeons at John Hopkins and an incredibly smart medical professional. He's gonna be in charge of healthcare and replacing Obamacare. Peter Thiel is a genius in the tech world, scouted Elon Musk and invested in him and started PayPal and helped invest in Facebook early. He'll be in charge of technology and innovation (advisor) to Trump. KellyAnne Conway helped Trump get elected, a guy who the entire media and world seemed to be against, with no backings and no help from either party, 95% of donations from the people, no help from PACs or special interests, and the biggest upset in political history. She will be in his administration too.3 people that are on his team and helping to run positions that they SHOULD BE AND DESERVE TO RUN BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCE. Not because of the color of their skin or their private parts (unlike Obama who Wikileaks showed picked people based on skin color or gender or big donors suggested by CitiBank who didn't have the necessary experience).He's not even in office and here's what's happened: stock markets have never been higher in our history, Russia wants peace with us now in letter from Putin, Israeli president overjoyed, Egyptian and Philippines presidents overjoyed, Canada and Mexican leaders already announced they are willing to rework NAFTA, etc. Because just a small threat from Trump holds weight. With Obama, they knew they could get away with anything (line in the sand). With Trump, if you don't do what you say, sorry too bad you're out. The threat of knowing that will keep people in line.Thanks for your positive outlook and willingness to give him a chance. If you can, please share your reasoning with any friends or family you have who are nervous. The media has painted Trump as Hitler for 2 years now, so people are acting accordingly.
